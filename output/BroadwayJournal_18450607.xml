FOUNTAINS.
</p><p>During this dusty weather there can hardly be a more agree-;
<lb/>able theme to dilate upon than that of Fountains. There is a 
<lb/>deliciously cool and dripping sound in the mere name. Our
<lb/>Broadway Fountains are the delight of the whole city, and
<lb/>considering how little they owe to art, they must be consider-
<lb break="no"/>ed the cheapest pleasure that could be provided for the enjoy-
<lb break="no"/>ment of the people. If it were possible to render a fountain
<lb/>altogether hideous and distasteful, the proprietors of Bowling
<lb/>Green and Union Square would have succeeded to a miracle.
<lb/>We have heard a story in respect to that in Bowling-Green,
<lb/>for the correctness of which we cannot vouch, although it
<lb/>seems to wear the appearance of truth. It is said that the ar-
<lb break="no"/>tist who made the designs for the rock-work of that fountain,
<lb/>went raving mad as soon as he had completed his drawings ;
<lb/>giving birth to so grand an idea entirely prostrated his mental
<lb/>powers, and his imagination has ever since been a wreck.
<lb/>We have seen a good many plans, and heard a good many sugges-
<lb break="no"/>tions for improving the Park Fountain, but we trust that it may
<lb/>forever be left in its present pure and simple state. Architec-
<lb break="no"/>ture can do nothing to beautify it; a single column of sparkling
<lb/>water rising from the ground to the height of forty or fifty feet,
<lb/>presents an appearance of simple grandeur and beauty that art
<lb/>can never improve. When there is a scanty supply of water,
<lb/>marble basins, Neptunes, dolphins and rivergods help to increase
<lb/>the effect and make a grand show ; but with an abundance of
<lb/>water any accessories, which are not in themselves beautiful,
<lb/>will only tend to destroy the simple majesty of a column of
<lb/>pure water. The fountain in Union Square looks, at times,
<lb/>not to speak irreverently, like a mere squirt when compared
<lb/>with its majestic brother in the Park. The fountains in Lon-
<lb break="no"/>don and Paris are among the chief ornaments of those cities.
<lb/>In London there are but three or four, which will not compare
<lb/>with ours ; those that have been recently erected in Trafalgar 
<lb/>Square are maintained at a very great expense, but are very 
<lb/>poor things. They are made of red granite highly polished, 
<lb/>and are in themselves very beautiful specimens of workman- 
<lb/>ship; they stand in the centre of a large stone basin, on a level 
<lb/>with the Square, and consist of a granite pedestal with four 
<lb/>heads of dolphins projecting therefrom, and supporting a tazza
<lb/>ten feet in diameter and another above of five feet, in the cen- 
<lb/>tre of which is something like a fire plug from which issues the 
<lb/>water to the height of four or five feet. The resemblance of 
<lb/>these fountains to dumb-waiters with the tops knocked off has
<lb/>given occasion to a good many witticisms among the cockneys
<lb/>who love nothing in this world, next to a lord, better than a
<lb/>joke, even though it be at their own expense. We have never
<lb/>seen these fountains, but they are said by amateurs and artists
<lb/>to be intensely ugly in their appearance. The water for their
<lb/>supply is procured from two wells sunk to the depth of three
<lb/>hundred and ninety-five feet from the surface, and at a distance 
<lb/>of three hundred and eighty feet from each other. The water, 
<lb/>after it has played through the jets, instead of being allowed to
<lb/>run to waste, is conveyed back to the engine house and again
<lb/>pumped up to the reservoir. Besides these two fountains in
<lb/>Trafalgar Square there are but two other small jets in London,</p><p></p><p>one in St. James’ Park, and one in the Temple Gardens, which
<lb/>Boz has immortalized in Martin Chuzzlewit as the trysting
<lb/>place of Tom Pinch’s sister and John Westlock. In Paris
<lb/>there are nearly seventy fountains, many of them of very great
<lb/>beauty, and all of them are large and elaborately decorated.
<lb/>With our proverbial love for grand names, no sooner had the
<lb/>Croton been introduced into our city than it was immediately
<lb/>dubbed the City of Fountains, but it will be a long time before
<lb/>we become as well entitled to the appellation as Paris. The
<lb/>Fountains in the Place de la Concorde are two in number, and
<lb/>are made of elaborately chased bronze from the same design.
<lb/>The lower basin of each is circular, of stone, fifty-two feet in
<lb/>diameter. In the centre is a group of colossal seated statues
<lb/>representing Ocean deities, and above an elaborately enriched
<lb/>plateau, twenty feet diameter, in the middle of which a group of
<lb/>children and swans surround the ornamental support of a re-
<lb break="no"/>versed tazza of ten feet diameter, in the centre of which issue
<lb/>jets from a centre flower. At the circumference of the lower
<lb/>basin there are six full-sized figures representing Tritons and
<lb/>Naiads, holding each a fish or a drill, from which, by a beauti-
<lb break="no"/>ful arrangement, water is thrown inwards into the large tazza
<lb/>above. By this arrangement and the addition of numerous
<lb/>smaller jets, a great diversity of effect is produced, giving an
<lb/>idea of breadth and a pleasing appearance of complexity, while
<lb/>the annoyance of a scattered shower of spray is avoided. The
<lb/>effect of these fountains when viewed from a short distance is
<lb/>extremely beautiful. Many of our readers are aware of the
<lb/>beauty of the magnificent vista, which, commencing at the Cham-
<lb break="no"/>ber of Deputies, comprises, in a perfectly straight line, the Bridge
<lb/>of Louis XVI, the two Fountains and the statues of the Place
<lb/>de la Concorde, the Obelisk of Luxor, the avenue of columns
<lb/>formed by the buildings of the Garde Meuble, and terminates
<lb/>with the beautiful church of the Madeleine. If there be anoth-
<lb break="no"/>er vista in the world that can rival this, it is that which inter-
<lb break="no"/>sects it at right angles, and which, commencing at the centre
<lb/>gate of the Tuilleries with its innumerable statues, includes the
<lb/>Obelisk of Luxor, at the intersection with the former vista, the
<lb/>grand Avenue of the Champs Elysees, and terminates at the vast
<lb/>triumphal arch of the Barriere de l’Etoile. Those only who have
<lb/>seen these incomparable views of fountains, statues, foliage,
<lb/>porticos, vases, orange trees, gilded balustrades and marble
<lb/>terraces, can have even a faint idea of their magnificence and
<lb/>beauty.</p><p></p><p>Long may it be before our own metropolis presents a vista
<lb/>to be compared with these ; we neither desire to see an accu-
<lb break="no"/>mulation of private wealth, nor to bear any portion of the taxes
<lb/>which would be indispensable to create them. While we have
<lb/>the Hudson and East rivers, the Battery, and the Bay, and the
<lb/>Croton in our streets, we have a succession of vistas from the
<lb/>foot of every street that crosses the city, of greater beauty and
<lb/>natural magnificence than any that art has given to Paris and
<lb/>London. The Fountain at Chatsworth, the seat of the Duke
<lb/>of Devonshire, is the highest in the world, and by way of dis-
<lb break="no"/>tinction is called the “ Emperor.’’ It consists, like our Park
<lb/>Fountain, of a single vertical jet rising from the surface of a lake,
<lb/>but to the height of two hundred and sixty-seven feet. The</p><p><pb n="354"/>
</p><p>reservoir is a natural lake at an elevation of three hundred and
<lb/>eighty- one feet. The next highest fountain in the world, is
<lb/>that of Wilhelm’s-hoeh, in Hesse Cassel, which plays one
<lb/>hundred and ninety feet. One of the Fountains at St. Cloud
<lb/>rises one hundred and sixty feet. The spire of Trinity church
<lb/>is, or will be two hundred and eighty feet; by comparison the
<lb/>grandeur of these magnificent jets will in a degree be realized.</p><p></p><p>Before we leave this subject of fountains, we will add a short
<lb/>extract from Savage Landor on the absurdity of elevating the
<lb/>statue of a hero on the top of a high column, as a hint to the
<lb/>many projectors of monuments to Washington, but for the
<lb/>special eye of Mr. Crawford and Mr. Catherwood. The satire
<lb/>is very pointed and highly polished ; and shows the absurdity,
<lb/>very clearly, of putting up a statue out of sight on top of a tall
<lb/>pillar.</p><p>“ Lysides, a young Athenian, has just returned to us from a
voyage in Thrace. .	.	. But Lysides will appear to you
</p><p>to have assumed a little more than the privileges of a traveller,
<lb/>in relating that the people have so imperfect a sense of religion
<lb/>as to bury the dead in the temples of the Gods, and the priests
<lb/>so avaricious and shameless as to claim money for the permis-
<lb break="no"/>sion of this impiety. ... He told us furthermore of a
<lb/>conqueror to whom a column has been erected, sixty cubits
<lb/>high, supporting his effigy in marble ! Imagine the general of
<lb/>an army standing upon a column sixty cubits high to show
<lb/>himself! A crane might do it after a victory over a pigmy ;
<lb/>or it might aptly represent the virtues of a rope dancer, exhi-
<lb break="no"/>biting how little he was subject to dizziness. I will write no
<lb/>more about it, for I begin to think some pretty Thracian has
<lb/>given poor Lysides a love potion, and that it has affected his
<lb/>brain a little. .	.</p><p></p><p>“ The mistake is really ludicrous. The column you must
<lb/>have perceived at once, was erected not to display the victor,
<lb/>but the vanquished. A blunder very easy for an idle observer
<lb/>to commit. Few of the Thracians, I conceive, even in the in-
<lb break="no"/>terior, are so utterly ignorant of Grecian arts, as to raise a
<lb/>statue to such a height above the ground, that the vision shill
<lb/>not comprehend all the features easily, and the spectator see
<lb/>and contemplate the object of his admiration as nearly and in 
<lb/>the same position as he was used to do in the Agora.”—Pe-
<lb break="no"/>ricles and Aspasia.</p><p></p><p>It is so long since the attempt was first made to build a mon-
<lb break="no"/>ument to the memory of Washington in this city ; the plans pre-
<lb break="no"/>sented to the public have been so numerous and so magnificent; 
<lb/>the patriotism, as manifested in resolutions and speeches at
<lb/>public meetings, so praiseworthy; the subscriptions have been
<lb/>so extensive and the results of all have been so small; that we
<lb/>have long since given up all expectation of ever seeing a
<lb/>Washington Monument in New York. The tittle plaster casts,
<lb/>from the very beautiful and appropriate model by Mr. Knee-
<lb break="no"/>land, we fear will be the only memento to the memory of
<lb/>Washington, that New York will ever erect.</p><p>MAGAZINE-WRITING—PETER SNOOK.
</p><p>In a late number of the Democratic Review, there appeared 
<lb/>a very excellent paper (by Mr. Duyckinck) on the subject of
<lb/>Magazine Literature—a subject much less thoroughly compre-
<lb break="no"/>hended here than either in France or in England. In America 
<lb/>we compose, now and then, agreeable essays and other matters 
<lb/>of that character—but we have not yet caught the true Maga- 
<lb/>zine spirit—a thing neither to be defined nor described. Mr. 
<lb/>Duyckinck’s article, although piquant, is not altogether to our
<lb/>mind. We think he places too low an estimate on the capa-
<lb break="no"/>bility of the Magazine paper. He is inclined to undervalue its
<lb/>power—to limit unnecessarily its province—which is illimita-
<lb break="no"/>ble. In fact it is in the extent of subject, and not less in the
<lb/>extent or variety of tone, that the French and English surpass
<lb/>us, to so good a purpose. How very rarely are we struck with
<lb/>an American Magazine article, as with an absolute novelty—
<lb/>how frequently the foreign articles so affect us! We are so</p><p></p><p>circumstanced as to be unable to pay for elaborate composi-
<lb break="no"/>tions—and, after all, the true invention is elaborate. There is
<lb/>no greater mistake than the supposition that a true originality
<lb/>is a mere matter of impulse or inspiration. To originate is
<lb/>carefully, patiently, and understandingly to combine. The few
<lb/>American Magazinists who ever think of this elaboration at all,
<lb/>cannot afford to carry it into practice for the paltry prices of-
<lb break="no"/>fered them by our periodical publishers. For this and other
<lb/>glaring reasons, we are behind the age in a very important
<lb/>branch of literature—a branch which, moreover, is daily grow-
<lb break="no"/>ing in importance—and which, in the end (not far distant) will
<lb/>be the most influential of all the departments of Letters.</p><p></p><p>We are lamentably deficient not only in invention proper, but
<lb/>in that which is, more strictly, Art. What American, for in-
<lb break="no"/>stance, in penning a criticism, ever supposes himself called
<lb/>upon to present his readers with more than the exact stipula-
<lb break="no"/>tion of his title—to present them with a criticism and some-
<lb break="no"/>thing beyond ? Who thinks of making his critique a work of
<lb/>art in itself—independently of its critical opinions ?—a work of
<lb/>art, such as are all the more elaborate, and most effective reviews
<lb/>of Macaulay. Yet these reviews we have evinced no incapacity
<lb/>to appreciate, when presented. The best American review
<lb/>ever penned is miserably ineffective when compared with the
<lb/>notice of Montagu’s Bacon—and yet this latter is in general
<lb/>a piece of tawdry sophistry, owing every thing to a consum-
<lb break="no"/>mate, to an exquisite arrangement—to a thorough and just suf-
<lb break="no"/>ficiently comprehensive diffuseness—to a masterly climacing of
<lb/>points—to a style which dazzles the understanding with its
<lb/>brilliancy—but not more than it misleads it by its perspicuity
<lb/>—causing us so distinctly to comprehend that we fancy we co-
<lb break="no"/>incide—in a word to the perfection of Art—of all the Art which
<lb/>a Macaulay can wield, or which is applicable to any criticism
<lb/>that a Macaulay could write.</p><p></p><p>It is, however, in the composition of that class of Magazine
<lb/>papers which come, properly, under the head of Tales, that we
<lb/>evince the most remarkable deficiency in skill. If we except
<lb/>first Mr. Hawthorne—secondly, Mr. Simms—thirdly Mr. Wil-
<lb break="no"/>lis—and fourthly, one or two others whom we may as well put
<lb/>mentally together without naming them—there is not even a
<lb/>respectably skilful tale-writer on this side the Atlantic. We
<lb/>have seen, to be sure, many very well-constructed stories—in
<lb/>dividual specimens—the work of American Magazinists ; but
<lb/>these specimens have invariably appeared to be happy acci-
<lb break="no"/>dents of construction; their authors, in subsequent tales, hav-
<lb break="no"/>ing always evinced an incapacity to construct.</p><p></p><p>We have been led to a comparison of the American with the
<lb/>British ability in tale-writing, by a perusal of some Magazine
<lb/>papers, the composition of the author of “Chartley” and “The
<lb/>Invisible Gentleman.” He is one of the best of the English
<lb/>journalists, and has some of the happiest peculiarities of Dick-
<lb break="no"/>ens, whom he preceded in the popular favor. The longest and
<lb/>best of his tales, properly so called, is “ Peter Snook,” and this
<lb/>presents so many striking points for the consideration of the
<lb/>Magazinist, that we feel disposed to give an account of it in
<lb/>full.</p><p></p><p>Peter Snook, the hero, and the beau ideal of a Cockney, is
<lb/>a retail linen-draper in Bishopgate street. He is of course a
<lb/>stupid and conceited, although at bottom a very good little fel-
<lb break="no"/>low, and “always looks as if he was frightened.” Matters go
<lb/>on very thrivingly with him, until he becomes acquainted with
<lb/>Miss Clarinda Bodkin, “a young lady owning to almost thirty,
<lb/>and withal a great proficient in the mysteries of millinery and
<lb/>mantua-making.” Love and ambition, however, set the little
<lb/>gentleman somewhat beside himself. “ If Miss Clarinda would
<lb/>but have me,” says he, “ we might divide the shop, and have
<lb/>a linen-drapery side, and a haberdashery and millinery side,</p><p><pb n="355"/>
</p><p>and one would help the other, There’d be only one rent to
<lb/>pay, and a double business—and it would be so comfortable
<lb/>too !” Thinking thus, Peter commences a flirtation, to which
<lb/>Miss Clarinda but doubtfully responds. He escorts the lady to
<lb/>White Conduit House, Bagnigge Wells, and other genteel
<lb/>places of public resort—and finally is so rash as to accede to
<lb/>the proposition on her part, of a trip to Margate. At this epoch
<lb/>of the narrative, the writer observes that the subsequent pro-
<lb break="no"/>ceedings of the hero are gathered from accounts rendered by
<lb/>himself, when called upon, after the trip, for explanation.</p><p></p><p>It is agreed that Miss Clarinda shall set out alone for Mar-
<lb break="no"/>gate—Mr. Snook following her, after some indispensable ar-
<lb break="no"/>rangements. These occupy him until the middle of July, at
<lb/>which period, taking passage in the “ Rose in June,” he safely
<lb/>reaches his destination. But various misfortunes here await
<lb/>him,—misfortunes admirably adapted to the meridian of Cock-
<lb break="no"/>ney feeling, and the capacity of Cockney endurance. His
<lb/>umbrella, for example, and a large brown paper parcel, con-
<lb break="no"/>taining a new pea-green coat and flower-patterned embroider-
<lb break="no"/>ed silk waistcoat, are tumbled into the water at the landing-
<lb break="no"/>place, and Miss Bodkin forbids him her presence in his old
<lb/>clothes. By a tumble of his own, too, the skin is rubbed from
<lb/>both his shins for several inches, and the surgeon, having no
<lb/>regard to the lover’s cotillon engagements, enjoins on him a
<lb/>total abstinence from dancing. A cock-chafer, moreover, is at
<lb/>the trouble of flying into one of his eyes, and (worse than all)
<lb/>a tall military-looking shoemaker, Mr. Last, has taken advan-
<lb break="no"/>tage of the linen-draper’s delay in reaching Margate, to ingra-
<lb break="no"/>tiate himself with his mistress. Finally, he is cut by Last
<lb/>and rejected by the lady, and has nothing left for it but to se-
<lb break="no"/>cure a homeward passage in the “ Rose in June.”</p><p></p><p>In the evening of the second day after his departure, the
<lb/>vessel drops anchor off Greenwich. Most of the passengers
<lb/>go ashore, with the view of taking the stage to the city. Peter,
<lb/>however, who considers that he has already spent money 
<lb/>enough to no purpose, prefers remaining on board. “We shall
<lb/>get to Billingsgate,” says he, “while I am sleeping, and I shall
<lb/>have plenty of time to go home and dress, and go into the city
<lb/>and borrow the trifle I may want for Pester and Company’s
<lb/>hill, that comes due the day after to-morrow.” This deter-
<lb break="no"/>mination is a source of much trouble to our hero, as will be
<lb/>seen in the sequel. Some shopmen who remain with him in
<lb/>the packet, tempt him to unusual indulgences in the way first,
<lb/>of brown stout, and secondly, of positive French brandy. The 
<lb/>consequence is, that Mr. Snook falls, thirdly, asleep, and fourth-
<lb break="no"/>ly, overboard.</p><p></p><p>About dawn on the morning after this event, Ephraim Hob- 
<lb/>son, the confidential clerk and factotum of Mr. Peter Snook,
<lb/>is disturbed from a sound sleep by the sudden appearance of
<lb/>his master. That gentleman seems to be quite in a bustle, and 
<lb/>delights Ephraim with an account of a whacking wholesale
<lb/>order for exportation just received. “ Not a word to anybody
<lb/>about the matter, exclaims Peter, with unusual emphasis. “ It’s
<lb/>such an opportunity as don’t come often in a man's life-time.
<lb/>There’s a captain of a ship—he’s the owner of her too ; but
<lb/>never mind ! there an’t time to enter into particulars now, but
<lb/>you’ll know all by and bye—all you have to do, is to do as I
<lb/>tell you—so come along!”</p><p></p><p>Setting Ephraim to work, with directions to pack up imme-
<lb break="no"/>diately all the goods in the shop, with the exception of a few
<lb/>trifling articles, the master avows his intention of going into
<lb/>the city, “ to borrow enough money to make up Pesters bill
<lb/>for to-morrow.” “ I don’t think you’ll want much, Sir,” re-
<lb break="no"/>turns Hobson with a self-complacent air. “ I’ve been looking
<lb/>up the long-winded ’uns you see, since you’ve been gone, and
<lb/>have got Shy’s money and Slack’s account, which we’d pretty</p><p></p><p>well given up for a bad job, and one or two more. There,—
<lb/>there’s the list—and there’s the key to the strong box, where
<lb/>you’ll find the money, besides what I’ve took at the counter."
<lb/>Peter at this seems well pleased, and shortly afterwards goes</p><p>out, saying, he cannot tell when he’ll be back, and giving di-
rections that whatever goods may be sent in during his absence,
shall be left untouched till his return.
</p><p>It appears that, after leaving his shop, Mr. Snook proceeded
<lb/>to that of Jobb, Flashbill &amp; Co. (one of whose clerks, on board
<lb/>the “ Rose In June,” had been very liberal in supplying our
<lb/>hero with brandy on the night of his ducking) looked over a
<lb/>large quantity of ducks and other goods, and finally made pur-
<lb break="no"/>chase of “ a choice assortment,” to be delivered the same day.
<lb/>His next visit was to Mr. Bluff, the managing partner in the
<lb/>banking-house where he usually kept his cash. His business
<lb/>now was to request permission to overdraw a hundred pounds
<lb/>for a few days.</p><p>“ Humph,’ said Mr. Bluff, “ money is very scarce but—Bless
</p><p>me !—yes—it’s he! Excuse me a minute, Mr. Snook, there’s a
<lb/>gentleman at the front counter whom I want particularly to speak
<lb/>to—I'll be back with you directly.” As he uttered these words, he
<lb/>rushed out, and, in passing one of the clerks on his way forward,
<lb/>be whispered—“ Tell Scribe to look at Snook’s account, and let
<lb/>me know directly.” He then went to the front counter, where se-
<lb break="no"/>veral people were waiting to pay and receive money. “ Fine
<lb/>weather this, Mr. Butt. What! you’re not out of town like the
<lb/>rest of them ?”</p><p></p><p>“ No," replied Mr. Butt, who kept a thriving gin-shop, “ no, I
<lb/>sticks to my business—make hay while the sun shines—that's my
<lb/>maxim. Wile up at night—I up early in the morning.”</p><p></p><p>The banker chatted and listened with great apparent interest till
<lb/>the closing of a huge book on which he kept his eye, told him that
<lb/>his whispered order had been attended to. He then took a gracious
<lb/>leave of Mr. Butt, and returned back to the counting-house with a
<lb/>slip of paper, adroitly put in his hand while passing, on which was
<lb/>written, " Peter Snook, Linen Draper, Bishopgate Street—old ac-
<lb break="no"/>count—increasing gradually—balance £153 15s. 6d.—very regu-
<lb break="no"/>lar.” “ Sorry to keep you waiting, Mr. Snook,” said he, “ but we
<lb/>must catch people when we can. Well, what is it you were saying
<lb/>( you wanted us to do ?”</p><p>“ I should like to be able to overdraw just for a few days,” re-
plied Peter.
“ How much ?”
“ A hundred.”
“ Won’t fifty do ?”
“ No, not quite, sir.”
” Well, you’re an honest fellow, and don’t come bothering us of-
ten, so I suppose we must not be too particular with you for this
once.”
</p><p>Leaving Bluff, Mr. Snook hurries to overtake Mr. Butt, the
<lb/>dealer in spirits, who had just left the banking-house before
<lb/>himself, and to give that gentleman an order for a hogshead
<lb/>of the best gin. As he is personally unknown to Mr. Butt,
<lb/>he hands him a card on which is written “ Peter Snook, linen
<lb/>and muslin ware house, No.—, Bishopgate street within,” etc.</p><p></p><p> etc., and takes occasion to mention that he purchases at the re-
<lb break="no"/>commendation of Mr. Bluff. The gin is to be at Queenhithe
<lb/>the same evening. The spirit-dealer, as soon as his new cus-
<lb break="no"/>tomer has taken leave, revolves in his mind the oddity of a
<lb/> linen draper’s buying a hogshead of gin, and determines to sa-
<lb break="no"/>tisfy himself of Mr. Snook’s responsibility by a personal appli-
<lb break="no"/>cation to Mr. Bluff. On reaching the bank, however, he is told
<lb/>by the clerks that Mr. Bluff, being in attendance upon a com-
<lb break="no"/>mittee of the House of Commons, will not be home in any rea-
<lb break="no"/>sonable time—but also that Peter Snook is a perfectly safe
<lb/>man. The gin is accordingly sent; and several other large
<lb/>orders for different goods, upon other houses, are promptly ful-
<lb break="no"/>filled in the same manner. Meantime Ephraim is busily en-
<lb break="no"/>gaged at home in receiving and inspecting the invoices of the
<lb/>various purchases as they arrive, at which employment he is
<lb/>occupied until dusk, when his master makes his appearance in
<lb/>unusually high spirits. We must here be pardoned for copying
<lb/>some passages :</p><p>“ Well, Ephraim,” he exclaimed, “ this looks something like
<pb n="356"/>
business! You havn’t had such a job this many a day ! Shop looks
well now, eh ?”
</p><p>“ You know best, sir,” replied Hobson. “ But hang me if I a’nt
<lb/>frightened. When we shall sell all these goods I’m sure I can’t think.
<lb/>You talked of having a haberdashery side to the shop ; but if we</p><p>go on at this rate, we shall want another side for ourselves;
’m sure I don’t know where Miss Bodkin is to be put.”
</p><p>“ She go to Jericho !” said Peter contemptuously. “ As for the
<lb/>goods, my boy, they’ll be gone before to-morrow morning. All
<lb/>you and I have got to do is to pack ’em up: so let us turn to and
<lb/>strap at it.”</p><p></p><p>Packing was Ephraim’s favorite employment, but on the pre-
<lb break="no"/>sent occasion he set to work with a heavy heart. His master, on
<lb/>the contrary, appeared full of life and spirits, and corded boxes,
<lb/>sewed up trusses, and packed huge paper parcels with a celerity
<lb/>and an adroitness truly wonderful.</p><p></p><p>“ Why, you don’t get on, Hobson,” he exclaimed ; “ see what
<lb/>I’ve done! Where’s the ink-pot ?—oh, here it is !” and he pro-
<lb break="no"/>ceeded to mark his packages with his initials and the letter G be-
<lb break="no"/>low. “ There,” he resumed, “ P. S. G. ; that’s for me at Graves-
<lb break="no"/>end. I’m to meet the Captain and owner there ; show the goods
<lb/>—if there’s any he don’t like shall bring ’em back with me ; get
<lb/>bills—bankers’ acceptances for the rest; see ’em safe on board
<lb/>then—but not before, mind that Master Ephraim! No, no, keep
<lb/>my weather eye open as the men say on board the Rose in June.
<lb/>By the bye, I havn’t told you yet about my falling overboard whap
<lb/>into the river.”</p><p>“ Falling overboard!" exclaimed the astonished shopman, quit-
ting his occupation to stand erect and listen.
</p><p>“ Ay, ay,” continued Peter—“ see it won’t do to tell you long
<lb/>stories now. There—mark that truss, will you ? Know all about
<lb/>it some day. Lucky job though—tell you that: got this thunder-
<lb break="no"/>ing order by it. Had one tumble, first going off, at Margate.
<lb/>Spoilt my peagreen—never mind—that was a lucky tumble too.
<lb/>Hadn't been for that, shouldn't so soon have found out the game a
<lb/>certain person was playing with me. She go to Jericho !”</p><p></p><p>But for the frequent repetition of this favorite expression, Eph-
<lb break="no"/>raim Hobson has since declared he should have doubted his mas-
<lb break="no"/>ter’s identity during the whole of that evening, as there was some-
<lb break="no"/>thing very singular about him ; and his strength and activity in
<lb/>moving the bales, boxes, and trusses, were such as he had never
<lb/>previously exhibited. The phrase condemning this, that, or the
<lb/>other thing or person to “ go to Jericho,” was the only expression
<lb/>that he uttered, as the shopman said, “ naturally,” and Peter re-
<lb break="no"/>peated that whimsical anathema as often as usual.</p><p></p><p>The goods being all packed up, carts arrive to carry them
<lb/>away; and, by half-past ten o’clock, the shop is entirely
<lb/>cleared, with the exception of some trifling articles to make
<lb/>show on the shelves and counters. Two hackney coaches are
<lb/>called. Mr. Peter Snook gets into one with a variety of loose
<lb/>articles which would require too much time to pack, and his
<lb/>shopman into another, with some more. Arriving at Queen-
<lb break="no"/>hithe, they find all the goods previously sent, already embarked
<lb/>in the hold of a long-decked barge which lies near the shore.
<lb/>Mr. Snook now insists upon Ephraim's going on board and
<lb/>taking supper and some hot rum and water. This advice he
<lb/>follows to so good purpose that he is at length completely
<lb/>bewildered, when his master, taking him up in his arms, carries
<lb/>him on shore, and there setting him down, leaves him to make
<lb/>the best of his way home as he can.</p><p></p><p>About eight the next morning, Ephraim awaking, of course
<lb/>in a sad condition both of body and mind, sets himself imme-
<lb break="no"/>diately about arranging the appearance of the shop “ so as to
<lb/>secure the credit of the concern.” In spite of all his ingenuity,
<lb/>however, it maintains a poverty-stricken appearance ;—which
<lb/>circumstance excites some most unreasonable suspicions in the
<lb/>mind of Mr. Bluff’s clerk, upon his calling at ten with Pester
<lb/>&amp; Co’.s bill, (three hundred and sixteen pounds, seventeen
<lb/>shillings) and receiving, by way of payment, a check upon his
<lb/>own banking house for the amount—Mr. Snook having written
<lb/>this check before his departure with the goods, and left it with
<lb/>Ephraim. On reaching the bank, therefore, the clerk inquires
<lb/>if Peter Snook’s check is good for three hundred and sixteen
<lb/>pounds odd, and is told that it is not worth a farthing, Mr. S.
<lb/>having overdrawn for a hundred. While Mr. Bluff and his as-
<lb break="no"/>sistants are conversing on this subject, Butt, the gin-dealer,
<lb/>calls to thank the banker for having recommended him a cus-
<lb break="no"/>tomer—which the banker denies having done. An explanation</p><p></p><p>ensues and “ stop thief!” is the cry. Ephraim is sent for and
<lb/>reluctantly made to tell all he knows of his master’s proceed-
<lb break="no"/>ings on the day before—by which means a knowledge is ob-
<lb break="no"/>tained of the other houses who (it is supposed) have been
<lb/>swindled. Getting a description of the barge which conveyed
<lb/>the goods from Queenhithe, the whole party of creditors now
<lb/>set off in pursuit.</p><p></p><p>About dawn the next morning they overtake the barge a lit-
<lb break="no"/>tle below Gravesend—when four men are observed leaving
<lb/>her, and rowing to the shore in a skiff. Peter Snook is found
<lb/>sitting quietly in the cabin, and, although apparently a little
<lb/>surprised at seeing Mr. Pester, betrays nothing like embarrass-
<lb break="no"/>ment or fear.</p><p></p><p>“ Ah, Mr. Pester, is it you ? Glad to see you, sir ! So you’ve
<lb/>been taking a trip out o’ town, and are going back with us ? We
<lb/>shall get to Billingsgate between eight and nine, they say ; and I
<lb/>hope it won’t be later, as I’ve a bill of yours comes due to-day, and
<lb/>I want to be at home in time to write a check for it.”</p><p></p><p>The goods are also found on board, together with three men
<lb/>in the hold, gagged and tied hand and foot. They give a
<lb/>strange account of themselves. Being in the employ of Mr.
<lb/>Heaviside, a lighterman, they were put in charge of “ The
<lb/>Flitter” when she was hired by Peter Snook for a trip to
<lb/>Gravesend. According to their orders they took the barge in
<lb/>the first instance to a wharf near Queenhithe and helped to
<lb/>load her with some goods brought down in carts. Mr.
<lb/>Snook afterwards came on board, bringing with him two fierce
<lb/>looking men, and “ a little man with a hooked nose” (Eph-
<lb break="no"/>raim.) Mr. S. and the little man then “ had a sort of jollifi-
<lb break="no"/>cation” in the cabin, till the latter got drunk and was carried
<lb/>ashore. They then proceeded down the river, nothing parti-
<lb break="no"/>cular occurring till they had passed Greenwich Hospital, when
<lb/>Mr. S. ordered them to lay the barge alongside a large black
<lb/>sided ship. No sooner was the order obeyed than they were
<lb/>boarded by a number of men from said ship, who seized them,
<lb/>bound them, gagged them and put them in the hold.</p><p></p><p>The immediate consequence of this information is, that Peter
<lb/>is bound, gagged, and put down into the hold in the same man-
<lb break="no"/>ner, by way of retaliation, and for safe keeping on his way
<lb/>back to the city. On the arrival of the party a meeting of
<lb/>the creditors is called. Peter appears before them in a great
<lb/>rage and with the air of an injured man. Indeed his behavior
<lb/>is so mal apropos to his situation as entirely to puzzle his in-
<lb break="no"/>terrogators. He accuses the whole party of a conspiracy.</p><p></p><p>" Peter Snook,” said Mr. Pester solemnly, from the chair, “ that
<lb/>look does not become you after what has passed. Let me advise
<lb/>you to conduct yourself with propriety. You will find that the
<lb/>best policy, depend on't.”</p><p></p><p>“ A pretty thing for you, for to come to talk of propriety !” ex-
<lb break="no"/>claimed Peter; “ you that seed me laid bold on by a set of ruffians,
<lb/>and never said a word, nor given information a'terwards ! And
<lb/>here have I been kept away from business I don't know how
<lb/>long, and shut up like a dog in a kennel; but I look upon’t you
<lb/>were at the bottom of it all—you and that follow with the plum-
<lb break="no"/>pudding face, as blowed me up about a cask of gin ! What you
<lb/>both mean by it I can't think ; but if there’s any law in the land,
<lb/>I’ll make you remember it, both of you—that’s what I will!”</p><p></p><p>Mr. Snook swears that he never saw Jobb in his life except
<lb/>on the occasion of his capture in “ The Flitter,” and positively
<lb/>denies having looked out any parcel of goods at the house of
<lb/>Jobb, Flashbill &amp; Co. With the banker, Mr. Bluff, he ac-
<lb break="no"/>knowledges an acquaintance—but not having drawn for the
<lb/>two hundred and seventy pounds odd, or having ever over-
<lb break="no"/>drawn for a shilling in his life. Moreover he is clearly of
<lb/>opinion that the banker has still in his hands more than a hun-
<lb break="no"/>dred and fifty pounds of his (Mr. Snook's) money. He also
<lb/>designates several gentlemen as being no creditors of his, al-
<lb break="no"/>though they were of the number of those from whom large
<lb/>purchases had been made for the “ whacking” shipping order,</p><p><pb n="357"/>
</p><p>and although their goods were found in the “ Flitter.” Eph-
<lb break="no"/>raim is summoned, and testifies to all the particulars of his
<lb/>master’s return, and the subsequent packing, cart-loading and
<lb/>embarkation as already told—accounting for the extravagances
<lb/>of Mr. Snook as being “ all along of that Miss Bodkin.”</p><p>“ Lor’, master, hi’s glad to see you agin,” exclaimed Ephraim.
“ Who’d ha’ thought as ’twould come to this ?”
</p><p>“ Come to what?” cried Peter. “ I’ll make ’em repent of it,
<lb/>every man Jack of ’em, before I’ve done, if there’s law to be bad
<lb/>for love or money !”</p><p></p><p>“Ah, sir,” said Ephraim, “ we’d better have stuck to the retail.
<lb/>I was afraid that shipping consarn wouldn’t answer, and tell'd you
<lb/>so, if you recollect, but you would’nt barken to me.”</p><p>“ What shipping concern?” inquired Peter, with a look of amaze-
ment.
</p><p>“ La ! master," exclaimed Ephraim, “ it aint of any use to pre-
<lb break="no"/>tend to keep it a secret now, when every body' knows it. I
<lb/>didn't tell Mr. Pester, though, till the last, when all the goods was
<lb/>gone out of the shop, and the sheriff’s officers had come to take
<lb/>possession of the house.”</p><p></p><p>“ Sheriff’s officers in possession of my house !” roared Peter. All
<lb/>the goods gone out of the shop ! What do you mean by that you
<lb/>rascal ? What have you been doiug in my absence ?” And he
<lb/>sprang forward furiously, and seized the trembling shopman by
<lb/>the collar with a degree of violence which rendered it difficult for
<lb/>the two officers in attendance to disengage him from his hold.</p><p></p><p>Hereupon, Mr. Snap, the attorney retained by the creditors,
<lb/>harrangues the company at some length, and intimates that
<lb/>Mr. Snook is either mad or acting the madman for the purpose 
<lb/>of evading punishment. A practitioner from Bedlam is sent
<lb/>for, and some artifices resorted to—but to no purpose. It is
<lb/>found impossible to decide upon the question of sanity. The
<lb/>medical gentleman, in his report to the creditors, confesses
<lb/>himself utterly perplexed, and, without giving a decision, de-
<lb break="no"/>tails the particulars of a singular story told him by Mr. Snook
<lb/>himself, concerning the mode of his escape from drowning al-
<lb break="no"/>ter he fell overboard from the “ Rose in June.” “ It is a
<lb/>strange unlikely tale to be sure,” says the physician, “ and if
<lb/>his general conversation was of that wild, imaginative, flighty
<lb/>kind which I have so often witnessed, I should say it was 
<lb/>purely ideal ; but he appears such a plain-spoken, simple sort
<lb/>of a person, that it is difficult to conceive how he could invent
<lb/>such a fiction.” Mr. Snook’s narration is then told, not in his
<lb/>very words, but in the author’s own way, with all the particu-
<lb break="no"/>lars obtained from Peter's various recitations. We give it only
<lb/>in brief.</p><p></p><p>Upon tumbling overboard, Mr. Snook (at least according to
<lb/>his own story) swam courageously as long as he could. He
<lb/>was upon the point of sinking, however, when an oar was
<lb/>thrust under his arm, and he found himself lifted in a boat by
<lb/>a “ dozen dark-looking men.” He is taken on board a large
<lb/>ship, and the captain, who is a droll genius, and talks in rhyme
<lb/>somewhat after the fashion of the wondrous Tale of Alroy,
<lb/>entertains him with great cordiality, dresses him in a suit of
<lb/>his own clothes, makes him drink in the first place, a brimmer
<lb/>of “ something hot,” and afterwards plies him with wines and
<lb/>cordials of all kinds, at a supper of the most magnificent de-
<lb break="no"/>scription. Warmed in body and mind by this excellent cheer,
<lb/>Peter reveals his inmost secrets to his host, and talks freely
<lb/>and minutely of a thousand things ; of his man Ephraim and
<lb/>his oddities ; of his bank account; of his great credit; of his 
<lb/>adventures with Miss Bodkin; of his prospects in trade; and
<lb/>especially of the names, residences, etc. etc., of the wholesale
<lb/>houses with whom he is in the habit of dealing. Presently,
<lb/>being somewhat overcome with wine, he goes to bed at the
<lb/>suggestion of the captain, who promises to call him in season
<lb/>for a boat in the morning, which will convey him to Billings-
<lb break="no"/>gate in full time for Pester and Co’s note. How long he slept
<lb/>is uncertain—but when he awoke a great change was observa-
<lb break="no"/>ble in the captain’s manner, who was somewhat brusque, and
<lb/>handed him over the ship’s side into the barge where he was</p><p>discovered by the creditors in pursuit, and which he was as-
sured would convey him to Billingsgate.
</p><p>This relation, thus succinctly given by us, implies little or
<lb/>nothing. The result, however, to which the reader is ingeni-
<lb break="no"/>ously led by the author, is, that the real Peter Snook has been
<lb/>duped, and that the Peter Snook who made the various pur-
<lb break="no"/>chases about town, and who appeared to Ephraim only during the
<lb/>morning and evening twilight of the eventful day, was, in fact,
<lb/>no other person than the captain of “ the strange black-sided
<lb/>ship.” We are to believe that, taking advantage of Peter’s
<lb/>communicativeness, and a certain degree of personal resem-
<lb break="no"/>blance to himself, he assumed our hero’s clothes while he slept,
<lb/>and made a bold and nearly successful attempt at wholesale
<lb/>peculation.</p><p></p><p>The incidents of this story are forcibly conceived, and even
<lb/>in the hands of an ordinary writer would scarcely fail of effect.
<lb/>But, in the present instance, so unusual a tact is developed in
<lb/>the narration, that we are inclined to rank “Peter Snook”
<lb/>among the few tales which (each in its own way) are absolute-
<lb break="no"/>ly faultless. It is a Flemish home-piece of the highest order
<lb/>—its merits lying in its chiaro ’scuro—in that blending of light
<lb/>and shade and shadow, where nothing is too distinct, yet where
<lb/>the idea is fully conveyed—in the absence of all rigid outlines
<lb/>and all miniature painting—in the not undue warmth of the
<lb/>coloring—and in a well subdued exaggeration at all points—an
<lb/>exaggeration never amounting to caricature.</p><p>THE ASSIGNATION.
Stay for me there! I will not fail
To meet thee in that hollow vale.
[Exequy on the death of his wife, by Henry King, Bishop of
Chichester.]
</p><p>Ill-fated and mysterious man !—bewildered in the brilliancy
<lb/>of thine own imagination, and fallen in the flames of thine own
<lb/>youth! Again in fancy I behold thee! Once more thy form
<lb/>hath risen before me !—not—oh not as thou art—in the cold
<lb/>valley and shadow—but as thou shouldst be—squandering away
<lb/>a life of magnificent meditation in that city of dim visions, thine
<lb/>own Venice—which is a star-beloved Elysium of the sea, and
<lb/>the wide windows of whose Palladian palaces look down with a
<lb/>deep and bitter meaning upon the secrets of her silent waters.
<lb/>Yes ! I repeat it—as thou shouldst be. There are surely other
<lb/>worlds than this—other thoughts than the thoughts of the mul-
<lb break="no"/>titude—other speculations than the speculations of the sophist.
<lb/>Who then shall call thy conduct into question ? who blame thee
<lb/>for thy visionary hours, or denounce those occupations as a wast-
<lb break="no"/>ing away of life, which were but the overflowings of thine
<lb/>everlasting energies ?</p><p></p><p>It was at Venice, beneath the covered archway there called
<lb/>the Ponte di Sospiri, that I met for the third or fourth time the
<lb/>person of whom I speak. It is with a confused recollection that
<lb/>I bring to mind the circumstances of that meeting. Yet I re-
<lb break="no"/>member—ah ! how should I forget ?—the deep midnight, the
<lb/>Bridge of Sighs, the beauty of woman, and the Genius of
<lb/>Romance that stalked up and down the narrow canal.</p><p></p><p>It was a night of unusual gloom. The great clock of the
<lb/>Piazza had sounded the fifth hour of the Italian evening. The
<lb/>square of the Campanile lay silent and deserted, and the lights
<lb/>in the old Ducal Palace were dying fast away. I was returning
<lb/>home from the Piazetta, by way of the Grand Canal. But as
<lb/>my gondola arrived opposite the mouth of the canal San Marco,
<lb/>a female voice from its recesses broke suddenly upon the night,
<lb/>in one wild, hysterical, and long continued shriek. Startled at
<lb/>the sound, I sprang upon my feet: while the gondolier, letting
<lb/>slip his single oar, lost it in the pitchy darkness beyond a chance
<lb/>of recovery, and we were consequently left to the guidance of
<lb/>the current which here sets from the greater into the smaller
<lb/>channel. Like some huge and sable-feathered condor, we were
<lb/>slowly drifting down towards the Bridge of Sighs, when a thou-
<lb break="no"/>sand flambeaux flashing from the windows, and down the
<lb/>staircases of the Ducal Palace, turned all at once that deep gloom
<lb/>into a livid and preternatural day.</p><p>A child, slipping from the arms of its own mother, had fallen
<pb n="358"/>
</p><p>from an upper window of the lofty structure into the deep and
<lb/>dim canal. The quiet waters had closed placidly over their
<lb/>victim; and, although my own gondola was the only one in sight,
<lb/>many a stout swimmer, already in the stream, was seeking in
<lb/>vain upon the surface, the treasure which was to be found, alas!
<lb/>only within the abyss. Upon the broad black marble flagstones
<lb/>at the entrance of the palace, and a few steps above the water,
<lb/>stood a figure which none who then saw can have ever since
<lb/>forgotten. It was the Marchesa Aphrodite—the adoration of
<lb/>all Venice—the gayest of the gay—the most lovely where all
<lb/>were beautiful—but still the young wife of the old and intrigu-
<lb break="no"/>ing Mentoni, and the mother of that fair child, her first and only
<lb/>one, who now deep beneath the murky water, was thinking in
<lb/>bitterness of heart upon her sweet caresses, and exhausting its
<lb/>little life in struggles to call upon her name.</p><p></p><p>She stood alone. Her small, bare, and silvery feet gleamed
<lb/>in the black mirror of marble beneath her. Her hair, not as yet
<lb/>more than half loosened for the night from its ball-room array,
<lb/>clustered, amid a shower of diamonds, round and round her
<lb/>classical head, in curls like those of the young hyacinth. A
<lb/>snowy-white and gauze-like drapery seemed to be nearly the
<lb/>sole covering to her delicate form; but the mid-summer and
<lb/>midnight air was hot, sullen, and still, and no motion in the sta-
<lb break="no"/>tue-like form itself, stirred even the folds of that raiment of very
<lb/>vapor which hung around it as the heavy marble hangs around
<lb/>the Niobe. Yet—strange to say!—her large lustrous eyes
<lb/>were not turned downwards upon that grave wherein her
<lb/>brightest hope lay buried—but riveted in a widely different
<lb/>direction ! The prison of the Old Republic is, I think, the stat-
<lb break="no"/>liest building in all Venice—but how could that lady gaze so
<lb/>fixedly upon it, when beneath her lay stifling her only child ?
<lb/>Yon dark, gloomy niche, too, yawns right opposite her chamber
<lb/>window—what, then, could there be in its shadows—in its
<lb/>architecture—in its ivy-wreathed and solemn cornices—that the
<lb/>Marchesa di Mentoni had not wondered at a thousand times
<lb/>before ? Nonsense !—Who does not remember that, at such a
<lb/>time as this, the eye, like a shattered mirror, multiplies the images
<lb/>of its sorrow, and sees in innumerable far off places, the wo
<lb/>which is close at hand ?</p><p></p><p>Many steps above the Marchesa, and within the arch of the
<lb/>water-gate, stood, in full dress, the Satyr-like figure of Mentoni
<lb/>himself. He was occasionally occupied in thrumming a guitar,
<lb/>and seemed ennuyc to the very death, as at intervals he gave
<lb/>directions for the recovery of his child. Stupified and aghast, I
<lb/>had myself no power to move from the upright position I had
<lb/>assumed upon first hearing the shriek, and must have presented
<lb/>to the eyes of the agitated group a spectral and ominous appear-
<lb break="no"/>ance, as with pale countenance and rigid limbs, I floated down
<lb/>among them in that funereal gondola,</p><p></p><p>All efforts proved in vain. Many of the most energetic in the
<lb/>search were relaxing their exertions, and yielding to a gloomy
<lb/>sorrow. There seemed but little hope for the child; (how much
<lb/>less than for the mother!) but now, from the interior of that
<lb/>dark niche which has been already mentioned as forming a part
<lb/>of the Old Republican prison, and as fronting the lattice of the
<lb/>Marchesa, a figure muffled in a cloak, stepped out within reach
<lb/>of the light, and, pausing a moment upon the verge of the giddy
<lb/>descent, plunged headlong into the canal. As, in an instant
<lb/>afterwards, he stood with the still living and breathing child
<lb/>within his grasp, upon the marble flagstones by the side of the
<lb/>Marchesa, his cloak, heavy with the drenching water, became
<lb/>unfastened, and, falling in folds about his feet, discovered to the
<lb/>wonder-stricken spectators the graceful person of a very young
<lb/>man, with the sound of whose name the greater part of Europe
<lb/>was then ringing.</p><p></p><p>No word spoke the deliverer. But the Marchesa! She will
<lb/>now receive her child—she will press it to her heart—she will
<lb/>cling to its little form, and smother it with her caresses. Alas!
<lb/>another's arms have taken it from the stranger—another’s
<lb/>arms have taken it away, and borne it afar off, unno-
<lb break="no"/>ticed, into the palace ! And the Marchesa! Her lip—her
<lb/>beautiful lip trembles: tears are gathering in her eyes—those
<lb/>eves which, like Pliny’s acanthus, are “soft and almost liquid.”
<lb/>Yes, tears are gathering in those eyes—and see! the entire
<lb/>woman thrills throughout the soul, and the statue has started into
<lb/>life! The pallor of the marble countenance, the swelling of
<lb/>the marble Bosom, the very purity of the marble feet, we behold
<lb/>suddenly flushed over with a tide of ungovernable crimson; and
<lb/>a slight shudder quivers about her delicate frame, as a gentle
<lb/>air at Napoli about the rich silver lilies in the grass.</p><p>Why should that lady blush! To this demand there is no
answer—except that, having left, in the eager haste and terror
</p><p>of a mother’s heart, the privacy of her own boudoir, she has neg-
<lb break="no"/>lected to enthral her tiny feet in their slippers, and utterly
<lb/>forgotten to throw over her Venitian shoulders that drapery
<lb/>which is their due. What other possible reason could there
<lb/>have been for her so blushing ?—for the glance of those wild
<lb/>appealing eyes?—for the unusual tumult of that throbbing
<lb/>bosom ?—for the convulsive pressure of that trembling hand ?—
<lb/>that hand which fell, as Mentoni turned into the palace, acciden-
<lb break="no"/>tally, upon the hand of the stranger. What reason could there
<lb/>have been for the low—the singularly low tone of those
<lb/>unmeaning words which the lady uttered hurriedly in bidding
<lb/>him adieu ? “Thou hast conquered”—she said, or the murmurs
<lb/>of the water deceived me—“thou hast conquered—one hour
<lb/>after sunrise—we shall meet—so let it be !”</p><p>***** *
</p><p>The tumult had subsided, the lights had died away within
<lb/>the palace, and the stranger, whom I now recognised, stood
<lb/>alone upon the flags. He shook with inconceivable agitation,
<lb/>and his eye glanced around in search of a gondola. I could not
<lb/>do less than offer him the service of my own; and he accepted
<lb/>the civility. Having obtained an oar at the water-gate, we
<lb/>proceeded together to his residence, while he rapidly recovered
<lb/>his self-possession, and spoke of our former slight acquaintance
<lb/>in terms of great apparent cordiality.</p><p></p><p>There are some subjects upon which I take pleasure in being
<lb/>minute. The person of the stranger—let me call him by this
<lb/>title, who to all the world was still a stranger—the person of
<lb/>the stranger is one of these subjects. In height he might have
<lb/>been below rather than above the medium size: although there
<lb/>were moments of intense passion when his frame actually
<lb/>expanded and belied the assertion. The light, almost slender
<lb/>symmetry of his figure, promised more of that ready activity
<lb/>which he evinced at the Bridge of Sighs, than of that Herculean
<lb/>strength which he has been known to wield without an effort,
<lb/>upon occasions of more dangerous emergency. With the mouth
<lb/>and chin of a deity—singular, wild, lull, liquid eyes, whose
<lb/>shadows varied from pure hazel to intense and brilliant jet—and
<lb/>a profusion of curling, black hair, from which a forehead of unu-
<lb break="no"/>sual breadth gleamed forth at intervals all light and ivory—his
<lb/>were features than which I have seen none more classically
<lb/>regular, except, perhaps, the marble ones of the Emperor Com-
<lb break="no"/>modus. Yet his countenance was, nevertheless, one of those
<lb/>which all men have seen at some period of their lives, and have
<lb/>never afterwards seen again. It had no peculiar—it had no
<lb/>settled predominant expression to be fastened upon the memory;
<lb/>a countenance seen and instantly forgotten—but forgotten with
<lb/>a vague and never-ceasing desire of recalling it to mind. Not
<lb/>that the spirit of each rapid passion failed, at any time, to throw
<lb/>its own distinct image upon the mirror of that face—but that
<lb/>the mirror, mirror-like, retained no vestige of the passion, when
<lb/>the passion had departed.</p><p></p><p>Upon leaving him on the night of our adventure, he solicited
<lb/>me, in what I thought an urgent manner, to call upon him very
<lb/>early the next morning. Shortly after sunrise, I found myself
<lb/>accordingly at his Palazzo, one of those huge structures of
<lb/>gloomy, yet fantastic pomp, which tower above the waters of the
<lb/>Grand Canal in the vicinity of the Rialto. I was shown up a
<lb/>broad winding staircase of mosaics, into an apartment whose
<lb/>unparalleled splendor burst through the opening door with an
<lb/>actual glare, making me blind and dizzy with luxuriousness.</p><p></p><p>I knew my acquaintance to be wealthy. Report had spoken
<lb/>of his possessions in terms which I had even ventured to call
<lb/>terms of ridiculous exaggeration. But as I gazed about me, I
<lb/>could not bring myself to believe that the wealth of any subject
<lb/>in Europe could have supplied the princely magnificence which
<lb/>burned and blazed around.</p><p></p><p>Although, as I say, the sun had arisen, yet the room was still
<lb/>brilliantly lighted up. I judged from this circumstance, as well
<lb/>as from an air of exhaustion in the countenance of my friend,
<lb/>that he had not retired to bed during the whole of the preceding
<lb/>night. In the architecture and embellishments of the chamber,
<lb/>the evident design had been to dazzle and astound. Little atten-
<lb break="no"/>tion had been paid to the decora of what is technically called
<lb/>keeping, or to the proprieties of nationality. The eye wandered
<lb/>from object to object, and rested upon none—neither the grotes-
<lb break="no"/>ques of the Greek painters, nor the sculptures of the best Italian
<lb/>days, nor the huge carvings of untutored Egypt. Rich draperies
<lb/>in every part of the room trembled to the vibration of low, me-
<lb break="no"/>lancholy music, whose or gin was not to be discovered. The
<lb/>senses were oppressed by mingled and conflicting perfume
<lb/>reeking up from strange convolute censers, together with mu-
<lb break="no"/>titudinous flaring and flickering tongues of emerald and violet fire.</p><p><pb n="359"/>
</p><p>The rays of the newly risen sun poured in upon the whole,
<lb/>through windows formed each of a single pane of crimson-tinted
<lb/>glass. Glancing to and fro, in a thousand reflections, from
<lb/>curtains which rolled from their cornices like cataracts of molten 
<lb/>silver, the beams of natural glory mingled at length fitfully with
<lb/>the artificial light, and lay weltering in subdued masses upon
<lb/>a carpet of rich, liquid-looking cloth of Chili gold.</p><p></p><p>li Ha! ha! ha!—ha! ha! ha ! ”—laughed the proprietor,
<lb/>motion ng me to a seat as I entered the room, and throwing
<lb/>himself back at full length upon an ottoman. “ I see," said he.
<lb/>perceiving that I could not immediately reconcile myself to the
<lb/>bienseance of so singular a welcome—“ I see you are astonished 
<lb/>at my apartment—at my statues—my pictures—my originality
<lb/>of conception in architecture and upholstery—absolutely drunk,
<lb/>eh ? with my magnificence. But pardon me, my dear sir, (here
<lb/>his tone of voice dropped to the very spirit of cordiality,) pardon
<lb/>me for my uncharitable laughter, you appeared so utterly
<lb/>astonished. Besides, some things are so completely ludicrous
<lb/>that a man must laugh or die. To die laughing must be the</p><p>most glorious of all glorious deaths! Sir Thomas More—a
</p><p>very fine man was Sir Thomas More—Sir Thomas More died
<lb/>laughing, you remember. Also in the Absurdities of Ravisius
<lb/>Textor, there is a long list characters who came to the same
<lb/>magnificent end. Do you know, however,” continued he mus-
<lb break="no"/>ingly, “ that at Sparta (which is now Palaeochori), at Sparta, I
<lb/>say, to the west of the citadel, among a chaos of scarcely visible
<lb/>ruins, is a kind of socle upon which are still legible the letters 
<lb/>AAZM. They are undoubtedly part of TEAAZMA. Now at
<lb/>Sparta were a thousand temples and shrines to a thousand 
<lb/>different divinities. How exceedingly strange that the altar of
<lb/>Laughter should have survived all the others ! But in the pre-
<lb break="no"/>sent instance," he resumed, with a singular alteration of voice
<lb/>and manner, “ I have no right to be merry at your expense.
<lb/>You might well have been amazed. Europe cannot produce
<lb/>anything so fine as this, my little regal cabinet. My other
<lb/>apartments are by no means of the same order; mere ultras of
<lb/>fashionable insipidity. This is better than fashion—is it not ?
<lb/>Yet this has but to be seen to become the rage—that is, with
<lb/>those who could afford it at the cost of their entire patrimony.</p><p></p><p>I have guarded, however, against any such profanation. With
<lb/>one exception you are the only human being besides myself and
<lb/>my valet, who has been admitted within the mysteries of these
<lb/>imperial precincts, since they have been bedizzened as you see!”</p><p></p><p>I bowed in acknowledgment: for the overpowering sense of
<lb/>splendor and perfume, and music, together with the unexpected
<lb/>eccentricity of his address and manner, prevented me from ex-
<lb break="no"/>pressing, in words, my appreciation of what I might have
<lb/>construed into a compliment.</p><p></p><p>“ Here,” he resumed, arising and leaning on my arm as he
<lb/>sauntered around the apartment, “ here are paintings from the
<lb/>Greeks to Cimabue, and from Cimabue to the present hour.
<lb/>Many are chosen, as you see, with little deference to the opini-
<lb break="no"/>ons of Virtu. They are all, however, fitting tapestry for a
<lb/>chamber such as this. Here too, are some chef d'oeuvres of the
<lb/>unknown great—and here unfinished designs by men, celebrated
<lb/>in their day, whose very names the perspicacity of the aca-
<lb break="no"/>demies has left to silence and to me. What think you,” said
<lb/>he, turning abruptly as he spoke—“ what think you of this
<lb/>Madonna della Pieta ?”</p><p></p><p>“ It is Guido’s own !” I said with all the enthusiasm of my
<lb/>nature, for I had been poring intently over its surpassing loveli-
<lb break="no"/>ness. “ It is Guido’s own!—how could you have obtained it ?—
<lb/>she is undoubtedly in painting what the Venus is in sculpture.”</p><p></p><p>“ Ha !’’ said he thoughtfully, “ the Venus—the beautiful
<lb/>Venus ?—the Venus of the Medici ?—she of the diminutive
<lb/>head and the gilded hair ? Part of the left arm (here his voice
<lb/>dropped so as to be heard with difficulty), and all the right are
<lb/>restorations, and in the coquetry of that right arm lies, I think,
<lb/>the quintessence of all affectation. Give me the Canova! The
<lb/>Apollo, too !—is a copy—there can be no doubt of it—blind fool
<lb/>that I am, who cannot behold the boasted inspiration of the
<lb/>Apollo ! I cannot help—pity me !—I cannot help preferring
<lb/>the Antinous. Was it not Socrates who said that the statuary
<lb/>found his statue in the block of marble ? Then Michel Angelo
<lb/>was by no means original in his couplet—</p><p>' Non ba 1’ottimo artista alcun concetto
Che uu marmo solo in se non circunscriva.' ”
</p><p>It has been, or should be remarked, that, in the manner of
<lb/>the true gentleman, we are always aware of a difference from
<lb/>the bearing of the vulgar, without being at once precisely able 
<lb/>to determine in what such difference consists. Allowing the </p><p></p><p>remark to have applied in its full force to the outward demean-
<lb break="no"/>or of my acquaintance, I felt it, on that eventful morning, still
<lb/>more fully applicable to his moral temperament and character.
<lb/>Nor can I better define that peculiarity of spirit which seemed
<lb/>to place him so essentially apart from all other human beings,
<lb/>than by calling it a habit of intense and continual thought, per-
<lb break="no"/>vading even his most trivial actions—intruding upon his mo-
<lb break="no"/>ments of dalliance—and interweaving itself with his very flash-
<lb break="no"/>es of merriment—like adders which writhe from out the eyes
<lb/>of the grinning masks in the cornices around the temples of
<lb/>Persepolis.</p><p></p><p>I could not help, however, repeatedly observing, through the
<lb/>mingled tone of levity and solemnity with which he rapidly de-
<lb break="no"/>scanted upon matters of little importance, a certain air of trep-
<lb break="no"/>idation—a degree of nervous unction in action and in speech—
<lb/>an unquiet excitability of manner which appeared to me at all
<lb/>times unaccountable, and upon some occasions even filled me
<lb/>with alarm. Frequently, too, pausing in the middle of a sen-
<lb break="no"/>tence whose commencement he had apparently forgotten, he
<lb/>seemed to be listening in the deepest attention, as if either in
<lb/>momentary expectation of a visiter, or to sounds which must
<lb/>have had existence in his imagination alone.</p><p></p><p>It was during one of these reveries or pauses of apparent
<lb/>abstraction, that, in turning over a page of the poet and schol-
<lb break="no"/>ar Politian’s beautiful tragedy “ The Orfeo,” (the first native
<lb/>Italian tragedy,) which lay near me upon an ottoman, I discover-
<lb break="no"/>ed a passage underlined in pencil. It was a passage towards
<lb/>the end of the third act—a passage of the most heart-stirring
<lb/>excitement—=a passage which, although tainted with impurity,
<lb/>no man shall read without a thrill of novel emotion—no wo-
<lb break="no"/>man without a sigh. The whole page was blotted with fresh
<lb/>tears, and, upon the opposite interleaf, were the following Eng-
<lb break="no"/>lish lines, written in a hand so very different from the peculiar
<lb/>characters of my acquaintance, that I had some difficulty in
<lb/>recognising it as his own.</p><p>Thou wast that all to me, love,
For which my soul did pine—
A green isle in the sea, love,
A fountain and a shrine,
All wreathed with fairy fruits and flowers;
And all the flowers were mine.
Ah, dream too bright to last;
Ah, starry Hope that didst arise
But to be overcast!
</p><p>A voice from out the Future cries
<lb/>“ Onward!"—but o’er the Past
<lb/>(Dim gulf!) my spirit hovering lies,</p><p>Mute, motionless, aghast!.
For alas! alas! with me
The light of life is o'er.
“ No more—no more—no more,"
(Such language holds the solemn sea
To the sands upon the shore,)
Shall bloom the thunder-blasted tree,
Or the stricken eagle soar!
Now all my hours are trances;
And all my nightly dreams
Are where thy dark eye glances,
And where thy footstep gleams,
In what ethereal dances.
By what Italian streams.
Alas! for that accursed time
They bore thee o’er the billow.
From Love to titled age and crime,
And an unholy pillow—
From me, and from our misty clime.
Where weeps the silver willow !
</p><p>That these lines were written in English—a language with
<lb/>which I had not believed their author acquainted—afforded me
<lb/>little matter for surprise. I was too well aware of the extent
<lb/>of his acquirements, and of the singular pleasure he took in
<lb/>concealing them from observation, to be astonished at any sim-
<lb break="no"/>ilar discovery ; but the place of date, I must confess, occasion-
<lb break="no"/>ed me no little amazement. It had been originally written
<lb/>London, and afterwards carefully overscored—not, however,
<lb/>so effectually as to conceal the word from a scrutinizing eye.
<lb/>I say this occasioned me no little amazement; for I well re-
<lb break="no"/>member that, in a former conversation with my friend, I par-
<lb break="no"/>ticularly inquired if he had at any time met in London the
<lb/>Marchesa di Mentoni, (who for some years previous to her</p><p><pb n="360"/>
</p><p>marriage had resided in that city,) when his answer, if I mis-
<lb break="no"/>take not, gave me to understand that he had never visited the
<lb/>metropolis of Great Britain. I might as well here mention,
<lb/>that I have more than once heard, (without of course giving
<lb/>credit to a report involving so many improbabilities,) that the
<lb/>person of whom I speak was not only by birth, but in educa-
<lb break="no"/>tion, an Englishman.</p><p>* * * * * *
</p><p>“ There is one painting,” said he, without being aware of my
<lb/>notice of the tragedy—“ there is still one painting which you
<lb/>have not seen.” And throwing aside a drapery, he discovered
<lb/>a full length portrait of the Marchesa Aphrodite.</p><p></p><p>Human art could have done no more in the delineation of
<lb/>her superhuman beauty. The same ethereal figure which
<lb/>stood before me the preceding night upon the steps of the Du-
<lb break="no"/>cal Palace, stood before me once again. But in the expres-
<lb break="no"/>sion of the countenance, which was beaming all over with
<lb/>smiles, there still lurked (incomprehensible anomaly !) that fit-
<lb break="no"/>ful stain of melancholy which will ever be found inseparable
<lb/>from the perfection of the beautiful. Her right arm lay fold-
<lb break="no"/>ed over her bosom. With her left she pointed downward to a
<lb/>curiously fashioned vase. One small, fairy foot, alone visible,
<lb/>barely touched the earth—and, scarcely discernible in the bril-
<lb break="no"/>liant atmosphere which seemed to encircle and enshrine her
<lb/>loveliness, floated a pair of the most delicately imagined wings.
<lb/>My glance fell from the painting to the figure of my friend,
<lb/>and the vigorous words of Chapman’s Bussy D'Ambois quiver-
<lb break="no"/>ed instinctively upon my lips :</p><p>“ He is up
There like a Roman statue ! He will stand
Till Death hath made him marble!”
</p><p>“ Come !” he said at length, turning towards a table of richly
<lb/>enamelled and massive silver, upon which were a few goblets
<lb/>fantastically stained, together with two large Etruscan vases,
<lb/>fashioned in the same extraordinary model as that in the fore-
<lb break="no"/>ground of the portrait, and filled with what I supposed to be Jo-
<lb break="no"/>hannisberger. “ Come!” he said abruptly, “ let us drink ! It
<lb/>is early—but let us drink. It is indeed early,” he continued,
<lb/>musingly, as a cherub with a heavy golden hammer, made the
<lb/>apartment ring with the first hour after sunrise—“ It is indeed
<lb/>early, but what matters it ? let us drink ! Let us pour out an
<lb/>offering to yon solemn sun which these gaudy lamps and cen-
<lb break="no"/>sers are so eager to subdue !” And, having made me pledge
<lb/>him in a bumper, he swallowed in rapid succession several gob-
<lb break="no"/>lets of the wine.</p><p></p><p>“ To dream,” he continued, resuming the tone of his desul-
<lb break="no"/>tory conversation, as he held up to the rich light of a censer
<lb/>one of the magnificent vases—“ to dream has been the busi-
<lb break="no"/>ness of my life. I have therefore framed for myself, as you
<lb/>see, a bower of dreams. In the heart of Venice could I have
<lb/>erected a better? You behold around you, it is trite, a med-
<lb break="no"/>ley of architectural embellishments. The chastity of Ionia is
<lb/>offended by antediluvian devices, and the sphynxes of Egypt
<lb/>are outstretched upon carpets of gold. Yet the effect is in-
<lb break="no"/>congruous to the timid alone. Proprieties of place, and especi-
<lb break="no"/>ally of time, are the bugbears which terrify mankind from the
<lb/>contemplation of the magnificent. Once I was myself a deco-
<lb break="no"/>rist: but that sublimation of folly has palled upon my soul. All
<lb/>this is now the fitter for ray purpose. Like these arabesque
<lb/>censers, my spirit is writhing in fire, and the delirium of this
<lb/>scene is fashioning me for the wilder visions of that land of
<lb/>real dreams whither I am now rapidly departing.” He here
<lb/>paused abruptly, bent his head to his bosom, and seemed to
<lb/>listen to a sound which I could not hear. At length, erecting
<lb/>his frame, he looked upwards and ejaculated the lines of the
<lb/>Bishop of Chichester :—</p><p>Slay for me there !	I will not fail
To meet thee in that hollow vale.
In the next instant, confessing the power of the wine, he
threw himself at full length upon an ottoman.
</p><p>A quick step was now heard upon the staircase, and a loud
<lb/>knock at the door rapidly succeeded. I was hastening to an-
<lb break="no"/>ticipate a second disturbance, when a page of Mentoni’s house-
<lb break="no"/>hold burst into the room, and faltered out, in a voice choking
<lb/>with emotion, the incoherent words, “ My mistress !—my mis-
<lb break="no"/>tress !—poisoned!—poisoned! Oh beautiful—oh beautiful Aph-
<lb break="no"/>rodite !”</p><p></p><p>Bewildered, I flew to the ottoman, and endeavored to arouse
<lb/>the sleeper to a sense of the startling intelligence. But his
<lb/>limbs were rigid—his lips were livid—his lately beaming eyes
<lb/>were riveted in death. I staggered back towards the table—</p><p></p><p>my hand fell upon a cracked and blackened goblet—and a con-
<lb break="no"/>sciousness of the entire and terrible truth flashed suddenly over
<lb/>my soul.</p><p>EDGAR A. POE.
Original Poetry.
SONG OF THE FLOWERS TO THE SUNBEAM.
Thou slender ray of finest gold,
Thridding the dusky sky,
Thou leapest from thy burnished fold,
And, all in morning garments stol’d,
Earth-ward dost fly.
Thou toilest through the live-long day,
Feeding the hungry flowers,
Our little lids we open lay,
Our little lips unclose to say—
“ All thine is ours.”
</p><p>For fast within thy heart are braided
<lb/>By the dear Father’s hand
<lb/>The seven-fold colors softly shaded,</p><p>That melting blend, pure and unfaded,
Throughout the band.
And, while thou tendest us with care,
We ever strive to win,
Of all thy hues, some little share,
Or choosing one that seems most fair,
Stand clothed therein.
Our sister violet lowly crowned—
She stealeth but one hue,
She lieth hidden on the ground,
And hath more need to spread around
Her sky of blue.
Within her heart-shaped leaves, the rose
Garners thy nectar up,
And when thou biddest her unclose,
Red morning clouds spread forth their shows
Within her cup.
To thousand little flowers that spring
Amid the grass so green.
Rich yellow raiment thou dost bring,
That they within the grass may fling
A sunny sheen.
But the great lily, high apart,
Loves all thy colors bright,
And weaves them in with thine own art,
Until her patient, glorious heart
Stands rob’d in white.
O ray, the Sun, thy burnished fold,
Moveth adown the steep,
Farewell, now spread the shadows cold,
Forth from the eastern sky unroll'd,
And we must sleep.
MARIA LOWELL.
ASTARTE.
Thy lustre, heavenly star, shines ever on me!
</p><p>I, trembling, like Endymion over-bent
<lb/>By dazzling Dian, when, with wonderment
<lb/>He saw her crescent light the Latmian lea;</p><p>And, like a Naiad's sailing on the sea,
Floats thy fair form before me—the azure air
Is all ambrosial with thy hyacinth hair;
While round thy lips, the moth, in airy glee
Hovers, and hums in dim and dizzy dreams—
Drunken with odorous breath—thy argent eyes,
Twin planets, swimming through love’s lustrous skies,
Are mirror'd in my heart's serenest streams.
Such eyes saw Shakespeare—flashing, bold and bright,
When queenly Egypt rode the Nile at night.

Fleetwood, or The Stain op Birth. A Novel of American Life.
By the Author of Philip in Search of a Wife, &amp;c., &amp;c. New York.
Burgess, Stringer &amp; Co. 1845.
</p><p>A novel of American life is one of the greatest novelties in
<lb/>literature ; and we took up “ Fleetwood,” therefore, with pe-
<lb break="no"/>culiar pleasure, anticipating, from its winning title, an unusual
<lb/>treat. Novels of Irish life, Scotch life, Cockney life, French
<lb/>life, and even of Swedish and Russian life, are as plenty as
<lb/>blackberries, in our booksellers’ shops. But hitherto, no-
<lb break="no"/>body but Mr. Dickens and Mrs. Trollope, has made an at-
<lb break="no"/>tempt at American life. It certainly speaks little for the
<lb/>imagination of our twenty millions, that not one among
<lb/>them has been found capable of giving a sketch of their char-
<lb break="no"/>acters. We have not produced a single book which can be
<lb/>pointed to as containing an insight into the peculiarities of the
<lb/>national character. Mrs. Clavers has made the most success-
<lb break="no"/>ful attempt, but her sketches are confined to a very limited cir-
<lb break="no"/>cle of characters. Very perfect, they are, as far as they
<lb/>reach ; but our American novelist is yet in embryo, and in embryo
<lb/>must remain, until an international copy-right law shall enable
<lb/>the genius of the nation to develope itself. The author of the
<lb/>book before us, says in his preface, which he calls an “ over-
<lb break="no"/>ture,” that twenty thousand copies of his last work were sold ;
<lb/>a much greater number we fear, than were read, for we do not
<lb/>remember to have heard it named or to have seen it alluded to,
<lb/>by any of our critics or reviews. Twenty thousand copies are
<lb/>a monstrous edition for a novel, much larger than any of Wal-
<lb break="no"/>ter Scott’s ever reached, and probably four times greater than
<lb/>either of Bulwer’s or James’ novels has ever amounted to in
<lb/>their best days. Cheap reading, we mistrust, produces cheap
<lb/>readers. A great majority of the books published at the pre-
<lb break="no"/>sent day, novels in particular, are pure luxuries, and a luxury
<lb/>to be held in any esteem must not come too cheap. If novels
<lb/>and truffles were given away, we doubt whether half the quan-
<lb break="no"/>tity of either would be devoured, that there is at present. Au-
<lb break="no"/>thors and booksellers made a terrible mistake when they in-
<lb break="no"/>troduced the cheap system. Nothing has saved the present
<lb/>race of English novelists from utter oblivion, but publishing in
<lb/>three volumes at a guinea and a half. A book needs the en-
<lb break="no"/>dorsement of a review to give it a circulating value, but who
<lb/>will waste time in reviewing a work which is shabbily printed
<lb/>and sold for a shilling ? Mr. Cooper has lost half his popular-
<lb break="no"/>ity at home, since he reduced the price of his novels; but
<lb/>abroad where the old price is adhered to, he meets with the
<lb/>same dignified reception that he ever did. Whether such a
<lb/>book as Fleetwood would meet with a more profitable sale if
<lb/>the prices were greater we have doubts, but if the uniform
<lb/>price of novels were greater, we should have no Fleetwoods at
<lb/>all, but in their place works of a much higher order of merit.</p><p></p><p>The sub-titles of Fleetwood are both misnomers ; first there
<lb/>is no character in it to whom the stain of birth is fixed, and se-
<lb break="no"/>condly it contains no American life, nor any other life indeed,
<lb/>although it contains several American names. The first chap-
<lb break="no"/>ter of the work affords a fair specimen of the author’s style,
<lb/>which is stiff and pompous,—inflated without being light, and
<lb/>dreadfully hard without any force;—it begins in this abrupt and
<lb/>grandiloquent style:</p><p></p><p>“ Midnight brought with it no abatement of the violence of
<lb/>the gale. During the day it had swept in eddying gusts
<lb/>through the broad avenues and narrow cross streets of the city,
<lb/>carrying desolation and dismay—prostrating chimneys—scat-
<lb break="no"/>tering the slates from the roofs, and making sad havoc with
<lb/>the wooden signs which adorned the districts devoted to traffic.
<lb/>One man, as he was passing up Broadway, had been knocked
<lb/>on the head by the shaft of a canvass awning, and instantly</p><p></p><p>killed. Others had been severely bruised by the flying frag-
<lb break="no"/>ments, strewn at random by the blast. The dwellers on the
<lb/>North River had been appalled by the lurid aspect and the
<lb/>rapid swelling of that majestic stream. Its tortured waters
<lb/>would writhe and convolve into large ridges of foam, as if a
<lb/>new ocean were struggling for birth beneath its laboring sur-
<lb break="no"/>face, &amp;c., &amp;c.” Much more of similar description follows,
<lb/>which the reader will naturally suppose has something to do
<lb/>with the story, but it hasn’t. The man knocked on the head
<lb/>by the shaft of a canvass awning and instantly killed, as he
<lb/>was going up Broadway, is a touch of “ American life,” and
<lb/>should be a caution to our citizens to get into an omnibus when
<lb/>wooden signs, slates and chimneys are “ strewn at random by
<lb/>the blast.” “ The dwellers on the North River ” and the
<lb/>“ shaft of a canvass awning,” are objects of which we have no
<lb/>very clear idea, although we are tolerably familiar with the ri-
<lb break="no"/>ver and with awnings.</p><p></p><p>In the midst of this tremendous storm, the door of a house
<lb/>opens, “ a young man might have been seen,”—he must have
<lb/>been seen, or the fact could not have been chronicled—“ to is-
<lb break="no"/>sue forth unattended.” Though young women do not often
<lb/>issue forth unattended in stormy nights, it is a very common
<lb/>occurrence with young men ; and we do not, therefore, see
<lb/>the necessity of noticing the fact. The young man after he
<lb/>has issued forth, holds this remarkable conversation with some-
<lb break="no"/>body who had lighted him to the door :</p><p>“ You had better stay, Challoner. It is a dreadful night.
Gome back.”
“ No, I thank you, Winton. I shall get along very well.
Good night.”
</p><p>What does the reader suppose that this young man, who had
<lb/>issued forth unattended at midnight, did in the midst of a pelt-
<lb break="no"/>ing snow storm, when chimneys were flying about at random,
<lb/>and the waters of the North River wore convolving themselves
<lb/>into lurid aspects and so forth ? We will let the author answer.</p><p></p><p>“ No sooner had the door closed upon him than he threw his
<lb/>cloak over his arm, took off his hat, tore open his vest, and
<lb/>stood with his face to the blast, as if its snow-laden currents
<lb/>were hardly strong and chilly enough to cool the fever of his
<lb/>brain. His person bared to the storm, he walked slowly on
<lb/>like one immersed in thought.” Now to our thinking he act-
<lb break="no"/>ed much more like one immersed in liquor than thought.</p><p></p><p>This gentleman had just left a gambling house, where he
<lb/>had lost all his money, and having a young wife at home whose
<lb/>destitution he commiserates, he coolly stops at the door of a
<lb/>courtesan and requests the trifling loan of a hundred dollars of
<lb/>the bawd who keeps the house. His request is politely compli-
<lb break="no"/>ed with, but before he reaches his own house, “ as he was turning
<lb/>the corner of a well known street, (there are several in New
<lb/>York) a chimney was hurled into fragments by the blast. The
<lb/>scattered debris struck him violently on the head and felled
<lb/>him to the earth.” Debris is, we suppose, a new name for
<lb/>bricks, we know of no other material of which chimneys are
<lb/>composed. “ The storm howled on, and spread its flaky wind-
<lb break="no"/>ing sheet over his body; and there he was found under the
<lb/>incarnadined snow, a ghastly spectacle, by the early morning
<lb/>light.”</p><p></p><p>This is the last of the chapter and the last of the unfortu-
<lb break="no"/>nate gentleman ; we hear of him no more until the book is clos-
<lb break="no"/>ing. The next chapter begins with a conversation between
<lb/>“ two young men equipped for a shooting excursion,” seven-
<lb break="no"/>teen years after the “ tragical event which we have narrat-
<lb break="no"/>ed.” The scene is in Connecticut near the Sound ; the two
<lb/>young men are the heroes of the novel, very intimate friends,
<lb/>who appear afterwards to have had not the slightest regard for
<lb/>each other. As they stand conversing after the manner of Amer-</p><p><pb n="362" break="no" />
</p><p>ican high life, they see a young female on the brow of a small 
<lb/>sandy acclivity in the act of falling from a spirited horse, 
<lb/>Fleetwood, the man-angel of the story, “ darted to her relief
<lb/>and caught her in his arms, while her horse in his fright, was
<lb/>twisting round like—” Like what ? We would bet a trifle
<lb/>that no reader, though ever so familiar with horses, could ever
<lb/>guess,—“ like water as it leaves a tunnel." This young lady
<lb/>is the woman-angel of course, with “chiselled loveliness of
<lb/>features,” not to be described; and “ long eye-lashes that cur- 
<lb/>tained dark blue balls.” He and she fall in love without the
<lb/>slightest hesitation, as a matter of course; the merest tyro in
<lb/>novel-reading could tell that. But we regret for “Ameri-
<lb break="no"/>can life,” that Mr. Fleetwood was guilty of an act which not only
<lb/>proves him to be either an ass or a villain, but also lets us into the
<lb/>secret of the author’s estimation of a gentleman and of his ex-
<lb break="no"/>perience of “ American life.” While the young lady rests in
<lb/>a fainting condition in his arms, he has the meanness, which
<lb/>no butcher’s boy would be guilty of, to kiss her lips and her
<lb/>cheek ; and when Glenham, his companion, interrupts him, he
<lb/>requests that American gentleman to run and call a physician,
<lb/>to which Mr. Glenham replies, “ using a school boy’s collo-
<lb break="no"/>quial vulgarism,” as the author elegantly expresses it, “ in 
<lb/>what part of my eye do you see anything green ?”</p><p></p><p>Fleetwood is a young gentleman of very large fortune with- 
<lb/>out a relative in the world, although he is a descendant of the
<lb/>royal families of England and France, all his relations having
<lb/>been blown up in steamboats or lost at sea. His father had
<lb/>enjoined upon him never to marry a woman of inferior birth to 
<lb/>himself; but Adelaide, the heroine, proves to be the offspring 
<lb/>of a left-handed connexion ; in fact her mother was the keeper
<lb/>of the very brothel from whom the unfortunate gentleman, who
<lb/>was killed by the debris of a chimney, borrowed a hundred dol-
<lb break="no"/>lars in the first chapter. What of that ? Love is not only ,
<lb/>blind, but an unprincipled vagabond, and Fleetwood, under his
<lb/>directions, pays not the slightest regard to his father's injunc-
<lb break="no"/>tions, but proposes to marry Adelaide, who agrees to marry 
<lb/>him, after fifteen minutes’ acquaintance. The young lady’s
<lb/>mother, however, puts a stop to the match by taking her
<lb/>daughter back to New York, with an intention of putting her
<lb/>upon the stage ; her extremely modest and shrinking manners
<lb/>rendering her a capital subject for the display of the theatre. 
<lb/>Augusta, the mother of the young lady, who still keeps up her
<lb/>establishment, in a “ well-known street,” forms a league with
<lb/>Mr. Gordon, a rich merchant, Glenham, Fleetwood’s friend,
<lb/>and Count La Salle, a French gentleman, to prevent Fleet-
<lb break="no"/>wood from marrying Adelaide, and to carry their purpose, they
<lb/>resort to practices which we trust no three individuals could
<lb/>be found in the world base enough to undertake. But quite as
<lb/>a matter of course they don’t succeed. Adelaide turns out to
<lb/>be the lawful daughter of the debris-killed gentleman and the
<lb/>heiress of a large fortune, which she bequeaths to Fleetwood
<lb/>and dies; he gives the money to the greatest rogue in the
<lb/>book and goes a travelling, and the book is at an end. But a
<lb/>letter from Mrs. Davenant in Paris to her friend in New York,
<lb/>intimates that there is probability of a match being made be-
<lb break="no"/>tween Fanny Ellsler the younger, a Park Theatre figurante,
<lb/>whom Adelaide took under her protection before she died, and
<lb/>Fleetwood, who has been travelling in the East.</p><p></p><p>“ Fleetwood ” is probably quite as good a book as many of
<lb/>those that issue from our press and are eagerly read by the
<lb/>young and thoughtless, doing them no more harm than any
<lb/>other merely idle employment, and we should not have select- 
<lb/>ed it from a mass of flimsy things for an extended notice, had
<lb/>not the presumption of the author, in putting “a Novel of
<lb/>American life ” in the title page, arrested our attention. Amer-
<lb break="no"/>ican life is human life, and the author who aims to represent </p><p></p><p>American men and women, must bear in mind the importance
<lb/>of making them appear like human beings, if he would have
<lb/>them pass current with the rest of the world.</p><p>NEW WORKS LATELY RECEIVED,

Would bend them cheerful from th’ indulgent skies,
And bless, as we do now, this hallowed day,
Which saw them given to God, by faith, away.
Nor few the living men bound by this bond,
Who, ask'd, would not with grateful heart respond—
They brought me here before my heart could ken
Or good, or evil, or what did they then;
The crystal waters laved my infant brow,
And thus began my Christian life below :
My mother gave me, when my heart was young,
The picture which concludes this moral song;
I’ve lived to comprehend and bless the Power
That sealed me His, in life's first budding hour.
Thus, as the world grows old, may men grow wise,
And mount, in goodness, nearer to the skies."

MAGAZINES AND REVIEWS.
</p><p>The Democratic Review for June, is illustrated by a por-
<lb break="no"/>trait of M. B. Lamar, of Texas. It contains a long poem by
<lb/>Whittier; a spirited paper on Oregon, by D. D. Field; a pecu-
<lb break="no"/>liarly unintelligible essay on Emerson, by a “ Disciple an
<lb/>article by J. T. Headly, and a very pleasant collection of
<lb/>miscellanies, besides reviews and critical notices.</p><p></p><p>Hunt’s Magazine, has its usual variety of excellent papers
<lb/>on commerce and political economy, and an able article on the
<lb/>commercial associations of France and England, by Henry C.
<lb/>Cary, of Philadelphia.</p><p></p><p>The American Review contains two articles of unusual
<lb/>force for a magazine ; the “ Mystery of Iniquity,” contin-
<lb break="no"/>ued from the last number, by Dr. Bacon, and an essay on
<lb/>American Letters, by Mr. Johnson, the author, we believe,
<lb/>of the literary notices in the National Intelligencer. The es-
<lb break="no"/>say is written with vigor and, to a very great extent, with dis-
<lb break="no"/>crimination ; but the writer betrays an inexcusable ignorance</p><p><pb n="364"/>
</p><p>of his subject, or a very reprehensible prejudice against Amer-
<lb break="no"/>ican authors. As a specimen of his feeling for poetry, we
<lb/>quote his concluding paragraph.</p><p></p><p>“ Still there is some comfort. Verse is daily getting into
<lb/>disrepute, which delights me. There is nothing of which a
<lb/>London or New York bookseller is so shy. Shortly we trust
<lb/>to see it abandoned to tailors and man-milliners, as congenial
<lb/>to their pursuits alone, and employed to popularize, as it is al-
<lb break="no"/>ready adequately doing, patent blacking, hoarhound candy and 
<lb/>quack medicines. They who rhyme upon these subjects give 
<lb/>us hopes, for they are the only ones we see who are equal to 
<lb/>their subjects.”</p><p></p><p>This is decidedly cool, considering that the editor of the Re- 
<lb/>view is himself the author of the longest American poem which 
<lb/>has been published. The new Johnson has something of the 
<lb/>imperative manner of his great namesake. He is evidently
<lb/>not a person to spoil a joke for relation sake. Ne sutor ultra
<lb/>crepidam, however. We regret, for the Review's sake, that
<lb/>so absurd an article has been admitted into its columns.</p><p>THE FINE ARTS.
</p><p>Another glorious landscape by George Brown has been ad- 
<lb/>ded to the exhibition-room of the American Art-Union. It
<lb/>represents a view on the Arno, near Florence, with the tower 
<lb/>of Michael Angelo in the fore-ground, and the city in the dis- 
<lb/>tance. It is in the style of the four other pictures by the same
<lb/>artist, which we have already noticed, and equals either of them 
<lb/>in execution. As these masterly paintings belong to private 
<lb/>houses, the public should not miss the opportunity of inspect- 
<lb/>ing them while they remain in their present place of exhibi-
<lb break="no"/>tion.</p><p></p><p>New York Paintings in London,—The exhibition of the
<lb/>Royal Academy in London, contains portraits by Ingham and
<lb/>Inman, landscapes by Durand &amp; Cropsey, and a composition 
<lb/>by F. W. Edmonds. The latter gentleman has been elected
<lb/>an honorary member of the Royal Academy. The exhibition
<lb/>also contains a portrait by Healy, another American artist,
<lb/>though not a New-Yorker.</p><p>MUSICAL ITEMS.
</p><p>The New Opera at Philadelphia.—We shall present to our
<lb/>readers next week a faithful account and impartial criticism of
<lb/>Leonora, written and composed by the Messrs. Fry. It being the
<lb/>first Opera written by an American, there is very naturally a con-
<lb break="no"/>siderable degree of excitement and interest respecting it. We
<lb/>are curious to witness the impression made by its first perform-
<lb break="no"/>ance, and have therefore made arrangements to proceed to Phila-
<lb break="no"/>delphia, in order to be present on Wednesday evening. We trust,
<lb/>for the sake of “ Young America,” that we may be enabled to give
<lb/>a favorable report of the joint work of the two brothers. But, be
<lb/>that as it may, no one can dispute their claim to much merit and
<lb/>boldness as the pioneers on a way hitherto untravelled.</p><p></p><p>Among the young men both in this city and in Philadelphia,
<lb/>there is a vast amount of genius and perseverance, and to their
<lb/>exertions will music owe its elevation in this country.</p><p></p><p>But, while extolling the “ young men,” we would on no account
<lb/>disparage the "old ones.” There are many whose large practical
<lb/>and theoretical knowledge, if rightly exerted, would give an im-
<lb break="no"/>pulse to music hitherto unknown; but they wrap themselves about
<lb/>with their age and their dignity, and, like the snail, keep them-
<lb break="no"/>selves to themselves, and retire into houses which they seem ever
<lb/>to carry on their backs, lest the young men should tread upon their
<lb/>heels.</p><p>We have thought much upon this subject, and intend very
shortly to discuss it at length, for it is a theme rife with interest,
and offers matter for deep consideration to all those interested in
the progress of musical art in the New World.
</p><p>Concert at the Coliseum.—Mrs. Strong, Miss Pearson, Mr. Comes
<lb/>and Mr. Pearson, Sen., have formed themselves into an association
<lb/>for the purpose of giving Glee Concerts. The first one took place
<lb/>at the above Rooms on Tuesday last; the selection was attractive,
<lb/>consisting of some extremely beautiful glees, and some very popu-
<lb break="no"/>lar melodies, harmonized Mrs. Strong's talent is well known to
<lb/>the largest portion of the musical public; she is deservedly a great
<lb/>favorite. The Concert was well attended, and the performance
<lb/>was highly creditable. Mr. H. C. Timm presided at the pianoforte.</p><p>FOREIGN MUSICAL ITEMS.

<lb/>of the first order, has made her debut in London with great suc-
<lb break="no"/>sess. It is said, that the astonishing vigor, facility, and precision
<lb/>of Mdlle. Themar’s execution, combined with the expression and
<lb/>finish of her performance, much of which is of her own composi-
<lb break="no"/>tion, gave great satisfaction to the distinguished party, and justify
<lb/>the expectation that she will prove a star of no small magnitude,
<lb/>amidst the variety of musical talent at present collected in that

THE GRAVE OF L. E. L.
</p><p>The following graphic description of the burial place of Miss
<lb/>Landon, for the world will never call her Mrs. McLean, is ex-
<lb break="no"/>tracted from the journal of an African cruiser, kept by an offi-
<lb break="no"/>cer of our navy, and re written by Nathaniel Hawthorne. The
<lb/>“ Journal ” will be published by Wiley &amp; Putnam, and will
<lb/>form the leading volume of their new series of “ books which
<lb/>are books,” by American authors. The “ African Cruiser,” it
<lb/>appears is satisfied that the death of Mrs. McLean was purely
<lb/>accidental; but it is strange that no pains have ever been taken by
<lb/>her husband to put the world in possession of the facts relating
<lb/>to her sudden decease, and thus to silence the many vague ru-
<lb break="no"/>mors that have been circulated in England and America, since
<lb/>the occurrence of that unhappy event. Mrs. McLean is said
<lb/>to have been strongly attached to her husband, but it is hard to
<lb/>believe that the author of the Golden Violet could have felt
<lb/>any sympathy for a person of his mental and personal quali-
<lb break="no"/>ties. A person less likely than Captain McLean, to excite
<lb/>the admiration of an imaginative woman could hardly be
<lb/>conceived.</p><p>May 2.—Sailed for Cape Coast Castle with the evening breeze.
3.—At Cape Coast Castle.
</p><p>The landing is effected in large canoes, which couvey passengers
<lb/>close to the rocks, safely, and without being drenched, although
<lb/>the surf dashes fifty feet in height. There is a peculiar enjoyment
<lb/>in being raised, by an irresistible power beneath you, upon the
<lb/>tops of the high rollers, and then dropped into the profound hollow
<lb/>of the waves, as if to visit the bottom of the ocean, at whatever
<lb/>depth it might be. We landed at the castle-gate, and were usher-
<lb break="no"/>ed into the castle itself, where the commander of the troops re-
<lb break="no"/>ceived us in his apartment.</p><p></p><p>I took the first opportunity to steal away, to look at the burial-
<lb break="no"/>place of L. E. L., who died here, after a residence of only two
<lb/>months, and within a year after becoming the wife of Governor
<lb/>McLean. A small, white marble tablet (inserted among the
<lb/>massive grey stones of the castle-wall, where it faces the area of
<lb/>the fort) Dears the following inscription :</p><p></p><p>Hic jacet sepultum
<lb/>Omne quod mortale fuit
<lb/>Letitiae Elisabethae McLean,</p><p>Quam, egregia ornatam idole,
Musis unice amatam,
Omniumque amores secum trahentem,
In ipso aetatis flore,
Mors immature rapuit,
Die Octobris xv., A.D. mdcccxxxviii,
AEtat. 36.
Quod spectas, viator, marmor,
Vanum heu ! doloris monumentum,
Conjux moerens erexit.
</p><p>The first thought that struck me was the inappropriateness of
<lb/>the spot for a grave, and especially for the grave of a woman,
<lb/>and, most of all, a woman of poetic temperament. In the open
<lb/>area of the fort, at some distance from the castle-wall, the stone
<lb/>pavement had been removed in several spots, and re-placed with
<lb/>plain tiles. Here lie buried some of the many British officers who
<lb/>have fallen victims to the deadly atmosphere of this region; and
<lb/>among them rests L. E. L. Her grave is distinguishable by the
<lb/>ten red tiles which cover it. Daily, the tropic sunshine blazes
<lb/>down upon the spot. Daily, at the hour of parade, the peal of
<lb/>military music resounds above her head, and the garrison marches
<lb/>and counter-marches through the area of the fortress, nor shuns to
<lb/>tread upon the ten red tiles, any more than upon the insensible
<lb/>stones of the pavement. It may be well for the fallen commander
<lb/>to be buried at his post, and sleep where the reveille and roll-call
<lb/>may be heard, and the tramp of his fellow-soldiers echo and re-
<lb break="no"/>echo over him. All this is in unison with his profession; and the
<lb/>drum and trumpet are his perpetual requiem ; the soldier's honor-
<lb break="no"/>able tread leaves no indignity upon the dead warrior’s dust. But
<lb/>who has a right to trample on a woman's breast! And what had
<lb/>L. E. L. to do with warlike parade ? And wherefore was she
<lb/>buried beneath this scorching pavement, and not in the retired
<lb/>shadow of a garden, where seldom any footstep would come steal-
<lb break="no"/>ing through the grass, and pause before her tablet t There, her
<lb/>heart, while in one sense it decayed, would burst forth afresh from
<lb/>the sod in a profusion of spontaneous flowers, such as her living
<lb/>fancy lavished throughout the world. But now, no verdure Dor
<lb/>blossom will ever grow upon her grave.</p><p>If a man may ever indulge in sentiment, it is over the ashes of a
woman whose poetry touched him in his early youth, while he
</p><p>yet cared anything about either sentiment or poetry. Thus much,
<lb/>the reader will pardon. In reference to Mrs. McLean, it may be
<lb/>added, that, subsequently to her unhappy death, different rumors
<lb/>were afloat as to its cause, some of them cruel to her own memory,
<lb/>others to the conduct of her husband. All these reports appear to
<lb/>have been equally and entirely unfounded. It is well established
<lb/>here, that her death was accidental.</p><p>A PERFECT LADY.
</p><p>We take the following charming portrait of a very perfect
<lb/>woman from the last number of Coleman’s European Agricul-
<lb break="no"/>tural Tour; we know the author to be a very honest unimagin-
<lb break="no"/>ative person, or we should half suspect that he had been indebted
<lb/>to his fancy for a sitter, but he assures us that he only describes
<lb/>what he saw. We once heard Mr. Colman apologise to some
<lb/>ladies for using the term manure in their hearing, when con-
<lb break="no"/>versing upon agricultural topics, but his beau ideal lady appears
<lb/>to have been afflicted with none of the squeamishness common
<lb/>among American women.</p><p></p><p>I had no sooner entered the house, where my visit had been ex-
<lb break="no"/>pected, than I was met with an unaffected cordiality which at once
<lb/>made me at home. In the midst of gilded balls, and hosts of liver-
<lb break="no"/>ied servants, of dazzling lamps, and glittering mirrors, redoubling
<lb/>the highest triumphs of art and taste ; in the midst of books, and
<lb/>statues, and all the elegances and refinements of luxury ; in the
<lb/>midst of titles, and dignities, and ranks, allied to regal grandeur—
<lb/>there was one object which transcended and eclipsed them all,
<lb/>and showed how much the nobility of character surpassed the no-
<lb break="no"/>bility of rank, the beauty of refined and simple manners all the
<lb/>adornments of art and the scintillations of the soul, beaming from
<lb/>the eyes, the purest gems that ever glittered in a princely diadem.
<lb/>In person, in education and improvement, in quickness of percep-
<lb break="no"/>tion, in facility and elegance of expression, in accomplishments and
<lb/>taste, in a frankness and gentleness of manners tempered by a mo-
<lb break="no"/>desty which courted confidence and inspired respect, and in a high
<lb/>moral tone and sentiment, which, like a bright halo, seemed to en-
<lb break="no"/>circle the whole person,—I confess the fictions of poetry became
<lb/>substantial, and the beau ideal of my youthful imagination was
<lb/>realized.</p><p></p><p>But who was the person I have described ? A mere statue, to
<lb/>adorn a gallery of sculpture ? a bird of paradise, to be kept in a
<lb/>glass case ? a mere doll, with painted cheeks, to be dressed and
<lb/>undressed with childish fondness ? a mere human toy, to languish
<lb/>over a romance, or to figure in a quadrille ? Far otherwise ; she
<lb/>was a woman in all the noble attributes which should dignify that
<lb/>name; a wife, a mother, a housekeeper, a farmer, a gardener, a
<lb/>dairy-woman, a kind neighbor, a benefactor to the poor, a Chris-
<lb break="no"/>tian woman, ‘ full of good works, and alms-deeds which she did.’</p><p></p><p>In the morning, I first met her at prayers ; for, to the honor of
<lb/>England, there is scarcely a family, among the hundreds whose
<lb/>hospitality I have shared, where the duties of the day are not pre-
<lb break="no"/>ceded by the services of family worship ; and the master and the
<lb/>servant, the parent and the child, the teacher and the taught, the
<lb/>friend and the stranger, come together to recognise and strengthen
<lb/>the sense of their common equality in the presence of their com-
<lb break="no"/>mon Father, and to acknowledge their equal dependence upon his
<lb/>care and mercy. She was then kind enough to tell me, after her
<lb/>morning arrangements, she claimed me for the day. She first
<lb/>showed me her children, whom, like the Roman mother, she
<lb/>deemed her brightest jewels, and arranged their studies and occu-
<lb break="no"/>pations for the day. She then took me two or three miles on foot
<lb/>to visit a sick neighbor, and, while performing this act of kindness,
<lb/>left me to visit some of the cottages upon the estate, whose inmates
<lb/>I found loud in the praises of her kindness and benefactions. Our
<lb/>next excursion was to see some of the finest, and largest, and most
<lb/> aged trees in the park, the size of which was truly magnificent;
<lb/>and I sympathized in the veneration which she expressed for them,
<lb/>which was like that with which one recalls the illustrious memory
<lb/> of a remote progenitor. Our next visit was to the greenhouses
<lb/>and the gardens; and she explained to me the mode adopted there
<lb/>of managing the most delicate plants, and of cultivating, in the
<lb/>most economical and successful manner, the fruits of a wanner
<lb/>region. From the garden we proceeded to the cultivated fields;
<lb/>and she informed me of the system of husbandry pursued on the
<lb/>estate, the rotation of crops, the management and application of
<lb/>manures, the amount of seed sown, the ordinary yield, and the
<lb/>appropriation of the produce, with a perspicuous detail of the ex-
<lb break="no"/>penses and results. She then undertook to show me the yards and
<lb/>offices, the byres, the feeding-stalls, the plans for saving, and in-
<lb break="no"/>creasing, and managing, the manure, the cattle for feeding, for
<lb/>breeding, for raising the milking stock, the piggery, the poultry-
<lb break="no"/>yard, the stables, the harness-rooms, the implement-rooms, the
<lb/>dairy. She explained to me the process of making the different
<lb/>kinds of cheese, and the general management of the milk, and the
<lb/>mode of feeding the stock; and then, conducting me into the</p><p><pb n="366"/>
</p><p>baliff’s house, she exhibited to me the Farm Journal, and the
<lb/>whole systematic mode of keeping the accounts and making the
<lb/>returns, with which she seemed as familiar as if they were the
<lb/>accounts of her own wardrobe. This did not finish our grand tour:
<lb/>for, on my return, she admitted me into her boudoir, and showed
<lb/>me the secrets of her own admirable housewifery, in the exact
<lb/>accounts which she kept of everything connected with the diary
<lb/>and the market, the table, the drawing-room, and the servants’ 
<lb/>hall. All this was done with a simplicity and frankness which
<lb/>showed an absence of all consciousness of any extraordinary merit :
<lb/>in her own deportment, and which evidently sprang solely from a
<lb/>kind desire to gratify a curiosity on my part, which, I hope, under
<lb/>such circumstances, was not unreasonable. A short hour after this
<lb/>brought us into another relation; for the dinner-bell summoned us,
<lb/>and this same lady was found presiding over a brilliant circle of
<lb/>the highest rank and fashion, with an ease, elegance, wit, intelli-
<lb break="no"/>gence, and good-humor, with a kind attention to every one’s wants, 
<lb/>and an unaffected concern for every one’s comfort, which would
<lb/>lead one to suppose that this was her only and her peculiar sphere.
<lb/>Now, I will not say how many mud-puddles we had waded
<lb/>through, and how many dung-heaps we had crossed, and what
<lb/>places we explored, and how every farming topic was discussed:
<lb/>but I will say, that she pursued her object without any of that
<lb/>fastidiousness and affected delicacy which pass with some persons
<lb/>for refinement, but which in many cases indicate a weak if not a
<lb/>corrupt mind. The mind which is occupied with concerns and
<lb/>subjects that are worthy to occupy it, thinks very little of accesso-
<lb break="no"/>ries which are of no importance. I will say, to the credit of Eng-
<lb break="no"/>lishwomen,—I speak, of course, of the upper classes, that it
<lb/>seems impossible that there should exist a more delicate sense of
<lb/>propriety than is found universally among them ; and yet you will
<lb/>perceive at once that their good sense teaches them that true
<lb/>delicacy is much more an element of the mind, in the person who
<lb/>speaks or observes, than an attribute of the subject which is spoken 
<lb/>about or observed.</p><p></p><p>Now, I do not say that the lady to whom I have referred was
<lb/>herself the manager of the farm; that rested entirely with her
<lb/>husband ; but I have intended simply to show how grateful and
<lb/>gratifying to him must have been the lively interest and sympathy
<lb/>which she took in concerns which necessarily so much engaged
<lb/>his time and attention; and how the country could be divested of 
<lb/>that dulness and ennui, so often complained of, as inseparable from
<lb/>it, when a cordial and practical interest is taken in the concerns
<lb/>which necessarily belong to rural life. I meant also to show—as
<lb/>this and many other examples which have come under my observa- 
<lb/>tion emphatically do show—that an interest in, and a familiarity
<lb/>with, even the most humble occupations of agricultural life, are
<lb/>not inconsistent with the highest refinements of taste, the most
<lb/>improved cultivation of the mind, and elegance, and dignity of
<lb/>manners, unsurpassed in the highest circles of society.</p><p>MISCELLANY.
</p><p>Castle Garden.—This well known and popular summer resort, 
<lb/>is, we are happy to say, in a fair way to return with interest the
<lb/>liberal outlay of the proprietors. The price of admission has been
<lb/>lowered to twenty five cents—a rate recommended by us from the 
<lb/>first—and the entertainments are of a character to please those
<lb/>persons most likely to visit the Garden, or rather Theatre. Sing-
<lb break="no"/>ing, dancing, rope-dancing and funny monopolologues till up the
<lb/>passing hours; to say nothing of the vast area for promenading and
<lb/>refreshment, with the lovely walk which surrounds the whole, in
<lb/>full view of the Bay.</p><p></p><p>There is one thing, however, which imperatively calls fur altera- 
<lb/>tion. We tried every portion of the gallery, and found that in no
<lb/>situation could we hear one word of Mr. Hilt’s humorous sketches.
<lb/>Ladies do not like being hustled by the crowd below, but prefer
<lb/>remaining, to their own loss, in their seats in the gallery. To en- 
<lb/>tertainments such as Mr. Hill presents us with, a stage should be
<lb/>erected in front of the Cupola, when every one in the house would
<lb/>be enabled to hear. This is the sole, though important, drawback
<lb/>to this extensive and attractive establishment.</p><p></p><p>The Italian singers will not be re-engaged, which we think very
<lb/>fortunate for the Proprietors. They were out of place there, and
<lb/>could not fail to take more from the treasury than they would bring
<lb/>into it.</p><p></p><p>Poor Hood is at last in “ port,” as he said of himself. He
<lb/>died on the 7th of last month and was buried in Kendal
<lb/>Green Cemetry, a much better place for his remains than the
<lb/>" corner” in Westminster Abbey.</p><p>LIST OF NEW BOOKS PUBLISHED IN ENGLAND.

HARPER’S ILLUMINATED AND ILLUSTRATED BIBLE,
Splendidly and profusely embellished with about 1600 ex-
</p><p>quisitely-finished illustrations by Adams, principally from original
<lb/>designs by Chapman ; to be completed in about 50 numbers, royal
<lb/>folio size, at 25 cents each, 28 of which are already published : the
<lb/>continuation at intervals of every 10 days till finished. This sump-
<lb break="no"/>tuous work, evincing a style of art unsurpassed by any edition of
<lb/>the Sacred Canon ever issued from the press, forms one of
<lb/>the most desirable and beautiful presents that can possibly
<lb/>be selected as a Sacred Token of Remembrance, and cer-
<lb break="no"/>tainly far more worthy the giver and receiver than the ephe-
<lb break="no"/>meral though gaudy works usually devoted to that purpose.
<lb/>For its extreme beauty of finish, and the richness and rarity
<lb/>of its embellishments, this volume, when complete, will far
<lb/>transcend anything of the kind extant. To render it universally 
<lb/>acceptable, the text is the authorized version, given without note
<lb/>or comment, so that no sectarian prejudice can exist against its un-
<lb break="no"/>limited circulation. By taking the work in numbers choice im-
<lb break="no"/>pressions of the plates will be secured, besides the well-known ad-
<lb break="no"/>vantages of economy in so costly a publication.</p><p>II.

EDITED BY GULIAN C. VERPLANCK, LL.D.
</p><p>The extreme elegance, vigor, and boldness of conception that
<lb/>characterise the exquisite designs which embellish this sumptu-
<lb break="no"/>ous edition of Shakspeare, impart to it great artistic value. Based
<lb/>as this American edition is upon the well known English edition of
<lb/>Knight and Tyas, embodying the best features of both, it cannot
<lb/>fail of rankiug first among the numerous splendid monuments of
<lb/>bibliographic art to the memory of the great “ monarch of the
<lb/>mind." To the lovers of the “legitimate drama,” as well as to
<lb/>the artist, this will prove a rich and luxurious book : and as early
<lb/>impressions possess a charm for such, their inspection of it is es-
<lb break="no"/>pecially solicited, now in the freshness of its first issue. The en-
<lb break="no"/>tire number of illustrations will amount to about 14,00! a fact of
<lb/>itself sufficient evidence of prodigal liberality on the part of the
<lb/>publishers.</p><p>IV.

</p><p>Mr. Rich Respectfully informs his friends and fellow-citizens that he
<lb/>has formed an establishment in Paris, in connexion with his old estab-
<lb break="no"/>lishment in Red Lion Square, for the purpose of furnishing BOOKS
<lb/>published on the continent without the heavy expense attending their
<lb/>transmission through England. Each of these establishments will be
<lb/>conducted by one of his sons, under his own general superintendence.—
<lb/>This new arrangement, he trusts, will prove of signal advantage to his
<lb/>correspondents, and no exertions will be wanting to execute their orders
<lb/>on the most advantageous terms. Orders may be sent through, and
<lb/>small sums payed to Messrs. Goodhue &amp; Co. of New-York. Two and a

<lb/>literature or science. For information in regard to his efficiency, he
<lb/>begs to refer to Messrs Prescott, Ticknor, Sparks, Irving, and other lit-

<lb/>to devote the remainder of his life to literary pursuits, his greatest plea-

<lb/>and he trusts to live long enough to see in the United States a Library
<lb/>which may bear a comparison with the most celebrated in Europe. If
<lb/>he can live to say, “ I also assisted in its formation,” his most ar-

BERTINI’S METHOD FOR THE PIANO.
THIS is the only thorough, complete and progressive
</p><p>work yet published iu this country. Where pupils have used this
<lb/>method, the most rapid advancement has been observed in all cases.
<lb/>The most prominent feature of this work is that the lessons, exercises,
<lb/>scales and studies are given in such progressive order, that they enlist
<lb/>the interests of pupils, and carry them almost imperceptibly through those
<lb/>mechanical difficulties which, otherwise, are too often made irksome in
<lb/>other instruction books. The time has arrived when a superficial know-
<lb break="no"/>ledge of the Piano is of but little account, and it is only by the study of
<lb/>such methods as Bertini’s that pupils will be enabled to read music
<lb/>with facility, and at the same time become good musicians.</p><p></p><p>This method commences in the most plain and simple manner; the
<lb/>rudiments of music being given and illustrated at the same time, and each
<lb/>lesson is fully explained by marginal notes on the same page.</p><p></p><p>The publishers are in possession of the highest recommendations from
<lb/>professional gentlemen, who speak of the superior merits of Bertini’s
<lb/>Method over all others yet published in this country, most of them
<lb/>having used the foreign copies previously. It will only be necessary to
<lb/>give a few of the names in the principal cities.</p><p>Boston.	New-York.
