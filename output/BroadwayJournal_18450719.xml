OUR NEW VOLUME.
</p><p>To the Public.—The suspension of “The Broadway
<lb/>Journal" for one week, has been occasioned by the necessity
<lb/>for some arrangements in which the public have no interest,
<lb/>but which, beyond doubt, will give increased value and
<lb/>efficiency to the paper.</p><p></p><p>In commencing the Second Volume, the undersigned begs
<lb/>leave to return his sincere thanks to the numerous friends 
<lb/>who have lent him their aid in the very difficult task of
<lb/>establishing a literary and critical weekly. The success of
<lb/>the work, in the brief period of its existence, has been, he
<lb/>truly believes, beyond precedent—and from a briliiant Past,
<lb/>he looks confidently to a triumphant Future.</p><p></p><p>The editorial conduct of “ The Broadway Journal” is un-
<lb break="no"/>der the sole charge of Edgar A. Poe—Mr. H. C. Watson,
<lb/>as heretofore, controlling the Musical Department.</p><p>John Bisco,
Publisher.
The Masque of the Red Death.
</p><p>The “Red Death” had long devastated the country. No
<lb/>pestilence had ever been so fatal, or so hideous. Blood was
<lb/>its Avator and its seal—the redness and the horror of blood.
<lb/>There were sharp pains, and sudden dizziness, and then pro-
<lb break="no"/>fuse bleeding at the pores, with dissolution. The scarlet
<lb/>stains upon the body and especially upon the face of the vic-
<lb break="no"/>tim, were the pest ban which shut him out from the aid and
<lb/>from the sympathy of his fellow-men. And the whole seiz- 
<lb/>ure, progress and termination of the disease, were the inci- 
<lb/>dents of half an hour.</p><p></p><p>But the Prince Prospero was happy and dauntless and sa- 
<lb/>gacious. When his dominions were half depopulated, he
<lb/>summoned to his presence a thousand hale and light-hearted
<lb/>friends from among the knights and dames of his court, and 
<lb/>with these retired to the deep seclusion of one of his castel-
<lb break="no"/>lated abbeys. This was an extensive and magnificent struc- 
<lb/>ture, the creation of the prince’s own eccentric yet august
<lb/>taste. A strong and lofty wall girdled it in. This wall had
<lb/>gates of iron. The courtiers, having entered, brought fur-
<lb break="no"/>naces and massy hammers and welded the bolts. They re-
<lb break="no"/>solved to leave means neither of ingress or egress to the sud-
<lb break="no"/>den impulses of despair or of frenzy from within. The abbey
<lb/>was amply provisioned. With such precautions the cour-
<lb break="no"/>tiers might bid defiance to contagion. The external world
<lb/>could take care of itself. In the meantime it was folly to
<lb/>grieve, or to think. The prince had provided all the appli-
<lb break="no"/>ances of pleasure. There were buffoons, there were impro-
<lb break="no"/>visatori, there were ballet-dancers, there were musicians,
<lb/>there was Beauty, there was wine. All these and security
<lb/>were within. Without was the “ Red Death.”</p><p></p><p>It was toward the close of the fifth or sixth month of his
<lb/>seclusion, and while the pestilence raged most furiously 
<lb/>abroad, that the Prince Prospero entertained his thousand </p><p>friends at a masked ball of the most unusual magnificence.
</p><p>It was a voluptuous scene, that masquerade. But first let
<lb/>me tell of the rooms in which it was held. There were
<lb/>seven—an imperial suite. In many palaces, however, such
<lb/>suites form a long and straight vista, while the folding doors
<lb/>slide back nearly to the walls on either hand, so that the
<lb/>view of the whole extent is scarcely impeded. Here the
<lb/>case was very different; as might have been expected from
<lb/>the duke’s love of the bizarre. The apartments were so ir-
<lb break="no"/>regularly disposed that the vision embraced but little more
<lb/>than one at a time. There was a sharp turn at every twen-
<lb break="no"/>ty or thirty yards, and at each turn a novel effect. To the
<lb/>right and left, in the middle of each wall, a tall and narrow
<lb/>Gothic window looked out upon a closed corridor which pur-
<lb break="no"/>sued the windings of the suite. These windows were of
<lb/>stained glass whose color varied in accordance with the pre-
<lb break="no"/>vailing hue of the decorations of the chamber into which it
<lb/>opened. That at the eastern extremity was hung, for exam-
<lb break="no"/>ample, in blue—and vividly blue were its windows. The
<lb/>second chamber was purple in its ornaments and tapestries,
<lb/>and here the panes were purple. The third was green
<lb/>throughout, and so were the casements. The fourth was
<lb/>furnished and lighted with orange—the fifth with white—the
<lb/>sixth with violet. The seventh apartment was closely
<lb/>shrouded in black velvet tapestries that hung all over the
<lb/>ceiling and down the walls, falling in heavy folds upon a
<lb/>carpet of the same material and hue. But in this chamber
<lb/>only, the color of the windows failed to correspond with the
<lb/>decorations. The panes here were scarlet—a deep blood
<lb/>color. Now in no one of the seven apartments was there
<lb/>any lamp or candelabrum, amid the profusion of golden or-
<lb break="no"/>naments that lay scattered to and fro or depended from the
<lb/>roof. There was no light of any kind emanating from lamp
<lb/>or candle within the suite of chambers. But in the corridors
<lb/>that followed the suite, there stood, opposite to each window,
<lb/>a heavy tripod, bearing a brazier of fire that projected its
<lb/>rays through the tinted glass and so glaringly illumined the
<lb/>room. And thus were produced a multitude of gaudy and
<lb/>fantastic appearances. But in the western or black chamber
<lb/>the effect of the fire-light that streamed upon the dark hang-
<lb break="no"/>ings through the blood-tinted panes, was ghastly in the ex-
<lb break="no"/>treme, and produced so wild a look upon the countenances
<lb/>of those who entered, that there were few of the company
<lb/>bold enough to set foot within its precincts at all.</p><p></p><p>It was in this apartment, also, that there stood against the
<lb/>western wall, a gigantic clock of ebony. Its pendulum
<lb/>swung to and fro with a dull, heavy, monotonous clang;
<lb/>and when the minute-hand made the circuit of the face, and
<lb/>the hour was to be stricken, there came from the brazen
<lb/>lungs of the clock a sound which was clear and loud and deep
<lb/>and exceedingly musical, but of so peculiar a note and em-
<lb break="no"/>phasis that, at each lapse of an hour, the musicians of the
<lb/>orchestra were constrained to pause, momentarily, in their
<lb/>performance, to harken to the sound; and thus the waltzers</p><p><pb n="18"/>
</p><p>perforce ceased their evolutions; and there was a brief dis-
<lb break="no"/>concert of the whole gay company ; and, while the chimes
<lb/>of the clock yet rang, it was observed that the giddiest grew
<lb/>pale, and the more aged and sedate passed their hands over
<lb/>their brows as if in confused reverie or meditation. But when
<lb/>the echoes had fully ceased, a light laughter at once pervad-
<lb break="no"/>ed the assembly; the musicians looked at each other and
<lb/>smiled as if at their own nervousness and folly, and made
<lb/>whispering vows, each to the other, that the next chiming
<lb/>of the clock should produce in them no similar emotion ; and
<lb/>then, after the lapse of sixty minutes, (which embrace three
<lb/>thousand and six hundred seconds of the Time that flies,)
<lb/>there came yet another chiming of the clock, and then were
<lb/>the same disconcert and tremulousness and meditation as be-
<lb break="no"/>fore.</p><p></p><p>But, in spite of these things, it was a gay and magnificent
<lb/>revel. The tastes of the duke were peculiar. He had a fine
<lb/>eye for colors and effects. He disregarded the decora of mere
<lb/>fashion. His plans were bold and fiery, and his conceptions
<lb/>glowed with barbaric lustre. There are some who would
<lb/>have thought him mad. His followers felt that he was not.
<lb/>It was necessary to hear and see and touch him to be sure
<lb/>that he was not.</p><p></p><p>He had directed, in great part, the moveable embellish-
<lb break="no"/>ments of the seven chambers, upon occasion of this great
<lb/>fete; and it was his own guiding taste which had given
<lb/>character to the masqueraders. Be sure they were grotesque.
<lb/>There were much glare and glitter and piquancy and phan-
<lb break="no"/>tasm—much of what has been since seen in “ Hernani.’
<lb/>There were arabesque figures with unsuited limbs and ap-
<lb break="no"/>pointments. There were delirious fancies such as the mad-
<lb break="no"/>man fashions. There was much of the beautiful, much of
<lb/>the wanton, much of the bizarre, something of the terrible,
<lb/>and not a little of that which might have excited disgust. To
<lb/>and fro in the seven chambers there stalked, in fact, a multi-
<lb break="no"/>tude of dreams. And these—the dreams—writhed in and
<lb/>about, taking hue from the rooms, and causing the wild mu-
<lb break="no"/>sic of the orchestra to seem as the echo of their steps. And,
<lb/>anon, there strikes the ebony clock which stands in the hall
<lb/>of the velvet. And then, for a moment, all is still, and all
<lb/>is silent save the voice of the clock. The dreams are stiff-
<lb break="no"/>frozen as they stand. But the echoes of the chime die away
<lb/>—they have endured but an instant—and a light, half-sub-
<lb break="no"/>dued laughter floats after them as they depart. And now
<lb/>again the music swells, and the dreams live, and writhe to
<lb/>and fro more merrily than ever, taking hue from the many
<lb/>tinted windows through which stream the rays from the
<lb/>tripods. But to the chamber which lies most westwardly of
<lb/>the seven, there are now none of the maskers who venture:
<lb/>for the night is waning away; and there flows a ruddier light
<lb/>through the blood-colored panes ; and the blackness of the
<lb/>sable drapery appals ; and to him whose foot falls upon the
<lb/>sable carpet, there comes from the near clock of ebony a
<lb/>muffled peal more solemly emphatic than any which reaches
<lb/>their ears who indulge in the more remote gaieties of the oth-
<lb break="no"/>er apartments.</p><p></p><p>But these other apartments were densely crowded, and in
<lb/>them beat feverishly the heart of life. And the revel went
<lb/>whirlingly on, until at length there commenced the sounding
<lb/>of midnight upou the clock. And then the music ceased, as
<lb/>I have told ; and the evolutions of the waltzers were quieted ;
<lb/>and there was an uneasy cessation of all things as before.
<lb/>But now there were twelve strokes to be sounded by the bell
<lb/>of the clock ; and thus it happened, perhaps, that more of
<lb/>thought crept, with more of lime, into the meditations of
<lb/>the thoughtful among those who revelled. And thus, too, it</p><p>r
</p><p> happened, perhaps, that before the last echoes of the last
<lb/> chime had utterly sunk into silence, there were many indi-
<lb break="no"/> viduals in the crowd who had found leisure to become aware
<lb/> of the presence of a masked figure which had arrested the
<lb/>attention of no single individual before. And the rumor of
<lb/>this new presence having spread itself whisperingly around,
<lb/> there arose at length from the whole company a buzz, or
<lb/> murmur, expressive of disapprobation and surprise—then,
<lb/>finally, of terror, of horror, and of disgust.</p><p></p><p>In an assembly of phantasms such as I have painted, it
<lb/>may well be supposed that no ordinary appearance could
<lb/>have excited such sensation. In truth the masquerade li-
<lb break="no"/>cense of the night was nearly unlimited ; but the figure in
<lb/>question had out-Heroded Herod, and gone beyond the bounds
<lb/>of even the prince's indefinite decorum. There are chords in
<lb/>the hearts of the most reckless which cannot be touched with-
<lb break="no"/>out emotion. Even with the utterly lost, to whom life and
<lb/>death are equally jests, there are matters of which no jest con
<lb/>be made. The whole company, indeed, seemed now deeply
<lb/>to feel that in the costume and bearing of the stranger neither
<lb/>wit nor propriety existed. The figure was tall and gaunt,
<lb/>and shrouded from head to foot in the habiliments of the
<lb/>grave. The mask which concealed the visage was made so
<lb/>nearly to resemble the countenance of a stiffened corpse that
<lb/>the closest scrutiny must have had difficulty in detecting
<lb/>the cheat. And yet all this might have been endured, if not
<lb/>approved, by the mad revellers around. But the mummer
<lb/>had gone so far as to assume the type of the Red Death.
<lb/>His vesture was dabbled in blood—and his broad brow, with
<lb/>all the features of the face, was besprinkled with the scarlet
<lb/>horror.</p><p></p><p>When the eyes of Prince Prospero fell upon this spectral
<lb/>image (which with a slow and solemn movement, as if more
<lb/>fully to sustain its role, stalkod to and fro among the waltz-
<lb break="no"/>ers) he was seen to be convulsed, in the first moment with a
<lb/>strong shudder either of terror or distaste ; but, in the next,
<lb/>his brow reddened with rage.</p><p></p><p>“ Who dares ?" he demanded hoarsely of the courtiers
<lb/>who stood near him—“ who dares insult us with this blas-
<lb break="no"/>phemous mockery ? Seize him and unmask him—that we
<lb/>may know whom we have to hang at sunrise, from the bat-
<lb break="no"/>tlements !”</p><p></p><p>It was in the eastern or blue chamber in which stood the
<lb/>Prince Prospero as he uttered these words. They rang
<lb/>throughout the seven rooms loudly and clearly—for the
<lb/>prince was a bold and robust man, and the music had be-
<lb break="no"/>come hushed at the waving of his hand.</p><p></p><p>It was in the blue room where stood the prince, with a
<lb/>group of pale courtiers by his side. At first, as he spoke,
<lb/>there was a slight rushing movement of this group in the di-
<lb break="no"/>rection of the intruder, who at the moment was also near at
<lb/>hand, and now, with deliberate and stately step, made clo-
<lb break="no"/> ser approach to the speaker. But from a certain nameless
<lb/>awe with which the mad assumptions of the mummer had</p><p></p><p>inspired the whole party, there were found none who put
<lb/>forth hand to seize him; so that, unimpeded, he passed
<lb/>within a yard of the prince’s person ; and, while the vast as-
<lb break="no"/>sembly, as if with one impulse, shrank from the centres of
<lb/>the rooms to the walls, he made his way uninterruptedly, but
<lb/>with the same solemn and measured step which had distin-
<lb break="no"/>guished him from the first, through the blue chamber to the
<lb/>purple—through the purple to the green—through the green
<lb/>to the orange—through this again to the white—and even
<lb/>thence to the violet, ere a decided movement had been made
<lb/>to arrest him. It was then, however, that the Prince Pros-
<lb break="no"/>pero, maddening with rage and the shame of his own mo-</p><p><pb n="19" break="no" />
</p><p>mentary cowardice, rushed hurriedly through the six cham-
<lb break="no"/>bers, while none followed him on account of a deadly terror
<lb/>that had seized upon all. He bore aloft a drawn dagger, and
<lb/>had approached, in rapid impetuosity, to within three or four
<lb/>feet of the retreating figure, when the latter, having attain-
<lb break="no"/>ed the extremity of the velvet apartment, turned suddenly
<lb/>and confronted his pursuer. There was a sharp cry—and
<lb/>the dagger dropped gleaming upon the sable carpet, up-
<lb break="no"/>on which, instantly afterwards, fell prostrate in death the
<lb/>Prince Prospero. Then, summoning the wild courage of de-
<lb break="no"/>spair, a throng of the revellers at once threw themselves into
<lb/>the black apartment, and, seizing the mummer, whose tall
<lb/>figure stood erect and motionless within the shadow of the
<lb/>ebony clock, gasped in unutterable horror at finding the
<lb/>grave-cerements and corpse-like mask which they handled
<lb/>with so violent a rudeness, untenanted by any tangible form.</p><p></p><p>And now was acknowledged the presence of the Red
<lb/>Death. He had come like a thief in the night. And one by
<lb/>one dropped the revellers in the blood-bedewed halls of their
<lb/>revel, and died each in the despairing posture of his fall.
<lb/>And the life of the ebony clock went out with that of the last
<lb/>of the gay. And the flames of the tripods expired. And
<lb/>Darkness and Decay and the Red Death held illimitable do-
<lb break="no"/>minion over all.</p><p>EDGAR A. POE.
IMAGINATION.
An arch immeasurably tower’d
Where Aiden’s glories spring,
And through the opened diamond valves
Majestically strode the King.
Truth, with a crown of stars
On a large brow free from stain,
While all her motions music made,
Held up his royal train:
Flowers of a rare undying hue
Sprang round the glowing arch,
And tones, that float like a seraph’s note,
Rolled out a solemn march.
'T was when the Deity appeared
Beneath the portal's flame,
He felt his might, and in the light
Creator then became.
His kindled mind conceived a sun,
</p><p>And out the great fire burst
<lb/>From Chaos that fell shuddering back
<lb/>Like a fiend accursed :</p><p>And still the God-head wrought,
</p><p>Wrought still the poet-power,
<lb/>While Time was spending on the earth
<lb/>His primal hour.</p><p>The labor yet went on
Where Chaos heard the curse,
Nor ceased till in a sea of space 
Floated a universe.	WM. WALLACE.
The Contrasted Prejudices.
</p><p>The Avon bard has sung in sweet tune, and we, essaying to
<lb/>make the belief ours, hum after him, “ What’s in a name?”
<lb/>But experience has an opposing conviction ; it rises up with
<lb/>the argument, much is in a name, and each of us has many
<lb/>clinging associations to maintain the affirmative. How
<lb/>eagerly we inquire the name baptismal name especially,) of
<lb/>a person whom we have not yet seen, and how hastily, deter-
<lb break="no"/>mine his appearance, whether he will be agreeable, or
<lb/>repellent to us, from our association with what he is
<lb/>called.</p><p></p><p>So it is; we are creatures of strange prejudices; these,
<lb/>though, are not wholly unaccountable. We can sometimes
<lb/>trace their origin back even to our cradles. The first lullaby
<lb/>we have any recollection of, is linked with a name, loved for
<lb/>the one who hushed us into rest with its soothing strain ; or
<lb/>recurs to us unpleasantly as we remember some discordant
<lb/>chiding for our playful wakefulness. The sweet sound of
<lb/>Viola at once creates a phantom of loveliness. And what
<lb/>more appropriate name for a sunny faced, budding little
<lb/>beauty, than Rosa. And Mary, the pet call with so many,
<lb/>in all degrees of life. It graces the lonely cot, and softens
<lb/>the splendor of the palace. The downcast, modest eye, and
<lb/>fair Madonna brow, steal upon you, with the graceful tie of
<lb/>piety and love, attached for so many centuries to the gentle
<lb/>sound.</p><p></p><p>With what nicety an author selects a title for his romance !
<lb/>he well knows what depends on it ; frequently the remark
<lb/>has reached us, “ I will read it, if I like the name.” “ The
<lb/>Pirate,” charming—we are certain here is a rich treat of love
<lb/>and venture; already we are interested in the hero, though he
<lb/>may be</p><p>“ Link’d with one virtue, and a thousand crimes.”
</p><p>It is needless for me to enumerate more instances of the
<lb/>tenacity with which our prejudices hold to us, (for all can
<lb/>recall likes and dislikes, associated with names and places,)
<lb/>but I will hasten to relate one which followed me for many
<lb/>years like a grim spectre.</p><p></p><p>The first horror that presented itself to me at the threshold
<lb/>of discernible life, was the woman who presided over the
<lb/>department of edibles in my father’s house. She was the
<lb/>cook par excellence, and we the envied of the neighbourhood.
<lb/>Whenever a dinner or supper was to be given, (even in the
<lb/>most remote house of the block,) she was duly consulted as
<lb/>to the propriety of such and such dishes, which in her im-
<lb break="no"/>portant opinion should be placed the first before the guests.
<lb/>If it chanced we wished any change, the suggestion was po-
<lb break="no"/> litely made, for none ventured to find fault with her arrange-
<lb break="no"/>ments. At once the assurance was given, that it was “ dress-
<lb break="no"/>ed precisely in the manner my lord had it served up to him,
<lb/>and surely such quality knew what good eating was.”</p><p></p><p>This was a quietus to the matter; and the dish was tasted
<lb/>of by all, to which “ my lord” had set his imperishable seal
<lb/>of approbation in the brain of our good cook. Thanks to
<lb/>her, for my first impression of the blessings of a Republic,
<lb/>as my youthful fancy pictured the frightful rule of lords, and
<lb/>a land where people could not eat what best pleased them.</p><p></p><p>Follow me now into her empire no Sultana ever swayed
<lb/>her waiting-woman with more despotic rule, than she the
<lb/>other domestics of the house. Every article had its place.
<lb/>The saucepans hung in a row and told of the labor be-
<lb break="no"/>stowed upon them. The kitchen was radiant with the glow of
<lb/>the tortured metal. If one passed, and accidentally unhung
<lb/>a skewer from its culinary gibbet, the tumult was enough to
<lb/>give rise to the supposition that the premises were crumbling
<lb/>in, and utter destruction inevitable, unless the spot was
<lb/>speedily vacated.</p><p></p><p>The name of this wonder of my juvenile days, was Hannah
<lb/>Johnson; she was a native of England, and had come to this
<lb/>country to live with her son, Samuel Johnson. I know not
<lb/>if he boasted being of the lineage of his illustrious predecessor
<lb/>and LL. D., of the same name, but he was a clever young
<lb/>man, and filled his calling with propriety. He was a super-
<lb break="no"/>numerary clerk in my father’s counting-house, transacting
<lb/>some little of the business, and performing all the menial re-
<lb break="no"/>quirements. Samuel was the surviving child of five. Only</p><p><pb n="20"/>
</p><p>a few months the mother and son realised the comfort of be-
<lb break="no"/>ing together; he also died, and the mother was left destitute.
<lb/>My father being aware of this, arrangements were made,
<lb/>and she was received at home, where her grief was soon
<lb/>dispelled by the continued employment she had allotted her-
<lb break="no"/>self.</p><p></p><p>In appearance, she will stand for time immemorial, unique.
<lb/>She was tall, far above the usual height of women, and
<lb/>muscular, as though she had practised gymnastic exercises all
<lb/>her life; undeniably belonging to the “locomotive order.”
<lb/>Her eyes were large, pale blue, and protruding. Hair of the
<lb/>peculiar dapple grey I have always given in my fancy to
<lb/>witches, parted smoothly on her yellow seamed forehead,
<lb/>and adorned by a snowy white linen cap, with a border about
<lb/>four inches wide, standing erect around her face in bold de-
<lb break="no"/>fiance, looking as if the fashion of Queen Bess’ frill was re-
<lb break="no"/>vived again, and rebelliously mounted to encircle a face, in-
<lb break="no"/>stead of cautiously standing up in ready defence for the neck.
<lb/>Her gown was composed of that blue domestic spotted with
<lb/>white, which was at one time the usual working attire of
<lb/>people in her capacity, but now has entirely faded from
<lb/>sight, and almost recollection. Upon great occasions, this
<lb/>was thrown aside for a calamanco, she had “bought when
<lb/>dear George was a baby, and if he had lived, he would have
<lb/>been nine the day she left for this country,” and fixed in my
<lb/>memory, for seventeen years she was a moveable in our house,
<lb/>and still the rustling dress was presentable. The dress so far
<lb/>met with my approval, but her neck-gear was a dense mys-
<lb break="no"/>tery, and the cause of many a strange surmise. Winter and
<lb/>summer it was wrapt in a strip of red flannel, which was
<lb/>never laid aside, unless to be replaced by a similar piece,
<lb/>whilst the cast off underwent a washing, and was stretched
<lb/>on a little board for the noon-day sun to dry. Whether it
<lb/>was intended as a preventive against affections of the
<lb/>throat, or a slow cure, or perhaps a talisman, I never could
<lb/>ascertain; still, year in, and year out, the rubyish necklace
<lb/>obstinately obtruded on the eye. I never since have met with
<lb/>any one who was not accessible in some way : all the blan-
<lb break="no"/>dishments of childhood were used, pins, needles, thread-
<lb break="no"/>cases, and even pinafores were purchased for her out of
<lb/>my pocket-money, in hopes of getting a little kindness in re-
<lb break="no"/>turn. A portion of each Sunday evening, I left the family
<lb/>circle, and spent reading to Hannah, and never concluded
<lb/>the favor, without going over her choicest selection, “The
<lb/>order for the burial of the dead,” from, “ I am the resurrection
<lb/>and the life,” to the close, which always drew forth her most
<lb/>hearty “ amen.” Affection she had for none, except for an
<lb/>old black cat, that at night slept by her feel, and mewed at
<lb/>them through the day. In the animal creation, this was the
<lb/>only living thing that elicited her admiration. Black and
<lb/>sleek she was, without one white hair to redeem her in my
<lb/>estimation from the name of jet; but this was not the naming
<lb/>suited to her; she was called Blanche, after one of “my
<lb/>lord’s” accomplished danghters. The said cat, and a bundle
<lb/>of patches, comprised her earthly treasure; the latter she
<lb/>reverently looked over occasionally, and pointed out: “ this
<lb/>was dear John’s, this that blessed boy, Sammy’s, &amp;c.,” until
<lb/>she had shown a sample of the clothes once worn by each
<lb/>of her departed children.</p><p></p><p>Gratitude was held by her to be the crowning virtue,
<lb/>though it was never manifested in words or deeds of love,
<lb/>but cold, rigid justice ; “ ingratitude,” she would say, “is the
<lb/>blackest of crimes." “Yes, Hannah,” my brother Harry
<lb/>would playfully reply, “he that's ungrateful has no guilt
<lb/>but one; all other crimes may pass for virtues in him.” “ Oh !
<lb/>that poesy, Mister Harry, was made for the drawing-room,</p><p></p><p>and folk what don’t like anything but what’s dressed up, but,
<lb/>for my part, I say in plain English, it’s no better than steal-
<lb break="no"/>ing.” Yet, with this unexceptionable sentiment, she was the
<lb/>most disagreeable person I ever encountered. Her very
<lb/>name, Hannah, was hateful to me.</p><p></p><p>If any of my schoolmates were so unfortunately called,
<lb/>they seldom knew any of my indulgence. I would not prompt
<lb/>them in a lesson, or assist with an exercise, and preferred to
<lb/>be alone to being escorted by Hannahs. When I studied
<lb/>Mythology, I wondered if Proserpine did not wear a red ban-
<lb break="no"/>dage around her neck as a mark of designation for the queen
<lb/> of hell. I sometimes thought she might be Lot’s wife come
<lb/>back to earth to atone for her disobedience; so rocky, so un-
<lb break="no"/>womanly was she.</p><p></p><p>When I was about fourteen my mother laid before me
<lb/>several works she especially wished me to read. This I
<lb/>thought no hardship, (for I was fond of reading), until my
<lb/>eye fell upon “Life and Writings of Hannah More.” I was
<lb/>electrified, and quietly slipped the volumes back into the book
<lb/>case, ejaculating (wittily as I thought) “ pray, no more Han-
<lb break="no"/>nah !”</p><p></p><p>In vain I urged her removal from the house, as a nuisance.
<lb/>Mother said she was an invaluable creature; my father pitied
<lb/>her loneliness, and Harry; the sharer of my joys and sorrows,
<lb/>liked to have her to plague and laugh at. Once, and only
<lb/>once, was she tenderly moved for one of us. I was ill,—a
<lb/>tear glistened in her eye as she hoped “ Miss Kate would not
<lb/>die, for who else would read to her.”</p><p></p><p>Thus time sped on. My brother who was in the navy,
<lb/>and had been for nearly three years kept at southern sta-
<lb break="no"/>tions, wrote to us. He had “at last concluded to light up
<lb/>the dreariness of life, and take to himself a wife.” He de-
<lb break="no"/>scribed the lady as highly intelligent, and quite pretty
<lb/>enough ; but did not give her name. However, I was de-
<lb break="no"/>lighted at the prospect of Harry’s future happiness, and plea-
<lb break="no"/>sed with the thought of having so companionable a person
<lb/>for my sister. The next letter dealt the blow,—she was call-
<lb break="no"/>ed Hannah Fairfax. Fairfax contented me, but Hannah, oh
<lb/>horror ! how could I receive her without giving offence ?
<lb/>Impossible! I never could like her. Treat her as a sister ?
<lb/>No, no, the welcome she met with must come from others
<lb/>of the family, for Kate Rodney would be out of the way
<lb/>when another Hannah arrived. Thoughts like these ran
<lb/>through my silly head. I said little about the wedding, or
<lb/>our expected guest, but my nurtured prejudice was suspect-
<lb break="no"/>ed, and spoken of by my fond mother, though she did not
<lb/>endeavor to dissuade me from it, but left it to the removal of
<lb/>time and reason. We were all on the stilts of expectation ;
<lb/>even myself, though I differed from the rest, for I lamented
<lb/>the pain I inevitably would cause my brother.</p><p></p><p>Night—a winter night again gathered us around the bright,
<lb/>peaceful hearth of home. My father was reading aloud,
<lb/>whilst my mother was webbing some fancy article for one
<lb/>of the gifts of love and welcome to the unknown comer. I,
<lb/>apparently was idle, but in reality busily engaged, far in a
<lb/>chaotic reverie of pleasure and disappointment; when it was
<lb/>broken in upon by the sound of stopping carriage wheels, and
<lb/>a well known voice in the hall told me Harry and the shock
<lb/>had arrived. I closed my eyes as he entered the parlor, but
<lb/>opened them, (for I had nerved myself) when I heard him
<lb/>say, “here dear father and mother is your daughter Hannah."
<lb/>My head reeled; a revolution had taken place. I thought he
<lb/>said “Heavenly,” and not “Hannah." Unconsciously I uttered,
<lb/>"Angelic !’’ for such was the being who was encircled in our
<lb/>mother’s arms. She was one of the most lovely I ever look-
<lb break="no"/>ed upon,—her soft hazel, beseeching eyes, asked for lore,—</p><p><pb n="21"/>
her forehead was low, but faultlessly white, and draped by j
folds of the richest black hair Her form was a Houri’s.
</p><p>Daily this gentle being won upon me. She was the love-
<lb break="no"/>ly moonlight to our summer home; every one loved her, in-
<lb break="no"/>deed it was impossible not to. The bliss of her husband
<lb/>seemed entire, and I trembled lest it was too much for earth,
<lb/>and ere long would be interrupted. Wherever I went I
<lb/>wished Hannah with me. A party had not its complement
<lb/>of beauty if she was not there. A book read with but half
<lb/>the zest, if she did not peruse it with me ; in fact she had
<lb/>become an essential in my cup of happiness. Still her name
<lb/>was not wholly endurable, for a long time. I called her
<lb/>Annie. At last an event occurred which was to be the buri-
<lb break="no"/>al of my prejudice,—the birth of a daughter. It was deter-
<lb break="no"/>mined the little stranger should be called Hannah,—the
<lb/>name of my sister’s mother, whose memory she cherished,
<lb/>with the sacredness of an affectionate daughter and sensitive
<lb/>woman. How dearly I loved this liny one ! Scarcely a cap
<lb/>could be found pretty enough for the velvety face, or socks
<lb/>soft as the dainty wee feet they were to enclose. This little
<lb/>love was another jewel to our diadem of happy home,—
<lb/>never were one and all more joyous.</p><p></p><p>Even old Hannah looked well pleased, and hobbled in to
<lb/>the christening, for she had two reasons for wishing to be
<lb/>there. “ Mr. Rodney had been even as kind as ' my lord,’
<lb/>and she had seen all his children christened,” (to witness the
<lb/>baptism of a grandchild was I presume a greater pleasure
<lb/>and compliment.) “Then Miss Kate, the baby’s name is
<lb/>just what I like.” For better than a year she had been una-
<lb break="no"/>ble to work, but imagined her control not yet at an end, and
<lb/>actually hastened the decline of years, grieving over the
<lb/>waste which must be during her absence; retaining only
<lb/>breath to utter her final amen as she beckoned me to her bed
<lb/>side, and pointed to the prayer book.</p><p></p><p>Poor Hannah ! that she had an annoying temper none can
<lb/>deny, but she practised virtues many do not even compre-
<lb break="no"/>hend—justice and gratitude.</p><p></p><p>A miniature Babel is below stairs ;—the fourth anniversary
<lb/>of the birth of aunty’s pet; and she must join the little revel-
<lb break="no"/>lers in a game of “ hot butter blue beans” or “ blind man's
<lb/>buff”, twine a wreath for the evening's Queen, and help eat
<lb/>bon-bons. Oh the laughing ones ! lovely budding flowers,
<lb/>each possessing an imperishable germ. To be in such an
<lb/>assemblage of innocence and beauty, makes one feel very
<lb/>young again ; if time or care has impressed a furrow, it is
<lb/>hushed away for the present.</p><p></p><p>Reader, I can tarry with you no longer ; but thanks for list-
<lb break="no"/>ening to my story, and if you hold a similar dislike to a name
<lb/>because of a disagreeable person, then seek a lovelier associ-
<lb break="no"/>ation to render it musical, and believe me you can succeed.
<lb/>Our great will should not be kept subservient to prejudices.</p><p>SONNET TO ZANTE.
Fair isle, that, from the fairest of all flowers,
Thy gentlest of all gentle names dost take !
How many memories of what radiant hours

How many visions of a maiden that is

EDGAR A. POE.
The Antigone.
</p><p>I had been to see the Antigone of Sophocles not long
<lb/>since, and sate through the five acts and four choruses with
<lb/>mingled feelings of pleasure at the recollections of my school-
<lb break="no"/>boy love for antiquity, which the scenes and action recalled,
<lb/>and of disappointment that the translation so feebly shadowed
<lb/>the nervous language and imagery of the most philosophical
<lb/>of tragedians. In fact, what Porson had said of Pope's Iliad,</p><p>“ It is a very pretty poem, Mr. Pope, but you must not call it
Homer,” seemed doubly applicable to the present instance.
</p><p>I had left the theatre in this mood, thinking only of what I
<lb/>had seen, not of what I had read, and at the door was ad-
<lb break="no"/>dressed by Leslie, the Alcibiades of my acquaintance. He
<lb/>thus addressed me : “ Come to my room, most Athenian, for
<lb/>if I remember well, of all the band who walked with me
<lb/>in the Academic Grove of Cambridge, you were the most
<lb/>entirely Hellenic; come with me, and while I uncork some
<lb/>wine of Cyprus, (it must be my substitute for Chian), we will
<lb/>talk over the new Antigone and the old one, grow classical,
<lb/>as we sacrifice to Dionusos, and fancy ourselves beneath the
<lb/>shadow of the Hill of Mars, and inhaling the balmy air that
<lb/>sweeps over Old OEgea, Plataea and Salamis.” Though
<lb/>unused to revel “ late of nights,” the temptation was too
<lb/>strong to be resisted.</p><p></p><p>Leslie was domiciled in a quiet street not far from Hudson
<lb/>Park, a key to which he has, and often with him I sate, in
<lb/>the shadow of its trees, and discoursed of similar themes.
<lb/>On that night, however, we were in his library, in which was
<lb/>more than one cast from the great modern and ancient sculp-
<lb break="no"/>tors, and in which was found most that was valuable in the
<lb/>reveries of philosophers and delicious in the dreams of poets.
<lb/>Upon the table lay open a volume of Sophocles, with which
<lb/>he had been evidently occupied, previous to leaving for the the-
<lb break="no"/>atre, to which I naturally turned while he occupied himself
<lb/>in bringing from an adjoining room, not a bottle, but a narrow
<lb/>necked vessel with a handle of twined serpents on each side,
<lb/>giving it a semblance to an ancient amphora, and two cya-
<lb break="no"/>thoi, not glasses. In this, however, he was not strictly cor-
<lb break="no"/>rect, and the vessel and cyathoi were evidently not Grecian
<lb/>but Etruscan or Pelasgican their shape. “I brought these,”
<lb/>said he, speaking to me, “ from Herculaneum, where I
<lb/>bribed the keepers, as Italians of modern times may always
<lb/>be bribed. I did it too with a safe conscience. I know not why
<lb/>the King of Naples should monopolize what must have been
<lb/>intended as a legacy to Posterity. The wine is a present
<lb/>from the Captain of the brig AEgeus, in which I came hither
<lb/>from Smyrna, in company with a midshipman, three Jews,
<lb/>and a cargo of tigs. But, fill up, and let us drink to the
<lb/>memory of the Athenian drama! After that we must deter-
<lb break="no"/>mine whether one of the next cups shall not be to its Anas-
<lb break="no"/>lasts."</p><p></p><p>I had thrown myself upon a chaise longue, not unlike
<lb/>the couch of the classic ages, and resting my head upon a
<lb/>pillow which meetly might have supported Croesus in his
<lb/>prosperous days, began to sip from the cyathos the delicious
<lb/>wine, which reflected, in its purple depths, the delicate tra-
<lb break="no"/>cery of vine-leaves and grapes, with which it was overlaid.
<lb/>I know not how it was, but I remember that while Leslie
<lb/>spoke one of those glittering phrases which fall from his
<lb/>lips like drops of honey from Hybla, and whose subject was
<lb/>Alcibiades, I fell asleep. It may be that, inclined somewhat
<lb/>to the philosophy of the porch, the strong Cyprus had over-
<lb break="no"/>come my senses, and that I had poured too deep a libation
<lb/>to Bacchus.</p><p><pb n="22"/>
</p><p>Straight it seemed to me that Alcibiades entered, clad in
<lb/>the rich and spotless dress of his day, with the crimson bus-
<lb break="no"/>kin and Median train. Perfumes dripped from his waving
<lb/>hair, and many a jewel sparkled upon his marble fingers.
<lb/>Without more ado, he threw himself beside us, and filling
<lb/>from the amphora a beaker, with his fingers filliped a few
<lb/>drops upon an inkstand, fashioned in the shape of an ancient
<lb/>altar, murmured the word “ Dionuso,” and quaffed it down
<lb/>bocca aperta.</p><p></p><p>“ Your wine,” said he, “ is good ; I like most, however,
<lb/>the rich Italian and Ionian wines. That of Chios and Cy-
<lb break="no"/>prus is too strong and heavy for me ; yet Salustius, a Roman,
<lb/>who, 450 Olympiads since, joined us enerthen, tells me that
<lb/>the wines of Falernum are thrice as strong as this. Antho-
<lb break="no"/>ny Hamilton tells me that those of Spain, and that grown in
<lb/>islands of which we had not very vivid ideas—our Islands
<lb/>of the Blest, are yet more potent; verily as the world grows
<lb/>older, your taste for excitement increases.”</p><p></p><p>This remark astonished me, because, though, as the great
<lb/>master of the porch had taught, I believe in the identity and
<lb/>personality of the dead in Hades, I had no idea they lived so
<lb/>sociably as Alcibiades seemed to insinuate; at the lime, how-
<lb break="no"/>ever, I did not speak of it, thinking, possibly, that it might
<lb/>not be polite to recall to a gentleman and a stranger that he
<lb/>was a subject of the Plutonian realm. I fancy that my
<lb/>distaste to this, was, in character, similar to the feeling a
<lb/>well-bred Englishman would entertain at asking an Ameri-
<lb break="no"/>can the news from Pennsylvania. “ We drank,” continued
<lb/>he, “some tolerable wine, grown in the neighborhood of
<lb/>AEtna, last night, which was not unlike this, and, as we sat
<lb/>over our cups, I heard that a tragedy of old Sophocles’ was
<lb/>to be represented, and could not resist the temptation to visit
<lb/>anothen again. I was fond of Sophocles.”</p><p>“ But,” said Leslie, “ I knew not that you gentlemen sha-
dows often visited us.”
</p><p>“ We do not. It has been some years since I was up.—
<lb/>It was when a mad fellow named Bozzaris, near the field of
<lb/>old Plataea, fought with and conquered the Scythian horde,
<lb/>who now have possession of the soil of Hellas.”</p><p>" Oh !” said I, “ you have heard of Bozzaris.”
</p><p>“Yes, a poetaster, a countryman of your own, named
<lb/>Drake, some four Olympiads since, joined us, and recited
<lb/>some glorious verses, which served as a fitting introduction
<lb/>for him to the whole population of Hades. Besides, some of
<lb/>us Greeks had previously heard of Bozzaris from countrymen
<lb/>of our own, who had died in the strife with the Scythians,
<lb/>(Turcomans you call them.)”</p><p>“Well, the schoolmaster is abroad,” said Leslie, “he is
even gone to the Devil.”
</p><p>“ I know not that word, or its precise meaning; some Io-
<lb break="no"/>nians I have heard, speak of the Heiraoi ; they believe in a
<lb/>power antagonist to their God, whom they cal! Diabolos."</p><p>“I assure you, Diabolos is here all potent, almost as the
Hatui, of which your old tragedians spoke so much.”
</p><p>“ You have, then, more than one God. Count Anthony
<lb/>said you had but one. I did not, however, understand him,
<lb/>as I knew your Allan tides were not Epicureans, and men
<lb/>have loo many wants for one God to be able to attend them
<lb/>all.”</p><p></p><p>Conversation then waned for a moment, while we more
<lb/>than once replenished our cyathoi from the amphora. It as-
<lb break="no"/>tonished me somewhat that Alcibiades did not respond to
<lb/>us while we drank his health, but, after a few moments, I
<lb/>remembered that was a custom derived from our northern
<lb/>progenitors. At length we began to speak of the subject
<lb/>matter, the Antigone, and Alcibiades remarked—</p><p></p><p>“ As I sate last night in the Koilon, I was pleased to see
<lb/> that women sate in the lowest row, showing that the wives
<lb/>and daughters of the principal citizens sate with them to wit-
<lb break="no"/>ness the play : verily the cool determination of Eurydice and
<lb/> of Antigone seemed to blanch their cheeks. Our fair Athe-
<lb break="no"/> nians would not accompany us to such places:—true, Aspasia
<lb/>did so, but then, you know, she was differently situated. A
<lb/>rare woman was Aspasia.”</p><p>“ Yes, we have heard of her.”
</p><p>“The music pleases me; in that you have made great
<lb/>improvements. You have adopted the brazen instruments
<lb/>of the Medes and the delicate Spartan flute. The Medea of
<lb/> Euripides would, from the joint accompaniment, have had a
<lb/>double effect. Even the Ocean Nymphs, and the Gossamer
<lb/>Spirits of the Air, who came to the crags of Caucasus to
<lb/>console the Prometheus Desmotes, would have found a music
<lb/>soft as their own voices.”</p><p>“ What thought you then of the declamation ?”
</p><p>“What could I think? The Creon was not so good as
<lb/>Pratinas, or as other actors whom I have known, but he
<lb/>knew his part and felt it. The words of Sophocles, if the actor
<lb/>but feels them, cannot be marred. The Antigone and Euri-
<lb break="no"/>dice were played so well, they seemed to me women.
<lb/>Yet there were discords. I use that term to express things
<lb/>to which I am unused. The appurtenances of the tiring
<lb/>room seem to me incompatible. No Anax ever dressed as
<lb/>Creon did ; where was his sword? and Eurydice wore the
<lb/>crescent of a Priestess of Athena, not of a Grecian matron.
<lb/>The tragedy, however, may not be marred ; indeed old Thes-
<lb break="no"/>pis, in his wagon knew not, five hundred Olympiads ago, that
<lb/>his fame would pass into the Atlantis, of which Plato had
<lb/>not yet written. Your Bronteion, too, is strangely placed :
<lb/>the lightning is from Jove, but the thunder is of Saturn;
<lb/>yours was, I know not where, it seemed to pervade the
<lb/>whole house; but reach me yon amphora ! I will quaff a cup
<lb/>and make a libation to the Hatai: let us sacrifice to them and
<lb/>propitiate them.”</p><p>“But our theatre is small.”
</p><p>“Ah, yes, the very Koilon is not so large as the mere
<lb/>Episkenion of our theatres, which were two stadia in breadth,
<lb/>and made to contain the whole population of Athens, while
<lb/> yours can only contain your wealthiest citizens, those of for-
<lb break="no"/>tune. The slave at the door asked of me for admittance an
<lb/>Attic talent of gold at Athens the price was half an obolus.
<lb/> The great and useful scenes our drama portrays, should, too,
<lb/> be represented in the open air, not within walls. The mar-
<lb break="no"/>ble columns and seats, the beauty of the caryatidae, and the
<lb/>severe and stern serenity of the works of the older sculptors,
<lb/>well befitted the severity of AEschylus, and the philosophy of
<lb/>Sophocles; for Euripides, another model of decoration might
<lb/>be adopted, but it would not be that of the Atrion where I
<lb/>saw the Antigone.</p><p></p><p>“ Reach me again yon amphora. The wine I have usually
<lb/> drank for the last 450 Olympiads, has grown near AEtna or
<lb/>Vesuvius, and has a sulphury twang, not so pleasant as
<lb/>this.”</p><p></p><p>“ One or two things,” said Leslie, “ I wish to ask you of
<lb/>the ancient drama—and the first is, who were the chorus,
<lb/>and where were they placed ? Had they part in the play ?"</p><p></p><p>“ The chorus were musicians, and as the science of har-
<lb break="no"/>mony was not so far advanced as it is now, our instruments
<lb/>were fewer, and the greater part of their music was vocal;
<lb/>they had no part in the action of the play, except that they
<lb/>wore the costume of the age of the actors, and during the
<lb/>changing of the scene, spoke in explanations of allusions,
<lb/>with which the mass of the audience were not familiar.”</p><p><pb n="23"/>
“Did your tragic actors wear masks?”
“ Masks ? what are they ?”
“ Coverings for the face, representing the passion supposed
to characterize the personage they assumed.’’
“ How could that be ? Creon even has his joy, and it must
be expressed, the mask would destroy all expression.”
“ Whence can we have derived the idea ?”
“ Our actors painted, covering the whole face, often thick-
ly enough, that possibly may explain the idea.”
</p><p>“ I do not,” said Leslie, “ see how it was possible for the
<lb/>human voice to reach over the vast extent of your theatres: 
<lb/>even our actors cannot always fill up the circumference of
<lb/>the buildings in which they perform ?”</p><p></p><p>“ Ah,” said Alcibiades, “ we had various contrivances for
<lb/>the purpose of increasing the sound ; among other things, we 
<lb/>used echeea, or their various vases of brass, like to the Egyp- 
<lb/>tian tumpanon, by which the sound was prolonged, and sent 
<lb/>in reverberation to the very verge of the Koilon. These
<lb/>vases were placed upon pedestals, upon which they rested
<lb/>by the contact of but a single point. Over these echeea,
<lb/>which were interspersed through the building, seals were
<lb/>placed, lest the architectural beauty of the building should
<lb/>be marred by their presence. Your vaulted dome must be
<lb/>a great improvement, and a voice of ordinary capacity must,
<lb/>beneath it, be able to reach with distinctness every ear. At
<lb/>Athens, by the gesture alone, was the actor recognised, and
<lb/>that alone was necessary, for every Athenian knew the works
<lb/>of the great Tragedian, as you, doubtless, of your master
<lb/>pieces, and could easily supply any word which he did not
<lb/>hear.</p><p></p><p>“ There were other differences which struck me, too ; they 
<lb/>are not, however, material. The curtain now falls from the
<lb/>roof of the building, on the stage : it was with us drawn up.
<lb/>Usually before the curtain rose, the chorus had taken their
<lb/>places, and the Coryphceus, the Aggelos, usually the first
<lb/>character, spoke the long introductory to the action. It of-
<lb break="no"/>ten seemed to me to be regretted that our tragedians did not
<lb/>adopt some more artful manner of introducing the plot; the
<lb/>custom, however, of all tragedians, has permanently fixed
<lb/>the rule."</p><p>“Did the chorus dance?”
</p><p>“Not generally; if, however, it was composed of fe-
<lb break="no"/>males, it did dance. There was a place called orches-
<lb break="no"/>tra, in our theatres; the word was handed down to us
<lb/>from the very days of Thespis, though its reason, long
<lb/>before, disappeared. The chorus usually clustered around
<lb/>their coryphoeus, who stood on the thumele, where was the
<lb/>altar."</p><p>“ The music you have heard to-day, differs from that of
your nation ?’’
</p><p>“Ah, yes ! ours was monotone, like a Sapphic stanza, fin-
<lb break="no"/>ite and beautiful, not running, as yours does, infinitely through
<lb/>all the changes of Choric verse. Ah, you have much that
<lb/>we were ignorant of: mere music with us, was a womanly
<lb/>art, or rather, a slavish one: with you, however, a poet and
<lb/>philosopher may, without error, devote themselves to so glo-
<lb break="no"/>rious an accomplishment.”</p><p>“ There is one thing more. I did not see you during the
representation; yet, with your graceful and peculiar dress,
I cannot well see how you escaped observation.”
“ Up early enough, the Dianusiakoi Technitoi gave me a
private box.”
</p><p>When I heard this, I remembered that I had seen the
<lb/>sleeve of a white robe, and a jewelled finger occasionally
<lb/>on the outside of the left balcony box! we then sate for
<lb/>for some time, and conversed together. Alcibiades said</p><p></p><p>some prettinesses relative to our number, which was that
<lb/>of the Graces, and other similar things, with which I did not
<lb/>charge my memory, for, recurring to the days of the per-
<lb break="no"/>fection of Grecian drama, I naturally used the system of
<lb/>mnemonics then in vogue, which I will remark, is not near
<lb/>so good as that of Professor Gouraud, whose lectures I have
<lb/>attended, and whose octavo I have read.</p><p></p><p>Alcibiades took hold again of the amphora : it was dry.
<lb/>While I thought Leslie moved to substitute for it another,
<lb/>I awoke, strangely enough; I was alone, except that my
<lb/>host slept soundly; the cyathos overturned, and the Cyprus
<lb/>wine streaming over his bosom. I went home, and began
<lb/>to write out this imaginary conversation, which I have just
<lb/>now finished.	FAY. ROBINSON.</p><p>Correspondence with a Governess.

Dear Mrs. S——,
</p><p>I write to you, without an answer to my last. As I
<lb/>cannot return to my children at present, you must relate to
<lb/>me every thing about them. Please to send me an account
<lb/>of the state of James’ room, when he leaves it in the morn-
<lb break="no"/>ing. He is not as yet so neat and considerate as I wish. I
<lb/>have no severity of feeling on such subjects : carelessness
<lb/>may exist with justice and kindness, and its demonstrations
<lb/>not only be inferior to, but in contrariety with the disposition.
<lb/>He is rather more short of his own ideal than some of the
<lb/>rest. I recommend to him for a motto,</p><p>"Heaven loves the ideal which practises too.”
</p><p>This is a line of Leigh Hunt’s, which I read this morning.
<lb/>I have had great pleasure in turning over the new edition of
<lb/>his poems, just collected in a little volume, where, amidst
<lb/>too much that is vapid and grovelling, there is some of the
<lb/>finest of the fine, I find the story of Ben Adhem somewhat
<lb/>impaired.</p><p>“ Write me as one that loves his fellow men,”
for
“ Ecrivez-moi en quality d’amie de ceux qui aiment Dieu,”
is a less easy and natural transition.
“ Captain Sword and Captain Pen” is very much to the
purpose.
“ Captain Sword,
...... forget the close thought, and the burning heart,
And prayers, and the mild moon hanging apart,
Which lifteth the seas with her gentle looks,
And growth, and death, and immortal books,
And the Infinite Wildness, the soul of souls,
Which layeth earth soft with her silver poles;
Which ruleth the stars and saith not a word;
Whose speed in the hair of no comet is heard ;
Which sendeth the soft sun, day by day,
Mighty, and genial, and just alway ;
Owning no difference, doing no wrong,
Loving the orbs and the least bird’s song ;
The great, sweet, warm angel with golden rod,
Bright with the smile of the distance of God.”
“ Indestructible souls among men
Were the souls of the line of Captain Pen ;
</p><p>Sages, patriots, martyrs mild
<lb/>Going to the stake, as child
<lb/>Goeth with his prayer to bed:</p><p></p><p>Dungeon-beams from quenchless head ;
<lb/>Poets making earth aware
<lb/>Of its wealth in good and fair.”</p><p></p><p>Are not these capital passages? You will enter with all
<lb/>your heart into what he says about fishing, and “Izaak.”
<lb/>“ Bodryddan” is dearly beautiful: it makes the reader feel</p><p>truly,	" That earth also is a star”
worthy of her
<pb n="24"/>
" That sat retired in reverend chair,
Fading heavenward beauteously
In a long-drawn life of love.”
There have been many good words about clocks and bells,
but these are memorable:—
</p><p>" Lost on the roof, a clock’s old grace
<lb/>Looked forth like some enchanted face
<lb/>That never slept, but in the night
<lb/>Dinted the air with thoughtful might
<lb/>Of sudden tongue, which seemed to say,</p><p>‘ The stars are firm and hold their way ’ ”
</p><p>“An Angel in the House,” “Songs of the Flowers,” are
<lb/>most choice. I thought I would have done with quoting, but
<lb/>here are two lines describing martyrdom, which I must co-
<lb break="no"/>py;—</p><p>" Now, now he gives the skies
The heart they gave (sweet thought 'gainst bitter wonders! )”
</p><p>There are some lines my fingers can scarcely resist, in
<lb/>“ To Kosciusko,” “ To the Author of Ion,” “Our Cottage,”
<lb/>“ Reflections of a Dead Body,” noble pieces. You will pick 
<lb/>them out.</p><p></p><p>Part of the revelling in a book of value is its evocation of
<lb/>wonders that lie in the past. Hunt’s beautiful illustrations
<lb/>of the “ Divine Mildness,” recalled Milton’s description of our
<lb/>unconscious diurnal revolution:</p><p></p><p>“ Or she from west her silent course advance
<lb/>With inoffensive pace, that spinning sleeps
<lb/>On her soft axle, while she paces even,</p><p>And bears thee soft with the smooth air along.”
</p><p>The “ One that sat Retired” in “ Bodryddan,” brought to
<lb/>mind a beautiful passage in a lecture of Hudson’s—that on
<lb/>“All’s Well that Ends Well.” The Countess Rousillon is
<lb/>to him, as he said, one of Shakspeare’s choicest fancies. It
<lb/>has a hold on his affections, reminding him of an ancient
<lb/>gentlewoman, “who was his friend in childhood, whose
<lb/>head had blossomed for the grave, and her heart for heaven;
<lb/>one to whom, if he had anything good he owed it. She told
<lb/>me,” he said, “ the story of the Babes in the Wood, the Cap-
<lb break="no"/>tivity of the Jews. I can never read of this Divine Countess
<lb/>without thinking of that heavenly old child.” At the closing
<lb/>words of this tender and beautiful sketch, a feeling burst of
<lb/>sympathy, delicately subdued, came from the audience.
<lb/>Gresset’s words were never more fit:—</p><p>Voir avec clairte,
Que l’homme n’est point fait pour la mechantete,
Consultez, ecoutez pour juges, pour oracles,
Les hommes rassembles ! voyez a nos spectacles,
Quand on peint quelque trait de candeur, de bonte,
Ou brille en tout son jour la tendre humanite,
Tous les coeurs son remplis d’une volupte pure,
Et c’est la qu’ on entend le cri de la nature.
What a lovely phrase, “heavenly old child”! Hunt avoids
both “ old lady” and “ old woman.”
</p><p>I am very glad you think with me as to walking in the
<lb/>fields with the children. I have heard you say, what is very
<lb/>just, “ how much more can be seen in a walk than a drive !”
<lb/>This excellent modem invention of gum-shoes enables the
<lb/>lady’s foot to reach the lovely marsh flowers. I have found
<lb/>lately improvement to all parts of my own nature from ram-
<lb break="no"/>bles in the woods and fields, and my attention has been
<lb/>turned more than ever to the beauty of flowers. I have been
<lb/>Steeped in poetry lately, turning over the American poets to
<lb/>enjoy the descriptions you allude to in one of your late let-
<lb break="no"/>ters. I am now sorry that my intended embellishments of
<lb/>wild flowers must leave behind the charm of their native
<lb/>haunts. These, may my children search annually all their
<lb/>lives! May every spring be to them, what it has been to
<lb/>me always a new spring ! May they see, time after time,
<lb/>what Bryant saw,</p><p>“ When violets lean
O’er wandering brooks and things unseen,
Or columbines in purple drest.
Nod o’er the ground-bird’s hidden nest.”
with Emerson—
“ Beneath dim aisles in odorous beds,
The slight Linnaea hangs its twin-born heads,
And bless the monument of the man of flowers,
Which breathes his sweet fame through the northern bowers.”
with Street,
“ Where its long rings uncurls the fern,
The violet, nestling low,
Casts back the white lid of its urn,
Its purple streaks to show.”
May they share his feelings, when he exclaims,
“ Beautiful blossom ! first to rise
And smile beneath Spring’s wakening skies,
</p><p>The courier of the band
<lb/>Of coming flowers, what feelings sweet
<lb/>Gush, as the silvery gem we meet
<lb/>Upon its slender wand !</p><p>Nor leave wandering for heat or cold, but see with Dana's
eyes delicate shadows embellish the expanse of snow.
</p><p>“ A lovely tracery
<lb/>Of branch aud twig, that naked tree
<lb/>Of shadows soft and dim has wove,</p><p></p><p>And spread so gently, that above
<lb/>The pure white snow it seems to float
<lb/>• ••••••</p><p>As if its darkening touch, through fear,
It held from thing so saintly dear”
</p><p>I was thanking you all the time for leading me this plea-
<lb break="no"/>sant road. It puzzles me, by the way, how Bryant can com-
<lb break="no"/>pare the gentian for color to the blue sky, since the blue is a
<lb/>great deal darker; but I explain it by supposing he meant
<lb/>that which grows in New York and south, which is, accord-
<lb break="no"/>ing to Pursh, of a paler tint. Our gentiana crinita does not
<lb/>I think express serenity, which it would, if it was of the
<lb/>shade of the blue sky. Are you an observer of the express-
<lb break="no"/>ion of flowers ? Burns, I suppose, considered the fox-glove
<lb/>as expressive of dignity when he said,</p><p>“ The stately fox-glove fair to see,”
and in that line,
</p><p>“ Wee, modest, crimson tipped flower.”
<lb/>doubtless he thought the low stature and rosy hue of the
<lb/>daisy denoted blushing humility. To go back in imagina-
<lb break="no"/>tion to June, the swamp honeysuckle seems to me the em-
<lb break="no"/>blem of a beautiful country woman. I do not mean one un-
<lb break="no"/>refined or illiterate, but full of naivete and careless graces,
<lb/>like that one-sided flower, delighting the eye with its heaped
<lb/>up cups and innocent whiteness.</p><p></p><p>The kalmialatifolia seems like a beautiful duchess elegant-
<lb break="no"/>ly dressed for a birthnight, yet with great precision, and with
<lb/>decorations very elaborate and angular.</p><p></p><p>Those plants which have a peculiar regularity of form, as
<lb/>the galeum, and lysimachia quadrifolia, for instance, awaken
<lb/>devotional feelings, as the hand of the divine architect seems
<lb/>so obvious in their structure. A pinnate leaf has a voice.</p><p></p><p>My brother has a patient now, (Mrs L.) whose recovery
<lb/>is retarded by excessively sombre religious views. I think
<lb/>it would have a tendency to cure her morbid fear of God, if
<lb/>in the proper season, she could wander in the fields as I do,
<lb/>and see the marmot eating grass, and then retreating to his
<lb/>subterraneous castle, and the caterpillar devouring in perfect
<lb/>peace the leaves of the milk-weed. If my brother’s unfor-
<lb break="no"/>tunate patient had seen the benevolence of God exercised to
<lb/>the animal creation, she would be very backward to con-
<lb break="no"/>clude He could be otherwise than loving to human beings.
<lb/>You would say perhaps, why not turn her attention to the
<lb/>past blessings of her own lot ? But that might not have so
<lb/>great a tendency to cure her dejection, because she has al-
<lb break="no"/>was been too sickly to enjoy much.</p><p><pb n="25"/>
</p><p>Henry says he observed two of my brother’s spruces re-
<lb break="no"/>cently, and from having just read Harris’s book, he was in-
<lb break="no"/>duced to search them for the false caterpillar, which he
<lb/>found, and relieved the trees of seventy. Henry says
<lb/>that Harris, for extending his protection over the trees, de-
<lb break="no"/>serves from the Dryads their fairest wreath. Pray suggest
<lb/>to James to examine our firs and pines.</p><p>And now my dear friend, guardian of my children, I bring
my long letter to an end with love to all.	E. M.
August, 184-.
</p><p>Dear Mrs. M :—The letter of mine, which failed to reach
<lb/>you, chiefly concerned Mary’s accident, but as you had an-
<lb break="no"/>other of the same date equally particular, it is an unimport-
<lb break="no"/>ant loss. James, who you know is always overrunning with
<lb/>kindness to Mary, taxes his invention continually to amuse
<lb/>her in her tedious confinement. This month of the cater-
<lb break="no"/>pillars, for the sake of the month of the butterflies, he has
<lb/>been looking up an old box and applying to me to furnish a
<lb/>gauze cover with a string. Then he set off to the china
<lb/>shop, where he procured a very little mug. This he filled
<lb/>with the leaves of the carrot, on which the caterpillars of the
<lb/>Asterias were feeding. The box was placed on Mary’s little
<lb/>table, where it forms one of her amusements. Besides these,
<lb/>he has introduced others, scanning every twig, and turning
<lb/>up all the leaves in the garden to add to the stock. As they
<lb/>are not very pretty creatures, in this stage of development,
<lb/>he brings Mary only the full grown, just in season to secure
<lb/>the fair sylph. Mary has a little book, in which she inserts
<lb/>the description of the larva, leaving the page opposite blank
<lb/>to receive the account of the creature in its perfect state. I
<lb/>like this process, independent of the recreation necessary in
<lb/>her present irksome condition. The habit of observation is
<lb/>formed, and what can be more salutary to the mind, more in
<lb/>harmony with itself, than to follow these divine processes?
<lb/>The remarkable developement of this tribe must, conscious-
<lb break="no"/>ly or unconsciously, keep alive the idea of personal improve-
<lb break="no"/>ment. I think it one of the most luminous pages of
<lb/>“ The book of God before (us) set.”</p><p></p><p>Mary is asking me to give up the pen to her. She thinks
<lb/>she can fill up what remains of my sheet though unable to
<lb/>complete a whole one, which she is discontented not to do,
<lb/>when she writes to her mother, if she begins one. I give it
<lb/>to her, meaning to continue my letter.</p><p></p><p>Dear Mother :—I long to see you, but that you know
<lb/>without my saying so, yet I love to write it. You do not
<lb/>know how kind James is to me. Yes, that you must guess
<lb/>at too. I hope I am improving, as I walk across the room
<lb/>with less difficulty every day. You recollect that bunch of
<lb/>the prettiest everlastings, that came up in the border last
<lb/>spring. James, you remember, wished to have it spared,
<lb/>as he says he likes even weeds, ever since he studied botany,
<lb/>but that ought not to be called a weed, should it ? James
<lb/>has been reading about all the gnaphaliums in North Ameri-
<lb break="no"/>ca, in Gray, and all over the world in Rees. He says he
<lb/>likes to know how many nations see the same flower. He
<lb/>complains very much of that Dr. Gray for making us wait so
<lb/>long for the rest of his book. But the everlasting, which I
<lb/>was going to tell you about; lately some caterpillars were
<lb/>found in webs on the top of the flowers. They ate the flor-
<lb break="no"/>ets, and the white scales coming loose hid the webs. When
<lb/>they grew large James brought them to me for my box that
<lb/>Mrs. — says she has been telling you about. They are black
<lb/>with stripes round, of yellow lines, spiny, with white dots in
<lb/>pairs. Mrs. M. tells me the butterfly comes out, after hang-</p><p></p><p>ing itself up, in about a fortnight, and is chiefly orange. I
<lb/>mean, dear mother, to send you a chrysalis. James says he
<lb/>has tried without success to rear the species you mentioned
<lb/>in your letter to him, but they are described in Harris, creep-
<lb break="no"/>ing and flying.</p><p></p><p>James has brought me a little flower-pot, full of earth for
<lb/>those that go into the ground. When they seem to be roam-
<lb break="no"/>ing round and have left off eating, I put them on the top of
<lb/>the earth and cover the pot with a gauze ; they go in, and in
<lb/>ten days, I pour out the earth carefully, pick up the chrysalis,
<lb/>and lay it on some cotton wool in a box, to stay till next
<lb/>spring ; then the pot is ready for another.</p><p>Yours, dearest mother,
Mary M.
</p><p>I begin anew, dear Mrs. M., as Mary has not filled the
<lb/>sheet. James' room I visited, and will give you an exact
<lb/>account. First, the top bed clothes were not turned over the
<lb/>foot board as you direct—the window was open but a crack,
<lb/>clothes changed lay on the floor instead of being put in the
<lb/>clothes-bag. James had been walking on the beach to ga-
<lb break="no"/>ther shells for Mary, and as he came home with his shoes
<lb/>full of sand, it was poured out on the carpet. The clothes
<lb/>that belonged in the wardrobe, were hanging, some over the
<lb/>foot-board of the bed, some were on chairs, shoes every-where,</p><p>the dressing-table——! I am glad you never wish me to find
</p><p>fault with your children, especially this most generous, kind-
<lb break="no"/>hearted little fellow. I do not know but my affection is deep
<lb/>enough to pull down, as it certainly is to build up with true
<lb/>satisfaction ; but you are right in thinking the best and most-
<lb break="no"/>beloved friend, is the most successful reformer. They will
<lb/>listen to you as Dante did to Beatrice.</p><p></p><p>You will like to hear of Alfred's punctuality. I received the
<lb/>quarterly money at breakfast time, the first day of the month.
<lb/>Indeed I was so sure of his faithfulness, I had promised to pay
<lb/>a debt of Joseph’s that morning; so Joseph and I were much
<lb/>relieved. Joseph hoped I should make him a short visit, as
<lb/>soon as the children’s vocation was finished,but I tell him he
<lb/>must wait till you return.</p><p></p><p>We went to see your friend Mrs. T. lately. She took us
<lb/> to the cemetery, which, in the newer parts, holds much I
<lb/>thought beautiful. One of the late enclosures within its
<lb/>hedge of thuga with its braided foliage, contained the trienta-
<lb break="no"/>lis, the uva ursi, various Solomon’s seals, the epigoea, the Mit-
<lb break="no"/>chelle, pyrolas of different species, most of the beautiful py-
<lb break="no"/>rola maculata, enough of andromudas and elethias to make a
<lb/>a necessary shade for the forest flowers. One, still later
<lb/>planted, was enclosed with privet : how beautiful for such
<lb/>a purpose, with its pure, white pyramidal tops of flowers
<lb/>brightening its night of green ! Within, were many neottias,
<lb/>whose sculpture-like, marbled leaves and spikes of white,
<lb/>look so monumental. Here were all the lycopodiums, the
<lb/>Linnoea, the gnaphalium margaritaceum, and a great variety
<lb/>of ferns. In both, brilliant colors were avoided, and foreign
<lb/>flowers—one of the last I wished for, the white rose. Why
<lb/>have not we a while rose, but why should we have every
<lb/>thing ? One colored flower was there: the witch hazel, the
<lb/>autumn flower of whose leafless branches is almost as
<lb/>beautiful an illustration of the immortal creature as the but-
<lb break="no"/>terfly. The monument in each of these enclosures was em-
<lb break="no"/>bellished by a beautiful design from Retsch’s Hamlet, one
<lb/>by the angel keeping watch at the gate of the omb, and the
<lb/>other by the Psyche striving heavenwards. With some want
<lb/>of good taste, a butterfly, extricating itself from the sheath,</p><p>was carved on Capt. ——stone. James, who has been
drawing a good deal lately, and become very dexterous,
 drew with his pencil upon the marble, a beetle emerging
<pb n="26"/>
</p><p>from the earth ; however, when his back was turned, I suc-
<lb break="no"/>ceeded in effacing the lines. You once enlightened me on
<lb/>the falsity of contempt. I was always repelled by its ill-na-
<lb break="no"/>ture. In the morning, James had been, as you might expect</p><p>from his sweet disposition, quite annoyed with B—— for
</p><p>eyeing affectedly, in an indolent way, through the ring of a
<lb/>whip he had in his hand, a negro girl who was passing, and
<lb/>after we got home, I tried to make out his case to be the
<lb/>same thing, thoughnot so obvious .Now, said I, that clumsy
<lb/>form was the temple of a soul, and glorified by it, as the
<lb/>meanest hovel is ennobled by having a bible in it. The cap-
<lb break="no"/>tain did not look more unpromising, than the blunt, clumsy
<lb/>black chrysalis of the lonely luna-moth. Ah! my friend, you
<lb/>are no intellectual Swammerdamm!</p><p>Dear lady, yours,
N. S.
Alfred Tennyson
</p><p>We do not know when we have seen in any American or
<lb/>British Journal an article we have so much admired, or one
<lb/>with whose opinions we have so thoroughly accorded, as
<lb/>with a late review, by Mr. Whipple, of Mr. Griswold’s
<lb/>“ Poets and Poetry of the Nineteenth Century.” The paper
<lb/>appeared in the last number of the whig Magazine. We
<lb/>extract some passages relating to Tennyson. They seem to
<lb/>us the very echo of thoughts which hitherto we have had an
<lb/>opportunity of expressing only in conversation. The injus-
<lb break="no"/>tice done in America to the magnificent genius of Tennyson
<lb/>is one of the worst sins for which the country has to answer.</p><p></p><p>Of all the successors of Shelley, he possesses the most sureness of
<lb/>insight. He has a subtle mind, a keen, passionless vision. His
<lb/>poetry is characterized by intellectual intensity, as distinguished
<lb/>from the intensity of feeling. He watches his consciousness with
<lb/>a cautious and minute attention, to fix, and condense, and shape in-
<lb break="no"/>to form, the vague and mystical shadows of thought and feeling,
<lb/>which glide and flit across it. He listens to catch the lowest whis-
<lb break="no"/>perings of the soul. His imagination broods over the spiritual and
<lb/>mystical elements of his being, with the most concentrated power.
<lb/>His eye rests firmly oif an object, until it changes from film into
<lb/>form. Some of his poems are forced into artistical shape, by the
<lb/>most patient and painful intellectual processes. His utmost
<lb/>strength is employed on those mysterious facts of consciousness,
<lb/>which form the staple of the dreams and reveries of others. His
<lb/>mind winds through the mystical labyrinths of thought and feeling,
<lb/>with every power awake, in action, and wrought up to the highest
<lb/>pitch of intensity. The most acute analysis is followed, step by
<lb/>step, by a suggestive imagination, which converts refined abstrac-
<lb break="no"/>tions into pictures, or makes them audible to the soul through the
<lb/>most cunning combinations of sound. Everything that is done is
<lb/>the result of labor. There is hardly a stanza in his writings, but
<lb/>was introduced to serve some particular purpose, and could not be
<lb/>omitted without injury to the general effect. Every thing has mean-
<lb break="no"/>ing. Every idea was won in a fair conflict with darkness, or dis-
<lb break="no"/>sonance, or gloom. The simplicity, the barrenness of ornament, in
<lb/>some of his lines, are as much the result of contrivance as his most
<lb/>splendid images. With what labor, for instance, with what atten-
<lb break="no"/>tive watching of consciousness, must the following stanza have been
<lb/>wrought into shape:</p><p>“ All those sharp fancies, by down-lapsing thought
Stream’d onward, lost their edges, and did creep,
Roll’d on each other, rounded, smooth’d and brought
Into the gulfs of sleep.”
</p><p>This intense intellectual action is displayed in his delineations of
<lb/>nature and individual character, as well as in his subjective gross-
<lb break="no"/>ings into the refinements of his own consciousness. In describing
<lb/>scenery, his microscopic eye and marvellously delicate ear, are ex-
<lb break="no"/>ercised to the utmost in detecting the minutest relations and most
<lb/>evanescent melodies of the objects before him, in order that his re-
<lb break="no"/>presentation of it shall include everything which is important to its
<lb/>full perception. His pictures of English rural scenery, among the
<lb/>finest in the language, give the inner spirit as well as the outward
<lb/>form of the objects, and represent them, also, in their relation to
<lb/>the mind which is gazing on them ; but nothing is spontaneous; the
<lb/>whole is wrought out elaborately by patient skill. The picture in
<lb/>his mind is spread out before his detecting and dissecting intellect,
<lb/>to be transferred to words, only when it can be done with the most
<lb/>refined exactness, both as regards color, and form and melody. He
<lb/>takes into calculation the nature of his subject, and decides wheth-</p><p></p><p>er it shall be definitely expressed in images, or indefinitely
<lb/>through tone, or whether both modes shall be combined. His ob-
<lb break="no"/>ject is expression, in its true sense; to reproduce in other minds
<lb/>the imagination or feeling which lies in his own ; and he adopts the
<lb/>method which seems best calculated to effect it. He never will
<lb/>trust himself to the impulses of passion, even in describing passion.
<lb/>All emotion, whether turbulent or evanescent, is passed through
<lb/>his intellect, and curiously scanned. To write furiously, would to
<lb/>him appear as ridiculous, and as certainly productive of confusion,
<lb/>as to paint furiously, or carve furiously. We only appreciate his
<lb/>art, when we consider that many of his finest conceptions and most
<lb/>sculptural images, originally appeared in his consciousness as form-
<lb break="no"/>less and mysterious emotions, having seemingly no symbols in na-
<lb break="no"/>ture or thought.</p><p></p><p>If our position is correct, then most certainly nothing can be
<lb/>more incorrect than to call any poem of Tennyson’s unmeaning.
<lb/>Such a charge simply implies a lack in the critic’s mind, not in the
<lb/>poet’s. The latter always means something, in everything he
<lb/>writes; and the form which it is embodied is chosen with the most
<lb/>careful deliberation. It seems to us that the purely intellectual ele-
<lb break="no"/>ment in Tennyson’s poetry, has been overlooked, owing perhaps to
<lb/>the fragility of some of his figures and the dreariness of outline ap-
<lb break="no"/>parent in others. Many think him to be a mere rhapsodist, fertile
<lb/>in nothing but a kind of melodious empiricism. No opinion is
<lb/>more contradicted by the fact. Examine his poetry minutely, and
<lb/>the wonderful artistical finish becomes evident. There are few
<lb/>authors who will bear the probe of analysis better.</p><p></p><p>The poetry of Tennyson is, moreover, replete with magnificent
<lb/>pictures, flushed with the finest hues of language, and speaking to
<lb/>the eye and the mind with the vividness of reality. We not only
<lb/>see the object, but feel the associations connected with it. His
<lb/>language is penetrated with imagination ; and the felicity of his
<lb/>epithets leaves nothing to desire. “ Godiva” is perfect as regards
<lb/>taste and the skill evinced in compelling the mind of the reader to
<lb/>sympathize with all the emotions of the piece. Like the generality
<lb/>of Tennyson’s poems, though short, it contains elements of interest
<lb/>capable of being expanded into a much larger space. But the poem
<lb/>which probably displays to the best advantage his variety of power,
<lb/>is “ The Gardener's Daughter.” It is flushed throughout with the
<lb/>most ethereal imagination, though the incidents and emotions come
<lb/>home to the common heart, and there is little appearance of elabo-
<lb break="no"/>ration in the style. It is bathed in beauty—perfect as a whole, and
<lb/>finished in the nicest details with consummate art. There is s seem-
<lb break="no"/>ing copiousness of expression with a real condensation; and the
<lb/>most minute threads of thought and feeling,—so refined as to be
<lb/>overlooked in a careless reading, yet all having relation to the gen-
<lb break="no"/>eral effect,—are woven into the texture of the style, with the most
<lb/>admirable felicity. “ Locksley Hall,” Aenone,” “ The May
<lb/>Queen,” “Ulysses,” “ The Lot s Eaters,” “ The Lady of Shalott.’’
<lb/>“ Marianna,” “ Dora,” " The Two Voices,” “ The Dream of Fair
<lb/>Women,” “ The Palace of Art,” all different, all representing a pe-
<lb break="no"/>culiar phase of nature or character, are still all characterized by the
<lb/>cunning workmanship of a master of expression, giving the most
<lb/>complete form to the objects which his keen vision perceives. The
<lb/>melody of verse, which distinguishes all, ranging from the deepest
<lb/>organ tones to that</p><p>" Music which gentlier on the spirit lies,
</p><p>Than tired eyelids upon tired eyes,”
<lb/>is also of remarkable beauty, and wins and winds its way to the
<lb/>very fountains of thought and feeling.</p><p>Young America.
</p><p>Regretting the necessity of employing a phrase which is
<lb/>not only borrowed, but redolent of affectation, we still have
<lb/>the most earnest sympathy in all the hopes, and the firmest
<lb/>faith in the capabilities of “ Young America.” We look upon
<lb/>its interests as our own, and shall uniformally uphold them in
<lb/>this Journal. What these interests are—what should be the
<lb/>aspirations of the new men of the country, and of the country
<lb/>through them in especial, it has been our intention to express
<lb/>fully in our own words, at the first convenient opportunity—but
<lb/>we have now lying before us an address which embodies all
<lb/>that there is any necessity for saying.</p><p></p><p>We allude to a paper read by Mr. Cornelius Mathews
<lb/>at the late annual meeting of the Eucleian Society of the
<lb/>University of New York. We shall be pardoned for making
<lb/>some extracts:</p><p></p><p>I do take it for granted, Gentlemen, that there are some new in-
<lb break="no"/>fluences to be represented in Literature by the authors of this coun-
<lb break="no"/>try. I am foolish enough to believe and insist that we are a pro-
<lb break="no"/>vince to no other country on the face of the world. I therefore, in</p><p><pb n="27"/>
</p><p>behalf of this young America of ours, insist on nationality and true
<lb/>Americanism in the books this country furnishes to itself and to the
<lb/>world : nationality in its purest, highest, broadest sense. Not such
<lb/>as is proclaimed in taverns, ranted of in Congress, or made the occa-
<lb break="no"/>sion of boasting and self-laudation on public anniversaries. It need
<lb/>not (though it may ) speak of the Revolution—nor Washington—nor
<lb/>the declaration of independence—nor Plymouth Rock—nor Bunker
<lb/>Hill, Nor Bunker Mill Monument. And yet it may be instinct with
<lb/>the life of the country, full of a hearty, spontaneous, genuine home
<lb/>feeling; relishing of the soil and of the spirit of the people. It will
<lb/>not be petty, I can assure you: in poetry, the echo of effete and
<lb/>by-gone English schools, nor in history, the re-production of French
<lb/>rhetoric, nor in humor, the popular authors of the time in another
<lb/>country. It will not, in a word, grow cross-eyed with straining its
<lb/>vision on models, three thousand miles away, while it makes a show
<lb/>of busying itself with a subject spread on the desk before it. If I
<lb/>read aright, the journals and periodicals of this country begin to
<lb/>indicate a weariness of the petty standards, by which they have
<lb/>been accustomed to measure and adjudge books of home production :
<lb/>to be dissatisfied with the mere elegance in writing which has been
<lb/>the prevailing demand and fashion of our literature. They feel that
<lb/>here is a giant speaking in a piping treble, and dancing a child’s
<lb/>hornpipe, to the universal contempt and mockery of the world.
<lb/>The writings of a great country should sound of the great voices
<lb/>of nature of which she is full. The march of a great people in
<lb/>literature should be majestic and assured as the action of their in-
<lb break="no"/>stitution is calm and secure. The discovery begins to be made that
<lb/>the life of a young Continent is not to be represented, nor its heart
<lb/>moved, by tinkling rhymers and sketches with sparrow's quills. It
<lb/>is not necessary to enter, now, upon causes which have kept us in
<lb/>servitude so long to men not worthy of us; nor to show why it is
<lb/>that you may wander through whole bodies and collections of (so
<lb/>called) American literature, and find no word or verse worthy of the
<lb/>nation. The cause (allowing duly for the absence of great indivi-
<lb break="no"/>dual genius) must at least be general, which produces so constant
<lb/>and melancholy a uniformity of result. In the drama the people
<lb/>begin to exhibit a like weariness and aversion to the constant itera-
<lb break="no"/>tion and re-iteration of plays written for another people, another
<lb/>state of society, and to speak not unfairly, in many of the true ele-
<lb break="no"/>ments of manhood and progress, far behind ourselves. That spirit
<lb/>which disdains defeat in war, in commerce or in science, cannot
<lb/>much longer rest content with an iguominious vassalage in litera-
<lb break="no"/>ture. The mere growth of the country will burst the bonds, and
<lb/>leave it free to re-assume the vigorous step of a country yet in its
<lb/>prime. Here in New York, is the seat and strong hold of this
<lb/>young power : but, all over the land, day by day, new men are
<lb/>emerging into activity: who partake of these desires, who scorn
<lb/>and despise the past pettiness of the country, and who are ready to
<lb/>sustain any movement towards a better and nobler condition.</p><p></p><p>They contend for home-writers, home-writings, and home criti-
<lb break="no"/>cism: and it is their belief that the world is yet to receive at the
<lb/>hands of the authors of America works which it will be willing to
<lb/>add to its catalogue of illustrious influences; to Homer and Dante,
<lb/>Shakapeare and Milton, and whoever else has laboured in the broad
<lb/>bold of human nature building on a base of sure good sense, and
<lb/>embracing in a catholic spirit all that is good and of good influence</p><p></p><p>in all the world; drawing it home to their native land in a true na-
<lb break="no"/>tionality, and returning it again to the world that gave it to bless,
<lb/>and cheer, and purify all mankind. It is not a vain desire, I hope,
<lb/>that we may yet live to see the world waiting the steps of authors,
<lb/>of our own, watching the motions of their spirit, and hanging on the
<lb/>birth of their labors : as of men who make a part of their daily
<lb/>pleasure and happiness, as they do now of ours.</p><p></p><p>And in art, shall we not have schools of our own ? Partaking of
<lb/>the climate, the rocks, the woodlands, the rivers and the human
<lb/>faces of our own country ? Chosen from what ever region of the
<lb/>world the subjects may he, will there not be something in the
<lb/>form and spirit, in the skill and kind of execution, to inform us that
<lb/>their origin is in the American heart and the American genius ? I
<lb/>Would not here, any more than in the writing of books, restrict the
<lb/>artist to parallels of latitude and longitude ; nor insist that his sub-
<lb break="no"/>jects be American, even in name. But what am I to think of a
<lb/>country whose very caricatures—the little pieces illustrative of the
<lb/>great national incident of the election of a President—are made up
<lb/>from the odds and ends of English designers : as though we were
<lb/>made thankful for the crumbs and ends of dry crust that drop from
<lb/>the table of a master and superior. A stranger visiting us might
<lb/>argue against our character, with almost irresistible success, from
<lb/>that single circumstance. A people whose mirth—in a question
<lb/>where all are ready to think for themselves, and laugh for them-
<lb break="no"/>selves, one would suppose,—is the charity gift of foreigners. There
<lb/>is room and occasion—no more room, no better occasion, any
<lb/>where in the world—for a school of comic design, here in New
<lb/>York, which shall be truly national, characteristic, and emi-
<lb break="no"/>nently successful. I have not yet had the good fortune to en-
<lb break="no"/>counter a single person capable of a respectable performance in this
<lb/>way although I am told there are such.</p><p>In sculpture, and some departments of painting, we have already
accomplished something in the true spirit of Young America, and
</p><p>the world is ready to acknowledge it. But in another province of
<lb/>art, that of engraving,, we have played the copyist and servant with a
<lb/>vengeance. For fifty years, at least, I take it, the whole force of
<lb/>engravers of the United States has been employed in the dilligent
<lb/>imitation and copying and re-production of worn-out and cast-off
<lb/>plates of France and England. There are a few examples of cred-
<lb break="no"/>itable effort annually ; but the eye for the long intervals between,
<lb/>is pained and wounded by the saddest parodies and extravaganzas,
<lb/>in steel, and copper, and wood. And in music are we never to have
<lb/>melodies that shall fix us with links, invisible, yet stronger than
<lb/>steel, to our native land; whose sounds swelling over the sea as
<lb/>we draw near, or chaunted in far lands, away from home, or sound-
<lb break="no"/>ing here at our own firesides, shall awaken in us every tender, and
<lb/>pleasing, remembrance of this dear country that is ours? You see
<lb/>the spirit of what I am attempting to enforce? The business of
<lb/>Young America in this regard, is then, as I understand it, to nourish,
<lb/>and encourage, and sustain, by a harmonious combination of all the
<lb/>true young influences, the manly young writers of the country:</p><p></p><p>A Home Literature, national, vigorous, of the soil and the spirit
<lb/>of the people : and a popular press, ready to sustain it and itself, by
<lb/>showing that it is worthy to form the guide and the friend of the
<lb/>country, through which, and to which, it speaks ;</p><p></p><p>National Drama, free of the conventionalities, abuses, and false
<lb/>usages of the stages of the old world ; a drama, which all Americans
<lb/>of all classes, without distinction of sect or party, may attend not
<lb/>only without wound or dishonor, but to be moved, and made proud
<lb/>and glad by pictures and appeals true to their own experience, and
<lb/>to that which they, as Americans, desire and long for;</p><p></p><p>Schools of Art in Portraiture, Humor, History-Painting, Sculp-
<lb break="no"/>ture, Music, which shall grow like these out of the national spirit,
<lb/>elevating and enlivening our daily life : making mirth,and similitude,
<lb/>and enduring forms of that which we know to be true, and worthy,
<lb/>and our own.</p><p></p><p>And to further these objects : to bring on their accomplishment
<lb/>speedily and happily, let me counsel perfect union and harmony
<lb/>among this young brotherhood ; let every writer and every man
<lb/>having an influence in art and literature, look upon his fellow-la-
<lb break="no"/>borer as his brother. Let him insist that he shall be respected, and
<lb/>that his labor be worthily rewarded. Let such as are the auxilia-
<lb break="no"/>ries of literature and art, be given to understand that the writer and
<lb/>the artist is something in the nature of a Principal in transactions
<lb/>relating to his craft, and that he will and must he dealt with as
<lb/>such. Let him demand his station among men, and let men know
<lb/>that, one of the ruling powers of the world, will not have his wea-
<lb break="no"/>pon of authority made, when out of actual service, a scourge for
<lb/>his degradation and overthrow.</p><p></p><p>United, the authors and artists of America, the unelected, but self-
<lb break="no"/>sustained governors of a free people, will be the noblest body, the
<lb/>manliest phalanx that walks the earth ; at the head of a movement,
<lb/>to whose march the whole world will, ere long, be beating joyful

Wiley and Putnam s Library of Choice Reading. No. XIII.
The Age of Elizabeth. By William Hazlitt.
</p><p>We cannot help regarding the thorough success of Wiley
<lb/>and Putnam’s Library of Choice Reading, as the harbinger
<lb/>of a better day for the interest of American Letters. It has
<lb/>at length been fairly shown, that not only our educated
<lb/>classes, but our public at large, will purchase, and have ca-
<lb break="no"/>pacity to enjoy, a kind of books immeasurably superior, in all
<lb/>that renders a book valuable, to the species of literature
<lb/>with which we have been latterly deluged.</p><p></p><p>The experiment of fine paper, well-sized type, and a taste-
<lb break="no"/>ful form of getting up generally, has been attempted, and
<lb/>not in vain. The day of “cheap literature” is, we thank
<lb/>Heaven, happily over; and for this much-desired result it is
<lb/>difficult to say how much we are indebted, or rather how
<lb/>much we are not indebted, to the liberality and good judg-
<lb break="no"/>ment of Messrs. Wiley &amp; Putnam. To have failed in this
<lb/>enterprise would have been to throw us back for several years
<lb/>into the quagmire of the yellow-backed pamphleteering. Of
<lb/>course a great deal depended upon the tact with which books
<lb/>for the series were selected. There was a juste milieu to be
<lb/>attained—a happy medium between the stilted and jejune</p><p>—between the ponderous and the ephemeral. Works were
required of a piquancy to render them at once popular, (for
<pb n="28"/>
</p><p>the immediate and extensive sale of the Library was indis-
<lb break="no"/>pensible) and at the same time, of a gravity which would en-
<lb break="no"/>able them to make their way as volumes not only sufficient
<lb/>ly well gotten up, but of a sufficiently standard character to
<lb/>warrant their preservation in our book-cases. This difficult
<lb/>task fell into the best hands; and the result has been one
<lb/>whose importance to the present interest of literature in
<lb/>America, can scarcely be overrated. Booksellers in this
<lb/>country have a trick of as implicitly following a good lead,
<lb/>as did les moutons de Panurge, and we fancy that we al-
<lb break="no"/>ready perceive, in all quarters, a disposition to prosecute the
<lb/>good work of readable books, so auspiciously commenced.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps the very best, although not the last volume, of the
<lb/>European series, is No. XIII—“ Lectures on the Dramatic
<lb/>Literature of the Age of Elizabeth, by William Hazlitt."</p><p></p><p>It is indeed a rich work. We cannot, to be sure, agree
<lb/>with some of its author’s admirers, in calling him “ The best
<lb/>critic which England has produced in the nineteenth cen-
<lb break="no"/>tury,” for in almost every point, except the vivida vis of glow-
<lb break="no"/>ing fancy, we look upon him as the inferior of Macaulay—a
<lb/>man who, if he has not written the best criticisms ever penn-
<lb break="no"/>ed, has at least shown the capacity to write them ;—but
<lb/>we would rank him next to Macaulay, and very far before
<lb/>Leigh Hunt, who was a dexterous but unanalytical, and some-
<lb break="no"/>what confused prosodist—or Charles Lamb, who thought
<lb/>brilliantly, and never troubled himself with thinking if he
<lb/>thought to any purpose—or Wilson who always considered
<lb/>himself most honest when he was the fullest of prejudice,
<lb/>and who had cultivated rhodomontade into a passion. Of
<lb/>Jeffrey and Gifford we say nothing—for between these men
<lb/>and Hazlitt there are no points of approximation and they
<lb/>cannot be compared.</p><p></p><p>The criticisms of the latter are, we think, his best compo-
<lb break="no"/>sitions :—his best book is “The Age of Elizabeth.” Upon
<lb/>the whole he is singularly vivid, forceful, acute, discrimina-
<lb break="no"/>tive, and suggestive. His honesty is wonderful in an age of
<lb/>dishonesty. His courage is very well as things go. His
<lb/>judgment is never for one moment to be depended upon in
<lb/>any connected or consecutive series of opinions. He is often
<lb/>profound—but his profundity is invariably detailed or parti-
<lb break="no"/>cular.</p><p>We quote a few highly characteristic passages from his
disquisition on the Get man Drama :
</p><p>“ I have half trifled with this subject: and I believe I have done so
<lb/>because I despaired of finding language for some old rooted feelings
<lb/>I have about it, which a theory could never give nor can it take
<lb/>away. ‘ The Robbers’ was the first play I ever read : and the ef-
<lb break="no"/>fect produced upon me was the greatest. It stunned me like a
<lb/>blow, and I have not recovered enough from it to describe how it
<lb/>was. There are impressions which neither time nor circumstances
<lb/>can efface. Were I to live much longer thau I have any chance of
<lb/>doing, the books which I rend when I wus young I can never for-
<lb break="no"/>get. Twenty years have elapsed since I first read a translation of
<lb/>‘ The Robbers,' but they have not blotted the impression from my
<lb/>mind : it is here still, an old dweller in the chambers of the brain.
<lb/>The scene in particular in which Moor looks through his tears at
<lb/>the evening sun from the mountain’s brow, and says in his despair,
<lb/>“ It was my wish like him to live, like him to die: it was au idle
<lb/>thought, a boy's conceit,' took last hold of my imagination, and that
<lb/>sun has to me never set! The last interview in ‘ Don Carlos' be-
<lb break="no"/>tween the two lovers, in which the injured bride struggles to burst
<lb/>the prison-house of her destiny, in which her hopes and youth lie
<lb/>confined, and buried, as it were, alive, under the opposition of un-
<lb break="no"/>speakable anguish, I remember gave me a deep sense of suffering
<lb/>and a strong desire after good, which has haunted me ever since.
<lb/>I do not like Schiller’s late style so well. His ' Wallenstein,’
<lb/>which is admirably and almost literally translated by Mr. Cole-
<lb break="no"/>ridge, is stately, thoughtful, and imaginative: bnt where is the en-
<lb break="no"/>thusiasm, the throbbing of hope and fear, the mortal struggle be-
<lb break="no"/>tween the passions: as if all happiness or misery of a life were
<lb/>crowded into a moment, and the die was to be cast at that instant ?
<lb/>Gotzebue’s best work I read first in Cumberland's imitation of it in
<lb/>The Wheel of Fortune,’ and I confess that that style of sentiment
<lb/>which seems to make of life itself a long-drawn endless sigh, has</p><p></p><p>something in it that pleases me, in spite of rules and criticism.
<lb/>Goethe's tragedies are (those that I have seen of them, his ' Count
<lb/>Edmont,' ‘ Stella, ’&amp;c.) constructed upon the second or diverted man-
<lb break="no"/>ner of the German stage, with a deliberate design to avoid all pos-
<lb break="no"/>sible effect and interest, and this object is completely accomplished.
<lb/>He is however spoken of with enthusiasm almost amounting to
<lb/>idolatry by his countrymen, and those among ourselves who import
<lb/>heavy German criticism into this country in shallow, flat-bottomed
<lb/>unwieldy intellects. Madame de Stael speaks of one passage in
<lb/>his ‘ Iphigenia,’ where he introduces a fragment of an old song,
<lb/>which the Furies are supposed to sing to Tantalus in Hell, reproach-
<lb break="no"/>ing him with the times when he sat with the Gods at their golden
<lb/>tables, and with his after-crimes that hurled him from heaven, at
<lb/>which he turns his eyes from his children and hangs his head in
<lb/>mournful silence. This is the true sublime. Of all his works I
<lb/>I like his ' Werter' best, nor would I part with it at a venture, even
<lb/>for the ‘ Memoirs of Anastasius the Greek,’ whoever is the author;
<lb/>nor ever cease to think of the times, “ when in the fine summer
<lb/>evenings they saw the frank, noble-minded enthusiast coming up
<lb/>from the valley,” nor of “ the high grass that by the light of the
<lb/>departing sun waved in the breeze over his grave.”</p><p></p><p>Orthophony: or Vocal Culture in Elocution ; a Manual of

<lb/>the authors in a well-written Preface, “ is to furnish the

<lb break="no"/>vation of the voice.” We have looked through the work
<lb/>with great interest, and believe it to be the best American
<lb/>treatise on the subject discussed. There are some passages,
<lb/>(relating chiefly to metre), with which we totally disagree,
<lb/>and of which we may take an opportunity of speaking more
<lb/>fully hereafter—but in general the book appears to us re-
<lb break="no"/>markably accurate and valuable. The elocutionary abilities
<lb/>of Mr. Murdoch arc of a high order. We rejoice to learn

<lb break="no"/>ment. Fourthly, there is an accented list of 15,000 Greek,

</p><p>Mrs. Mowatt, at Niblo’s, has been the great theatrical
<lb/>attraction of the week. She has been very successful, drew
<lb/>large and fashionable as well as intellectual audiences, and
<lb/>elicited boisterous applause, with much of a kind less equi-
<lb break="no"/>vocal.</p><p></p><p>She has erred, we think, in making this arrangement—
<lb/>that is to say, she has somewhat injured the prestige of her
<lb/>name, first in appearing at a summer theatre, and secondly
<lb/>in appearing again at all after so brief an interval. Mrs.
<lb/>Mowatt owes it to herself to maintain a certain dignity ; and,
<lb/>although this certain dignity be preposterous, in fact in the
<lb/>fiction of the world's view it is all important. A lady so
<lb/>well-connected, and so well established in the public eye by
<lb/>her literary reputation, could have had no difficulty in coming
<lb/>upon the stage in her own fashion, and almost on her own
<lb/>terms. The Park, as the place of her debut, was, of course,
<lb/>unobjectionable, although in a negative sense. She lost no
<lb/>caste by coming out here, but the fact cannot be disputed
<lb/>that she would have gained much by first appearing in Lon-
<lb break="no"/>don, and presenting herself to her countrymen and country-
<lb break="no"/>women with the eclat of a foreign reputation. We say this,
<lb/>with a bitter sense of our national degradation, and subser-
<lb break="no"/>viency to British opinion:—we say it, moreover, with a con-
<lb break="no"/>sciousness that Mrs. Mowatt should not have done this thing
<lb/>however much it would have furthered her interests.</p><p></p><p>On another point she has beyond doubt acted unwisely.
<lb/>Mr. Crisp is in many respects an excellent actor, but he is by
<lb/>no means of that degree of eminence which we should have
<lb/>desired in the supporter of Mrs. Mowatt. With Mr. Forrest
<lb/>she would have had advantages which can never be afforded
<lb/>her by Mr. Crisp.</p><p></p><p>We have no sympathies with the prejudices which would
<lb/>entirely have dissuaded Mrs. Mowatt from the stage. There
<lb/>is no cant more contemptible than that which habitually de-
<lb break="no"/>cries the theatrical profession—a profession which, in itself,
<lb/>embraces all that can elevate and ennoble, and absolutely
<lb/>nothing to degrade. If some—if many—or if even nearly all
<lb/>of its members are dissolute, this is an evil arising not from
<lb/>the profession itself, but from the unhappy circumstances
<lb/>which surround it. With these circumstances Mrs. Mowatt
<lb/>has, at present, no concern. With talents, enthusiasm, and
<lb/>energy, she will both honor the stage and derive from it ho-
<lb break="no"/>nor. In the mere name of actress she can surely find nothing
<lb/>to dread—nothing, or she would be unworthy of the profes-
<lb break="no"/>sion—not the profession unworthy her. The theatre is en-
<lb break="no"/>nobled by its high facilities for the development of genius—
<lb/>facilities not afforded elsewhere in equal degree. By the
<lb/>spirit of genius, we say, it is ennobled—it is sanctified—be-
<lb break="no"/>yond the sneer of the foul or the cant of the hypocrite. The
<lb/>actor of talent is poor at heart indeed, if he do not look with
<lb/>contempt upon the mediocrity even of a king. The writer
<lb/>of this article is himself the son of an actress—has invariably
<lb/>made it his boast—and no earl was ever prouder of his earl-
<lb break="no"/>dom than he of his descent from a woman who, although
<lb/>well-born, hesitated not to consecrate to the drama her brief
<lb/>career of genius and of beauty.</p><p>At Niblo’s, as at the Park, Mrs. Mowatt made her first appear-
</p><p>ance as Pauline, in “The Lady of Lyons;” and this is the
<lb/>only character she has yet sustained. On the play itself we
<lb/>have lately seen some strictures which seem to us unjust.
<lb/>We regard it as one of the most successful dramatic efforts of
<lb/>modern times. It is popular, and justly so. It could not
<lb/> fail to be popular so long as the people have a heart. It
<lb/>abounds with sentiments which stir the soul as the sound of
<lb/>a trumpet. It proceeds rapidly, and consequentially : the
<lb/>interest not for one moment being permitted to flag. Its in-
<lb break="no"/>cidents are admirably conceived, and wrought into execution
<lb/>with great skill. Its dramatis personae throughout, have the
<lb/>high merit of being natural, although, except in the case of
<lb/>Pauline, there is no marked individuality. She is a creation
<lb/>which would have done no dishonor to Shakspeare—and she
<lb/>excites in us the most profound emotion. It has been sillily
<lb/>objected to her that she is weak, mercenary, and at points
<lb/>ignoble. She is—and what then? We are not dealing with
<lb/>Clarissa Harlowe. Bulwer wished to paint a woman, and
<lb/>has done so. The principal defect of the play lies in the he-
<lb break="no"/>roine’s consenting to wed Beauseant, while aware of the ex-
<lb break="no"/>istence and even of the continued love of Claude. As the plot
<lb/>runs, there is a question in Pauline’s soul between a compa-
<lb break="no"/>ratively trivial, because mere worldly, injury to her father,
<lb/>and utter ruin and despair inflicted upon her husband. Here
<lb/>there should have been not an instant’s hesitation. The au-
<lb break="no"/>dience have no sympathy with any. Nothing on earth should
<lb/>have induced the wife to give up the living Melnotte. Only
<lb/>the assurance of his death could have justified her in sacri-
<lb break="no"/>ficing herself to Beauseant. As it is we hate her for the
<lb/>sacrifice. The effect is repulsive—at war with the whole
<lb/>genius of the play.</p><p></p><p>Of Mrs. Mowatt, and of her acting, we have to speak on-
<lb break="no"/>ly in terms of enthusiastic admiration. We have never had
<lb/>the pleasure of seeing her before—and we presume that there
<lb/>are many of our readers who have never seen her. Her
<lb/>figure is slight—even fragile—but eminently graceful. Her
<lb/>face is a remarkably fine one, and of that precise character
<lb/>best adapted to the stage. The forehead is the least prepos-
<lb break="no"/>sessing feature, although it is by no means an unintellectual
<lb/>one. The eyes are grey, brilliant, and expressive, without
<lb/>being full. The nose is well formed, with the Roman
<lb/>curve, and strongly indicative of energy ; this quality is also
<lb/>shown in the prominence of the chin. The mouth is some-
<lb break="no"/>what large, with brilliant and even teeth, and flexible lips,
<lb/>capable of the most effective variations of expression. A
<lb/>more radiantly beautiful smile we never remember having
<lb/>seen. Mrs. Mowatt has also the personal advantage of a
<lb/>profusion of rich auburn hair.</p><p></p><p>Her manner on the stage is distinguished by an ease and
<lb/>self-possession which would do credit to a veteran. Her
<lb/>step is very graceful and assured—indeed all her movements
<lb/>evince the practised elocutionist. We watched her with the
<lb/>closest scrutiny throughout the whole play, and not for one
<lb/> instant did we observe her in an attitude of the least awk-
<lb break="no"/>wardness, or even constraint, while many of her seemingly
<lb/>impulsive gestures spoke in loud terms of the woman of ge-
<lb break="no"/>nius—of the poet deeply imbued with the truest sentiment of
<lb/>the beauty of motion.</p><p></p><p>Her voice is rich and voluminous, and although by no
<lb/>means powerful, is so well managed as to seem so. Her ut-
<lb break="no"/>terance is singularly distinct—its sole blemish being an oc-
<lb break="no"/>casional Anglicism of accent, adopted probably from her in-
<lb break="no"/>structor. Her reading could scarcely be improved. In this
<lb/>respect no actress in America is her equal—for she reads not
<lb/>theatrically, but with the emphasis of Nature. Indeed the
<lb/>great charm of the whole acting of Mrs. Mowatt is its natu-</p><p><pb n="30" break="no" />
</p><p>ralness. She moves, looks, and speaks with a well-control-
<lb break="no"/>led impulsiveness as can be conceived from the customary
<lb/>rant and cant—the hack conventionality of the stage. If she
<lb/>does not suffer herself to be badgered out of this good path
<lb/>it will lead her inevitably to the highest distinction—a very
<lb/>proud triumph will assuredly be hers.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Crisp makes a respectable Melnotte, but little more.
<lb/>His action and general manner in this part, are not we think,
<lb/>sufficiently calm. Claude is not so much impetuous and im-
<lb break="no"/>pulsive, as the man of profound passions and deliberate pur-
<lb break="no"/>poses. Where he takes the character of the Prince Mr.
<lb/>Crisp very improperly makes him assume the coxcombical
<lb/>airs of the Count in “ Fashion.” He should be made to
<lb/>sneer—but no more. His true dignity should never be left
<lb/>out of sight. In light comedy Mr. Crisp is, indeed, a very
<lb/>admirable actor.</p><p>At the Park, the French troupe have been very successful,
and have unquestionably deserved success.

An Apology for Church Music and Musical Festivals, by
Edward Hodges, Mus. Doct. of Sidney Sussex College.
Cambridge.
</p><p>The subject of the remarks which we propose to present
<lb/>to our readers, is one of paramount importance to the profess-
<lb break="no"/>ors, and to the cause of music. There is ever a host of ene-
<lb break="no"/>mies ready to fall open-mouthed upon music and upon all re-
<lb break="no"/>lating to it, and more particularly is church music open to
<lb/>bitter and bigoted persecution, from men of all sects, more
<lb/>especially among the clergymen. Some of them probably
<lb/>are wroth at being compelled to shorten their sermons, in
<lb/>consequence of music lengthening the service; others, per-
<lb break="no"/>fectly conscious of the eloquence and beauty of their dis-
<lb break="no"/>courses, feel afraid that the music should draw off some of
<lb/>the admiration due to them. There are also, doubtless, some
<lb/>who conscientiously believe music an ungodly science, be-
<lb break="no"/>cause sinners and other profane people sing and play, and
<lb/>others who think that the money paid to singers and organ-
<lb break="no"/>ists could be used to much better advantage if placed at their,
<lb/>disposal. But we will leave to Dr. Hodges the defence of;
<lb/>church Music, being perfectly satisfied that there is no other
<lb/>man in this country so fully capable of handling the subject.</p><p></p><p>The remarks, of which we give a portion this week, were
<lb/>furnished us by the kindness of the author, and were written
<lb/>by him some years since, in answer to certain papers in
<lb/>which the propriety of refusing to allow the performance of
<lb/>the London Grand Musical Festival, to take place in West-
<lb break="no"/>minster Abbey, was powerfully argued.</p><p>How ably and triumphantly Dr. Hodges advocated the
cause of church music will be seen in our future numbers.
</p><p>We shall give the remarks nearly entire, for we are sure
<lb/>that the elegance and force of the writer's style, the unan-
<lb break="no"/>swerable truth of the arguments he advances, and the great
<lb/>authorities he quotes in his support, will prove all sufficient,</p><p>to recommend the papers to the earnest attention of cur rea-
ders.
</p><p> There is no science, human or divine, of such universal acepta-
<lb break="no"/>tion among mankind, as that no man can be found to impugn its
<lb/> pretensions. In this age of subversion, therefore, wherein all relig-
<lb break="no"/>ion is denounced as priestcraft, and civil government as tyranny, we
<lb/> are not to wonder that music also should have its adversaries. And
<lb/> yet, if in the whole range of human contemplation, there be any
<lb/> one thing which would seem less likely than all others to stir up
<lb/>strife and contention, that subject is the science of sweet sounds.
<lb/>Man, in all ages, from the infancy of the world to the present day,
<lb/>has recognized its power, and bowed to its influence. In every
<lb/>clime from the frigid regions about the poles, to the burning plains
<lb/>of the torrid zone, music has been appealed to as the laborum dulce
<lb/>lenimen, the joy of buoyant youth, the solace of declining age.
<lb/> Practised by saints and angels, lauded by sage philosophers, encour-
<lb break="no"/> aged by grave legislators, and sanctioned not only by the usage of
<lb/>time but by almost an identification with the most solemn offices
<lb/> of our most holy religien, it has come down to us to be aspersed and
<lb/> vilified in this our day as a pursuit utterly unworthy of an intellec-
<lb break="no"/>tual being, and in its noblest exhibitions to be stigmatized as a pro-
<lb break="no"/>fanation of our ecclesiastical edifices.</p><p></p><p>Now although nothing has been recently alleged against church
<lb/>music, which has not been adduced and triumphantly refuted, again
<lb/>and again, in past times ; yet forasmuch as it is possible that some
<lb/> persons may be carried away by the specious plausibility with
<lb/>which old sophistries have been tricked out, I have thought it not
<lb/>amiss, in the absence of a better champion, to attempt a brief reply
<lb/> to what modern gainsayers continue so pertinaciously to advance.
<lb/>This is the more necessary inasmuch as the opposition at present is
<lb/>principally conducted by two most respectable public prints, viz.
<lb/>the Standard, which may be considered as the organ of the high-
<lb break="no"/>church section of Toryism, and the Record, which may with equal
<lb/>truth be deemed the representative of the opinions of the so-called
<lb/>Evangelical party in the establishment. Had the “ railing accusa-
<lb break="no"/>tion’’ been confined to that portion of the public press which trades
<lb/>in sedition and revels in the imaginary perspective of the progres-
<lb break="no"/>sive destruction of all our venerable institutions, civil as well as sa-
<lb break="no"/>cred, the reproach might have been borne with honor, and suffered
<lb/>to pass unheeded as the idle snail which leaves its slimy track upon
<lb/>the village steeple. Every Christian musician [and I trust there
<lb/>are many such] feels on the occasion with David, the man after
<lb/> God’s own heart, and yet the most musical king the world ever
<lb/>saw, when he bemoans himself in Psalm LV., “ For it was not an
<lb/>enemy that reproached me, then I could have borne it; neither
<lb/> was it he that hated me, that did magnify himself against me, then
<lb/>I would have hid myself from him:" a psalm appropriately address-
<lb break="no"/> ed “ To the chief musician on Neginoth.” Still I should not have
<lb/> had recourse to this method of defending the science which I have
<lb/> the honor to profess, had not the editor of the Standard refused to
<lb/> insert a short communication which I addressed him in reply to some
<lb/>of his animadversions; contenting himself in his notice to corres-
<lb break="no"/>pondents with calling me “an enthusiast,” and informing the pub-
<lb break="no"/>lic that “ he could not accommodate his conscience to he the means
<lb/>of disseminating opinions which he believed to be erroneous,”
<lb/>although the latter referred to consisted principally of a statement
<lb/>of facts. Although this conduct of the editor would seem to be a
<lb/>departure from that straightforward rule of rectitude which I would
<lb/>fain believe has been and is generally his actuating principle, I can
<lb/>not be very angry with him on the occasion, as it has afforded me
<lb/>an opportunity of throwing into a more permanent shape the few
<lb/>arguments which I hope shortly to bring forward.</p><p></p><p>The Standard from time to time, for many months last past, has
<lb/>dropped hints of its antipathy to music. At length it began to speak
<lb/>more distinctly, and under date of the 26th March has a passage of
<lb/>this sort:</p><p></p><p>“ Sensuality of every kind, feasts and festivals, whether culinary or musi-
<lb break="no"/>cal, for both are alike sensual, ought to be forever excluded from the seats of
<lb/>learning and religion.”</p><p></p><p>"If the Bishop thinks with us, that the propriety of employing a Church
<lb/>as a place of sensual recreation, or as a place lor the collection of money, re-
<lb break="no"/>ceived in consideration of enjoyment of any kind ; if the Bishop thinks with
<lb/>us that the propriety of such an employment of a Church is at best doubtful,
<lb/>it is surely not merely his right, but his duty to avoid taking part in the ap-
<lb break="no"/>proaching festival.”</p><p></p><p>“ Our views are altogether practical. Leaving out of view, for the present,
<lb/>the higher question, whether the application to seculur uses of things usually
<lb/>devoted to the uses of religion be directly sinful or otherwise, we are quite
<lb/>sure that it is, consequentially, injurious to the interests of the Church that
<lb/>permits it.”</p><p></p><p>“ It is almost an instinct, or if it he not an instinct, it must be amongst the
<lb/>earliest truths that open to the mind, which teaches that the things of this
<lb/>world cannot he permitted to intrude upon the considerations of the next, and
<lb/>the services which these last enjoin, without detriment to the purity of relig-
<lb break="no"/>ious feeling. Nor must we lose sight of the fact, that at the present the
<lb/>Church of England is, in the strictest sense of the word a Church militant;
<lb/>that she is beset with enemies, by no means scrupulous in their warfure—with
<lb/>enemies who could easily enough convert a muster of singers and fiddlers in
<lb/>one of her principal temples, with an apparatus of check-takers and door-
<lb break="no"/>keepers to collect money for hearing these singers and fiddlers, into a very op-
<lb break="no"/>probitious similitude of a theatrical representation; and, unquestionably, they
<lb/>who would so represent a musical festival in a cathedral, would find ready
<lb/>hearers amongst the nonmusical part of the world, that is, among nineteen-
<lb break="no"/>twentieths of the populalion, including ourselves in the unhappy majority.</p><p><pb n="31"/>
</p><p>It is very true, there are those who think that music may be made subservient
<lb/>to the cultivation of religion; but it is a doleful truth that there are also
<lb/>those, we are persuaded the great majority, if they dare confess it, who feel
<lb/>eaen the very small infusion of music usually permitted in our liturgical service,
<lb/>an obstruction, rather than an aid to their religious contemplations.	The truth</p><p></p><p>of the matter is, the musical faculty not indigenous to our soil. We must
<lb/>not fall into the common mistake, that a love of songs is a taste for music,
<lb/>even were we a singing people, which we are not. It is merely the gratifica-
<lb break="no"/>tion which arises from the combination of variety with regularity, as express-
<lb break="no"/>ed in sounds, the same which we see exhibited in dancing, which adds to
<lb/>whatever pleasure is afforded by the words of a song,—but we must not get
<lb/>into a metaphysical treatise. Suffice it to say, that as the uninitiated in mu-
<lb break="no"/>sic do not go to musical festivals for the sake of devotion, so it may reason-
<lb break="no"/>ably be doubted. that many who do go to such festivals may be classed with
<lb/>those who go to church</p><p>‘ To hear the music there ;'
and that many more deceive themselves into the notion that their feelings
are religious, when they are little better than animal sensuality.

BERTINI’S METHOD FOR THE PIANO.
</p><p>THIS is the only thorough, complete and progressive work
<lb/>yet published in this country. Where pupils have used this me-
<lb break="no"/>thod, the most rapid advancement has been observed in all cases.
<lb/>The most prominent feature of this work is that the lessons, exerci-
<lb break="no"/>ses, scales and studies are given in such progressive order, that they
<lb/>enlist the interest of pupils, and carry them almost imperceptibly
<lb/>through those mechanical difficulties which, otherwise, arc too often
<lb/>made irksome in other instruction books. The time has arrived when
<lb/>a superficial knowledge of the Piano is of but little account, and it is
<lb/>only by the study of such methods as Bertini’s that pupils will be ena-
<lb break="no"/>bled to read music with facility, and at the same time become good
<lb/>musicians.</p><p></p><p>This method commences in the most plain and simple manner ; the
<lb/>rudiments of music being given and illustrated at the same time, and
<lb/>each lesson is fully explained by marginal notes on the same page.</p><p></p><p>The publishers are in possession of the highest recommendations
<lb/>from professional gentlemen, who speak of the superior merits of
<lb/>Bertini’s Method over all others yet published in this country, most
<lb/>of them having used the foreign copies previously. It will only be
<lb/>necessary to give a lew of the names in the principal cities.</p><p>Boston.	New-York.
