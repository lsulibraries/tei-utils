Echo-Song.
I know a noble heart that beats
For one it loves how “ wildly well!”
I only know for whom it beats ;
But I must never tell!
Never tell!
Hush! hark ! how Echo soft repeats,—
Ah! never tell!
I know a voice that falters low,
Whene’er one little name ’t would say ;
Full well that little name I know,
But that I’ll ne’er betray!
Ne’er betray!
Hush! hark! how Echo murmurs low,—
Ah! ne’er betray!
I know a smile that beaming flies
From soul to lip, with rapturous glow,
And I can guess who bids it rise;
But none—but none shall know!
None shall know!
Hush! hark! how Echo faintly sighs—
But none shall know !
FRANCES S. OSGOOD.
Why The Little Frenchman
WEARS HIS HAND IN A SLING.
</p><p>It’s on my wisiting cards sure enough (and it’s them that’s
<lb/>all o’ pink satin paper) that inny gintleman that plases may
<lb/>behould the intheristhin words, “ Sir Pathrick O’Grandison,
<lb/>Barronitt, 39 Southampton Row, Russell Square, Parrish o’
<lb/>Bloomsbury.” And shud ye be wantin to diskiver who is
<lb/>the pink of purliteness quite, and the laider of the hot tun
<lb/>in the houl city o' Lonon—why it’s jist mesilf. And fait that
<lb/>same is no wonder at all at all, (so be plased to stop curlin
<lb/>your nose,) for every inch o’ the six wakes that I’ve been a
<lb/>gintleman, and left aff wid the bog-throthing to take up wid
<lb/>the Barronissy, i’ts Pathrick that’s been living like a houly
<lb/>imperor, and gifting the iddication and the graces. Och !
<lb/>and would'nt it be a blessed thing for your sperrits if ye cud
<lb/>lay your two peepers jist, upon Sir Pathrick O’Grandison,
<lb/>Barronitt, when he is all riddy drissed for the hopperer, or
<lb/>“Upping into the Brisky for the drive into the Hyde Park.—
<lb/>But it's the iligant big figgur that I ave, for the rason o’
<lb/>which all the ladies fall in love wid me. Isn’t it my own
<lb/>swate silf now that’ll missure the six fut, and the three inch-
<lb break="no"/>es more nor that, in me stockings, and that am excadingly
<lb/>will proportioned all over to match ? And is it ralelly more
<lb/>than the three fut and a bit that there is, inny how, of the
<lb/>little ould furrener Frinchman that lives jist over the way,
<lb/>and that’s a oggling and a goggling the houl day, (and bad
<lb/>luck to him,) at the purty widdy Misthress Trade that’s my
<lb/>own nixt door neighbor, (God bliss her) and a most parlicul-</p><p>ler frind and acquintance? You percave the little spal-
</p><p>peen is summat down in the mouth, and wears his lift hand
<lb/>in a sling; and it’s for that same thing, by yur lave, that I’m
<lb/>going to give you the good rason.</p><p></p><p>The truth of the houl matter is jist simple enough ; for
<lb/>the very first day that I com’d from Connaught, and showd
<lb/>my swate little silf in the strait to the widdy, who was look-
<lb break="no"/>ing through the windy, it was a gone case althegither wid
<lb/>the heart o’ the purty Misthress Tracle. I percaved it, ye
<lb/>see, all at once, and no mistake, and that’s God’s thruth.
<lb/>First of all it was up wid the windy in a jiffy, and thin she
<lb/>threw open her two peepers to the itmost, and thin it was a
<lb/>little gould spy-glass that she dapped tight to one o’ them,
<lb/>and divil may burn me if it did’nt spake to me as plain as
<lb/>a peeper cud spake, and says it, through the spy-glass,
<lb/>“ Och ! the tip o’ the mornin to ye, Sir Pathrick O’Grandi-
<lb break="no"/>son, Barronitt, mavourneen; aud it’s a nate gintleman that
<lb/>ye are, sure enough, and it’s mesilf and me fortin jist that’ll
<lb/>be at yur sarvice, dear, inny time o’ day at all at all for the
<lb/>asking.” And it’s not mesilf ye wud have to be bate in the
<lb/>purliteness; so I made her a bow that wud ha broken yur
<lb/>heart althegither to behould, and thin I pulled aff me hat
<lb/>with a flourish, and thin I winked at her hard wid both eyes,
<lb/>as much as to say, “ Thrue for you, yer a swate little cra-
<lb break="no"/>ture, Mrs. Tracle, me darlint, and I wish I may be
<lb/>drownthed dead in a bog, if its not mesilf, Sir Pathrick
<lb/>O’Grandison, Barronitt, that’ll make a houl bushel o’ love to
<lb/>yur leddy-ship, in the twinkling o’ the eye of a Londonderry
<lb/>purraty.”</p><p></p><p>And it was the nixt mornin, sure, jist as I was making
<lb/>up me mind whither it wouldn’t be the purlite thing to
<lb/>sind a bit o’ writin to the widdy by way of a love-litter,
<lb/>when up cum’d the delivery sarvant wid an illigant card,
<lb/>and he tould me that the name on it (for I niver cud rade
<lb/>the copper-plate printin on account of being lift handed) was
<lb/>all about Mounseer, the Count, A Goose, Look-aisy, Mai-
<lb break="no"/>ter-di-dauns, and that the houl of the divilish lingo was the
<lb/>spalpeeny long name of the little ould furrener Frinchman
<lb/>as lived over the way.</p><p></p><p>And jist wid that in cum’d the little willian himsilf, and
<lb/>thin he made me a broth of a bow, and thin he said he had
<lb/>ounly taken the liberty of doing me the honor of the giving
<lb/>me a call, and thin he went on to palaver at a great rate, and
<lb/>divil the bit did I comprehind what he wud be afther the
<lb/>tilling me at all at all, excipting and saving that he said
<lb/>“ pully wou, woolly wou,” and tould me, among a bushel o’
<lb/>lies, bad luck to him, that he was mad for the love o’ my
<lb/>widdy Misthress Tracle, and that my widdy Mrs. Tracle had
<lb/>a puncheon for him.</p><p></p><p>At the hearin of this, ye may swear, though, I was as mad
<lb/>as a grasshopper, but I remimbered that I was Sir Pathrick
<lb/>O’Grandison, Barronitt, and that it wasn’t althegither gentaal
<lb/>to lit the anger git the upper hand o’ the purliteness, so I
<lb/>made light o’ the matter and kipt dark, and got quite socia-
<lb break="no"/>ble wid the little chap, and afther a while what did he do</p><p><pb n="130"/>
but ask me to go wid him to the widdy’s, saying he wud
give me the feshionable inthroduction to her leddyship.
</p><p>“ Is it there ye are ?” said I thin to mesilf, “ and its thrue
<lb/>for you. Pathrick, that ye’re the fortunnittest mortal in life.
<lb/>We’ll soon see now whither its your swate silf, or whither
<lb/>its little Mounseer Maiter-di-dauns, that Misthress Tracle is
<lb/>head and ears in the love wid.’’</p><p></p><p>Wid that we wint aff to the widdy’s, next door, and ye
<lb/>may well say it was an illigant place; so it was. There
<lb/>was a carpet all over the floor, and in one corner there was
<lb/>a forty-pinny and a jews-harp and the divil knows whatilse,
<lb/>and in another corner was a sofy, the beautifullest thing in
<lb/>all natur, aud sitting on the sofy, sure enough, there was the
<lb/>swate little angel, Misthress Tracle.</p><p></p><p>“ The tip o’ the morning to ye,” says I, “Mrs. Trade,”
<lb/>and thin I made sich an iligant obaysance that it wud ha
<lb/>quite althegither bewildered the brain o’ ye.</p><p></p><p>“ Wully woo, pully woo, plump in the mud,” says the
<lb/>little furrenner Frinchman, “and sure Mrs. Tracle,” says
<lb/>he, that he did, “isn’t this gintleman here jist his riverence
<lb/>Sir Pathrick O’Grandison, Barronitt, and isn’t he althegither
<lb/>and entirely the most purticular frind and acquintance that
<lb/>I have in the houl world ?”</p><p></p><p>And wid that the widdy, she gits up from the sofy, and
<lb/>makes the swatest curtchy nor iver was seen ; and thin down
<lb/>she sits like an angel; and thin, by the powers, it was that
<lb/>little spalpeen Mounseer Maiter-di-dauns that plumped
<lb/>his silf right down by the right side of her. Och hon ! I
<lb/>ixpicted the two eyes o’ me wud ha cum’d out of my head
<lb/>on the spot, I was so dispirate mad ! Howiver, “ Bait
<lb/>who!” says I, after a while. “ Is it there ye are, Mounseer
<lb/>Maiter-di-dauns ?” and so down I plumped on the lift side
<lb/>of her leddyship, to be aven wid the willain. Botheration!
<lb/>it wud ha done your heart good to percave the illigant double
<lb/>wink that I gived her jist thin right in the face wid both
<lb/>eyes.</p><p></p><p>But the little ould Frinchman he niver beginned to suspict
<lb/>me at all at all, and disperate hard it was he made the love
<lb/>to her leddyship. “Woully wou” says he, “Pully wou”
<lb/>says he, “ Plump in the mud" says he.</p><p></p><p>“ That’s all to no use, Mounseer Frog, mavourneen,”
<lb/>thinks I; and I talked as hard and as fast as I could all the
<lb/>while, and throth it was mesilf jist that divarted her leddy-
<lb break="no"/>ship complately and intirely, by rason of the illigant con-
<lb break="no"/>versation that I kipt up wid her all about the dear bogs of
<lb/>Connaught. And by and by she gived me such a swate
<lb/>smile, from one ind of her mouth to the ither, that it made
<lb/>me as bould as a pig, and I jist took hould of the ind of her
<lb/>little finger in the most dillikittest manner in natur, look-
<lb break="no"/>ing at her all the while out o’ the whites of my eyes.</p><p></p><p>And then ounly to percave the cuteness of the swate an-
<lb break="no"/>gel, for no sooner did she obsarve that I was afther the
<lb/>squazing of her flipper, than she up wid it in a jitfy, and put
<lb/>it away behind her back, jist as much as to say, “ Now thin,
<lb/>Sir Pathrick O’Grandison, there’s a bitther chance for ye,
<lb/>mavourneen, for its not altogether the gentaal thing to be
<lb/>afther the squazing of my flipper right full in the sight of
<lb/>that little furrenner Frinchman, Mounseer Maiter-di-dauns.”</p><p></p><p>Wid that I giv’d her a big wink jist to say, “ lit Sir Path-
<lb break="no"/>rick alone for the likes o’ them thricks,” and thin I wint
<lb/>aisy to work, and you'd have died wid the divarsion to be-
<lb break="no"/>hould how oliverly I slipped my right arm betwane the back
<lb/>o’ the sofy, and the back of her leddyship, and there, sure
<lb/>enough, I found a swate little flipper all a waiting to say,</p><p>“ the tip o’ the mornin to ye, Sir Pathrick O’Grandison, Bar-
</p><p>ronitt.” And wasn’t it mesilf, sure, that jist giv’d it the laste
<lb/>little bit of a squaze in the world, all in the way of a com-
<lb break="no"/>mincement, and not to be too rough wid her leddyship? and
<lb/>och, botheration, wasn’t it the gentaalest and dilikittest of all
<lb/>the little squazes that I got in return? “Blood and thun-
<lb break="no"/>der, Sir Pathrick, mavourneen” thinks I to mesilf, “ fait it’s
<lb/>jist the mother’s son of you, and nobody else at all at all,
<lb/>that’s the handsomest and the fortunittest young bogthrotter
<lb/>that ever cum’d out of Connaught!” And wid that I giv’d
<lb/>the flipper a big squaze, and a big squaze it was, by the
<lb/>powers, that her leddyship giv’d to me back. But it would
<lb/>ha split the seven sides of you wid the laffin to behould,
<lb/>jist thin all at once, the concated behaviour of Mounseer
<lb/>Maiter-di-dauns. The likes o’ sich a jabbering, and a smirk-
<lb break="no"/>ing, and a parly-wouing as he begin’d wid her leddyship,
<lb/>niver was known before upon arth; and divil may burn me
<lb/>if it wasn’t me own very two peepers that cotch’d him tip-
<lb break="no"/>ping her the wink out of one eye. Och hon ! if it wasn’t
<lb/>mesilf thin that was mad as a Kilkenny cat I shud like to be
<lb/>tould who it was!</p><p></p><p>“ Let me infarm you, Mounseer Maiter-di-dauns,” said I,
<lb/>as purlite as iver ye seed, “ that it’s not the gintaal thing at
<lb/>ail at all, and not for the likes o’ you inny how, to be afther
<lb/>the oggling and a goggling at her leddyship in that fashion,”
<lb/>and jist wid that such another squaze as it was I giv’d her
<lb/>flipper, all as much as to say, “ isn’t it Sir Pathrick now,
<lb/>my jewel, that’ll he able to the proticting o’ you, my dar-
<lb break="no"/>lint ?” and then there cum’d another squaze back, all by way
<lb/>of the answer. “ Thrue for you, Sir Pathrick,” it said as
<lb/>plain as iver a squaze said in the world, “ Thrue for you,
<lb/>Sir Pathrick, mavourneen, and it’s a proper nate gintleman
<lb/>ye are—that God’s truth,” and wid that she opened her two
<lb/>beautiful peepers till I belaved they wud ha com d out of her
<lb/>hid althegither and intirely, and she looked first as mad as a
<lb/>cat at Mounseer Frog, and thin as smiling as all out o’ doors
<lb/>at mesilf.</p><p></p><p>“ Thin," says he, the willian, “ Och hon ! and a woolly-
<lb break="no"/>wou, pully-wou,” and thin wid that he shoved up his two
<lb/>shoulders till the divil the bit of his hid was to be diskiver-
<lb break="no"/>ed, and thin he let down the two corners of his purraty-trap,
<lb/>and thin not a haporth more of the satisfaction could I git
<lb/>out o’ the spalpeen.</p><p></p><p>Belave me, my jewel, it was Sir Pathrick that was unra-
<lb break="no"/>sonable mad thin, and the more by token that the Finchman
<lb/>kipt an wid his winking at the widdy; and the widdy
<lb/>she kip tan wid the squazing of my flipper, as much as to say,
<lb/>“ At him again Sir Pathrick O’Grandison, mavourneen;” so
<lb/>I jist ripped out wid a big oath, and says I,</p><p></p><p>“ Ye little spalpeer.y frog of a bog-throtting son of a bloody-
<lb break="no"/>noun !”—and jist thin what d’ye think it was that her leddy-
<lb break="no"/>ship did ? Troth she jumped up from the sofy as if she was
<lb/>bit, and made all through the door, while I turned my head
<lb/>round afther her, in a complate bewilderment and bothera-
<lb break="no"/>tion, and followed her wid me two peepers. You percave I
<lb/>had a rason of my own for the knowing that she could’nt git
<lb/>down the stairs althegither and entirely; for I knew very
<lb/>well that I had hould of her hand, for divil the bit had I
<lb/>iver lit it go. And says I,</p><p></p><p>“Isn’t it the laste little bit of a mistake in the world that
<lb/>ye’ve been afther the making, yer leddyship ? Come back
<lb/>now, that’s a darlint, and I’ll give ye yur flipper." But afl
<lb/>she wint down the stairs like a shot, and then I turned round
<lb/>to the little Frinch furrenner. Och hon! if it wasn't his
<lb/>spalpeeny little paw that I had hould of in my own—why
<lb/>thin—thin it was'nt—that’s all.</p><p><pb n="131"/>
</p><p>And maybe it wasn’t mesilf that jist died then outright
<lb/>wid the laffin, to behould the little chap when he found out
<lb/>that it wasn’t the widdy at all at all that he had had hould
<lb/>of all the time, but only Sir Pathrick O’Grandison. The ould
<lb/>divil himsilf niver behild sich a long face as he pet an! As
<lb/>for Sir Pathrick O’Grandison, Barronitt, it wasn’t for the
<lb/>likes of his riverence to be afther the minding a thrifle of a
<lb/>mistake. Ye may jist say, though (for it’s God’s thruth) that
<lb/>afore I lift hould of the flipper of the spalpeen, (which was
<lb/>not till afther her leddyship’s futmen had kicked us both
<lb/>down the stairs,) I gived it such a nate little broth of a
<lb/>squaze, as made it all up into raspberry jam.</p><p>“Wouly-wou,” says he, “pully-wou,” says he—“Cot
tam !”
And that’s jist the thruth of the rason why he wears his
lift hand in a sling.	LITTLETON BARRY.
To the River -------------
Fair river! in thy bright, clear flow
Of chrystal, wandering water,
Thou art an emblem of the glow
Of beauty—the unhidden heart—
The playful maziness of art
In old Alberto’s daughter;
But when within thy wave she looks—
Which glistens then, and trembles—
Why, then, the prettiest of brooks
Her worshipper resembles;
For in my heart, as in thy stream,
Her image deeply lies—
The heart which trembles at the beam
Of her soul-searching eyes.	P

ACT. I.
</p><p>Scene I.—In Clairvoir’s house.—A drawingroom, with three win-
<lb break="no"/>dows, having Venetian blinds on the outside. The sashes of the
<lb/>windows are raised, and the blinds of one of them bowed, with the
<lb/>laths inclining downwards. At this latter window, Mary Mild-
<lb break="no"/>may is seen sitting, in a listless attitude, as though she were
<lb/>looking idly into the street; her cheek rests upon one hand,
<lb/>while the other holds some needlework negligently upon her lap.</p><p>Enter Catharine, gaily. She runs up to Mary, clapping her
hands together
Cath. They're at it! they’re at it! Coz ! cousin Mary ! Why,
what the deuce is in the girl ? [ Shaking her.] Here is the greatest
</p><p>sport in the world going on, and all within doors; yet you sit there
<lb/>moping, gazing through the blinds at dirt-carts and omnibuses, as
<lb/>if there were poetry in dust and music in wagon wheels ! Have
<lb/>you no respect for science ? no regard for the exaltation of human
<lb/>nature ? Ha, ha, ha!</p><p>Mary. I am not in spirits, Kate.
</p><p>Cath. [Mimicking.] Not in spirits, Kate ! Not in liquor, I
<lb/>suppose. Now, if you were a man, I should verily believe you
<lb/>were. But I’ll tell you what you are in, Mary : you are in love;
<lb/>and that’s the most spiritless thing in the world, I’m sure.</p><p>Mary. [Rising.] I should hope not, cousin; for then, poor
Mr. Walton!
</p><p>Cath. Well, that sounds somewhat like life. And now, since
<lb/>you are fairly roused, let us off to the library. [Brings her for-
<lb break="no"/>ward.] Come, instead of watching for Mr. Arnold Dulruse, let us
<lb/>see what Mr. Arnold’s mother is doing to my papa and your
<lb/>uncle.</p><p>Mary. But, Kate dear, how can you tease one so ? You know
I never—that is—I mean—I never now like to talk of Arnold.
</p><p>Cath. No, but—that is—I mean—you love to think on him.
<lb/>Ha, ha! my gentle, and most constant, and grave, and pensive
<lb/>Mary, how you blush!</p><p>Mary. You have bad eyes, cousin.
</p><p>Cath. Then Schuyler tells me very great fibs. The dear, good-
<lb break="no"/>for-nothing, rhyming!—Did’nt he say that—let me see, what was
<lb/>it? O! [Declaiming.] “ Oh, by those eyes, whose rays are like
<lb/>—are like—O! are like the stars, that through the blue of hea-
<lb break="no"/>ven their”—and so on. There, you malicious little devil, you see
<lb/>that I am greater than Atlas. I bear a firmament between my
<lb/>eyelids, and am a sort of peripatetic animated universe, or at least,
<lb/>a circumambulatory supercelestial! Bad eyes, you envious crea-
<lb break="no"/>ture ! Stars! stars ! and of the first magnitude. When did your
<lb/>dull, prosaical lover, ever say anything half so fine to you ?</p><p></p><p>Mary. Why, in truth, never. And I am much obliged to him;
<lb/>for, had he likened my eyes to stars, I should have thought that he
<lb/>felt himself in the dark when under their beams, and that a release
<lb/>to the streets was a welcome escape into daylight, or a waking
<lb/>from the night into morning. Of trite similes, the sun is rather
<lb/>more cheerful and vivifying, if one must have such celestial non-
<lb break="no"/>sense.</p><p>Cath. I vow, I’ll pinch you to death. But come, coz.
Mary. Where ?
</p><p>Cath. To see Papa play Mr. Peale to Mrs. Dulrusers Blind
<lb/>Lady : the museum, our little library. Letty saw them go there a
<lb/>minute ago. By this time, the curtain must be up, and the farce
<lb/>will want spectators. Come, Mary darling, I would’nt miss the
<lb/>scene for worlds.</p><p>Mary. But cannot you go alone, Kate ? I—I would rather—I
would rather not go, cousin ; because—because—
</p><p>Cath. Because you had rather stay here, to look from the win-
<lb break="no"/>dow, and fancy every orangeman you see is about to be metamor-
<lb break="no"/>phosed into sober Mr. Dulruse, with his arm full of golden compli-
<lb break="no"/>ments and fragrant suavities, just imported from Cyprus, and to
<lb/>wish that the next image-vender were your solemn beau, with all
<lb/>his little plaster Cupids turned into spiritual, ardent, real Loves, and
<lb/>nestling in his head, instead of spreading their squab wings on the
<lb/>boarded top of it.</p><p>Mary. Indeed, indeed, Catharine, you mistake me ; I was not
—not looking for Arnold. [Bursts into tears.]
</p><p>Cath. [Rising and embracing her affectionately.] And sup-
<lb break="no"/>pose that you were, dear, good Mary ! Now, do forgive me : in-
<lb break="no"/>deed I did not mean to vex you; and I cannot see any harm in
<lb/>one's wishing for one’s sweetheart.</p><p></p><p>Mary. But I assure you, Catharine, I had no such idea. I
<lb/>should—I confess—be glad to see Arnold—though, perhaps, after
<lb/>his—his late—neglect, I ought not; but that, really, was not my
<lb/>motive.</p><p></p><p>Cath. Well, I wont ask you. We will let Papa amuse him-
<lb break="no"/>self without us. There ! kiss me once more, to show that you for-
<lb break="no"/>give me : you know I am such a rattle; I am always saying things
<lb/>I ought not.</p><p><pb n="132"/>
</p><p>Mary. But there is no harm done, Kate; and I am not angry.
<lb/>Cath. No, you dear soul, you are too sweet-tempered ever to be
<lb/>angry. [Kissing her again and embracing.]</p><p>Mary. Come, cousin ; don’t mistake me for yourself, and your-
self for Mr. Walton.
Cath. Not quite, or you would not have had that kiss.
Mary. Hum!
</p><p>Cath. Now, I will pinch you. You’re a naughty, malicious—
<lb/>Mary. Oh yes ! an old receipt to hide confusion. Whose turn
<lb/>is it now, Kate ?	[A loud ringing heard, as of a door-bell.]</p><p>Cath. Why, yours again; and to lose color, too. I told you,
you expected—
Mary. No. Kate, upon my word! Indeed ! I am sure it is not
he. [Sighing.] That is Mr. Walton.
</p><p>Cath. A dozen pair of gloves, it is not! Run to the window;
<lb/>you can’t be seen. Pshaw! you're a snail! Let me. [Looks
<lb/>through the blinds for a second, and comes back blushing and con-
<lb break="no"/>fused.]</p><p>Mary. You’ve lost. I knew it—[Sighing]—and you never lost
a wager more willingly.
Cath. Not since it gives you pain, believe me, dear Mary.
But where is the girl going ? Mr. Walton wont eat you up.
</p><p>Mary. No, but he would be cross enough to snap at me, if I
<lb/>staid. There’s the door shut. Three spoils company. [Going.]
<lb/>Cath. And one should do as one should be done by, ah, coz.'
<lb/>[Running after and hugging her. Exit Mary.] The dear,
<lb/>sweet girl! What a pity she should have such a lover!</p><p>Enter Walton.
Walt. What lover is that, Catharine, that is so happy as to be
the object of your pity ?
</p><p>Cath. Not you, Schuyler; or I should wish you far enough.
<lb/>Walt. Why, yes; for Pity, if akin to Love, is one of that sort
<lb/>of poor relations we are seldom proud to acknowledge.</p><p>Cath. True ; for nine times out of ten, Contempt is in the fam-
ily.
</p><p>Walt. And, the tenth time, she may be found to bo a twin-sis-
<lb break="no"/>ter. Happy fellow, if such be the lineage of the gentleman now in
<lb/>question.</p><p>Cath. Why, whom are you talking of now ?
Walt. The lover, surely, whom you named as I entered.
Cath. It would fit him well, in the case. But my pity was not
bestowed upon the lover, but the lady. Poor Mary !
Walt. Your cousin, Miss Mildmay ?
</p><p>Cath. Yes; and I wonder more and more, every day, what a
<lb/>girl of her good taste could have seen in that sour Mr. Dulruse to
<lb/>bewitch her; and, were it not for her evident uneasiness, I should
<lb/>really rejoice at his present indifference : he is quite unworthy of
<lb/>so good a girl, I am sure, and some other man might one day make
<lb/>her fur happier than her tender nature could ever hope to be with
<lb/>a person of his character.</p><p>Walt. Generous creature ! I do love you so, for that very love
you bear your orphan cousin.
Cath. What! more than for my eyes? the stars, you know.
Take care, Mr. Poet; I shall be jealous.
Walt. And you will have cause, Catharine, whenever your vir-
tues seem inferior to Miss Mildmay’s.
</p><p>Cath. And are my eyes then to count for nothing ? O sacrile-
<lb break="no"/>gious and rebellious wretch! I must have you to your rhymes
<lb/>again. When did I give you leave to forget my beauty in the cat-
<lb break="no"/>alogue of my numerous qualifications ?</p><p></p><p>Walt. When you taught me that your heart outshone it, and
<lb/>that your mind was its divinest essence. [Kissing her hand.]
<lb/>Cath. Well; pretty well, that: your disloyalty is atoned for.
<lb/>And now, let go my fingers, and I will tell you a secret. First,
<lb/>what do you think of Mrs. Dulruse ? Come, don't hesitate.</p><p>Walt. If my position will excuse my speaking so plainly. Yet,
I would rather not.
</p><p>Cath. Fie, Schuyler! what scrupulosity! Why, she is only
<lb/>our housekeeper—as yet, thank Heaven! and you know I do not
<lb/>like her.</p><p>Walt. Yet, she is a lady; at least she has been so accounted;
and, at all events, she is a woman.
</p><p>Cath. Well then, since you are so delicate, I will be your
<lb/>mouthpiece. I will speak for you; and you shall see how well I
<lb/>can read your thoughts.</p><p>Walt. Take care you don’t misspell.
</p><p>Cath. You shall ferule my hand, if I do. Nay, don’t take hold
<lb/>of it already ; I have not yet missed. You think her, Schuyler, an
<lb/>artful, heartless, and mercenary woman, whose will, were it but
<lb/>assisted by her intellect, would render her dangerous ; but her ig-
<lb break="no"/>norance makes her blunder, and her scheming degenerates, through
<lb/>her fatuity, into mere cunning.</p><p>Walt. Which is the intelligence of vulgar minds. You have
read me well. Now, what follows?
Cath. How would you like her for a mother-in-law ?
Walt. Like her ? But that is impossible!
Cath. What then if she become my mother?
Walt. Good God! your father—Mr. Clairvoir cannot be so
blind ?
Cath. Indeed, but he is: the deluded are always so. And they
are at this very moment about it.
Walt. Surely, it cannot be; there is some mistake; you are
not so unhappy. Gone to be married !
Cath. I did not say so. But they are going through with the
preliminaries; courtship and infatuation.
</p><p>Walt. I do not understand you. You talk, Catharine, of what
<lb/>should be a misery to you, and would be, did not our own marriage
<lb/>promise you a speedy release from it; yet there is a laughing hu-
<lb break="no"/>mor in those darling eyes, and a smile about those beautiful lips,
<lb/>that—</p><p></p><p>Cath. I had better tell you at once, I see; for you are lapsing
<lb/>into poetry and flattery. Did you ever hear of Animal Magnetism,
<lb/>or Mesmerism, or whatever other ism, except skepticism, you may
<lb/>choose to name it ?</p><p>Walt. Surely; who has not?
Cath. And do you believe in it ?
</p><p>Walt. Do I believe that I can see without eyes, hear without
<lb/>ears, smell without a nose, taste without a tongue, and feel without
<lb/>either feet or hands ?</p><p></p><p>Cath. Well, my father does; and some book that he has lately
<lb/>been reading, has carried his credulity to a pitch that is absolute
<lb/>fanaticism. Now, Mrs. Dulruse has for a long time been making
<lb/>love to him.</p><p>Walt. Nothing uncommon in the house-keeper of a wealthy
widower.
</p><p>Cath. So I suppose; but it is not the more agreeable for all
<lb/>that. Well, what does the cunning creature do, but gradually, af-
<lb break="no"/>ter a little well-managed resistance, become a convert to these fan-
<lb break="no"/>tastical doctrines. My father, of course, was vastly delighted, the
<lb/>more so that I had made free to ridicule their nonsense, and con-
<lb break="no"/>ceiving that there might be some undiscovered magnetic affinities
<lb/>between himself and the amiable Dulruse, he yesterday set him-
<lb break="no"/>self to explore the localities, doubtless with the full consent of the
<lb/>proprietress. My Letty, who is about the cleverest maid that
<lb/>ever lady was blest with, has, I have lately seen, much to my vex-
<lb break="no"/>ation, been slily amusing herself with the growing cordiality of my
<lb/>father and his housekeeper, and, shrewdly suspecting that the lat-
<lb break="no"/>ter, (whom she hates as cordially as her good nature will let her
<lb/>hate anything,) would make some rare use of the new experiments,
<lb/>she took the liberty of listening and peeping in the keyhole of the
<lb/>library, where they were performed. I have reprimanded her for
<lb/>this impropriety, and forbid her repeating it; but I could not pre-
<lb break="no"/>vent myself from hearing what she came in haste to tell me. You
<lb/>look grave, Schuyler: was I wrong ?</p><p>Walt. I think you were; you should have stopped her at once,
my dear girl.
</p><p>Cath. And I believe I should, had I had time to make the reso-
<lb break="no"/>lution; but Letty took me quite by surprise, and, before I knew
<lb/>what I was about she had emptied her entire budget for my bene
<lb/> fit. And what do you think it amounted to ?</p><p>Walt. I do not like to guess.
<pb n="133"/>
Cath. Why, that Mrs. Dulruse has an actual design to entrap
my father into a speedy, if not an immediate marriage.
Walt. But the girl may have deceived herself.
</p><p>Cath. No, no; she is the shrewdest of the shrewd. Besides,
<lb/>my dear Schuyler, I drew precisely the same conclusion from
<lb/>what she told me, as she herself had done. Now, have you a de-
<lb break="no"/>sire to observe this folly ?</p><p>Walt. How ?
</p><p>Cath. Simply, by being a spectator of it. Just before yon
<lb/>came in Papa led his inamorata to the library, Letty tells me ; and
<lb/>there is no doubt he is now manipulating on her wrinkled sinciput,
<lb/>and making, as he supposes (I should blush to say it of my father,
<lb/>to any body but you,) his spirit pass into hers over the very ethereal
<lb/>bridge of his thumbs. I wanted Mary to go in with me to see this
<lb/>demonstration of the separability of the soul; but she refused, poor
<lb/>thing, I suspect, because of late—from—from—for a certain reason
<lb/>which I cannot name to you now, Mrs. Dulruse has treated her
<lb/>with no little insolence, and she believes her (very rightly, if she
<lb/>knew all) to be the chief cause of her son’s estrangement.</p><p></p><p>Walt. But how will your father relish our intrusion ?
<lb/>Cath. Be delighted with it. He will glory in the demonstra-
<lb break="no"/>tion of his fancied science. Come. But first, we’ll endeavor to 
<lb/>persuade Mary to join us; I long to open the eyes of that innocent
<lb/>creature to the character of the Dulruses, mother and son: she
<lb/>should not marry that man.</p><p>Walt. You are very right: she were better dead. I will go
with you.
</p><p>Cath. Mary is in the next room. Before we go to the library, 
<lb/>I will ring for Letty, that she may repeat before you what she
<lb/>knows of this intrigue, as I fear it to be on one side; and you shall 
<lb/>draw your own conclusions. Do not fear; the girl is not an ordi-
<lb break="no"/>nary servant; she may safely be made a confidant. And besides,
<lb/>Schuyler, nothing, that is not dishonorable, should stand in our
<lb/>way, to prevent a consummation as melancholy almost for you as it
<lb/>would be for me.</p><p>Walt. Sensible girl. [Kissing her hand.]
Cath. Fie! you are as bad as my father. Does good sense lie
to the fingers ?
Walt. No, Kate, but a most delicate sensation does. [Exeunt,
at the tide.]
</p><p>Sceke II.—A room of smaller dimensions, surrounded with shelves of 
<lb/>books. Globes, maps, and the various other articles usual in a pri-
<lb break="no"/>vate library. Mrs. Dulruse is discovered seated in a Voltaire-chair,
<lb/>in the position and with the appearance proper to the magnetic slum-
<lb break="no"/>ber. Clairvoir, seated before her in another chair. Just as the
<lb/>scene opens, he throws himself back in his seat, and gazes with a show
<lb/>of admiration on his patient.</p><p></p><p>Clair. Wonderful, celestial science ! Where now are the prim-
<lb break="no"/>ordial bounds which would-be philosophers have pretended were
<lb/>set by Nature to human action and to human thought ? Man, no
<lb/>longer a creature of the elements, no more a slave to the narrow
<lb/>Powers excited by mere blood, and bones, and muscle.—man, the
<lb/>spirit, not the carcase, shall not now say unto the worm, " Thou
<lb/>art my mother and my sister,” but unto the angels, " Ye are my
<lb/>brethren” : for he is now, omnipotent, ubiquitous,—ah ! he may be
<lb/>omniscient. Then, seeing all, knowing all, penetrating into all
<lb/>space and at one time, he shall be greater than the angels. Glo-
<lb break="no"/>rious aspirations ! Nor let it be deemed profane: have not pious
<lb/>men proclaimed it lawful ? Has not Heaven given us these pow-</p><p></p><p>ers to be used ? Heaven laid the magnet where, in process of time,
<lb/>it was discovered; and, in a still longer process, man applied it to
<lb/>its destined purpose; and Heaven gave us these magnetic affinities,
<lb/>which, suspected long ago, but only discovered in their full extent
<lb/>within a brief period, set man at once above all former sublunary
<lb/>considerations. What now need he travel for, at the risk of life, to
<lb/>foreign countries ? Seated in his chair, he wills himself into the
<lb/>mind of another and congenial spirit, who, at his direction, travels
<lb/>in thought to all quarters of the world, without moving an inch—
<lb/>sees now the British massacre in China,—now counts the Arabs
<lb/>slaughtered in Algiers, and now prognosticates the sex of the forth-
<lb break="no"/>coming issue of Victoria ; and the tally conveyance, and uncertain </p><p></p><p>news, of mails and steam-packets, are entirely superseded. Disease
<lb/>itself has henceforth no secret. I will my amiable Dorothy to look
<lb/>into my bowels; she does so: she sees at a glance what is there
<lb/>disturbed, what needs repairing; and the doctor, no more working
<lb/>in the dark, prescribes with safety, and Death is bid defiance.
<lb/>Hail, mysterious source of— What am I doing ! I, who till now
<lb/>have ridiculed soliloquies upon the stage, in my rapture guilty of
<lb/>as great a folly! Yet no; I do not speak alone and to myself;
<lb/>there sits my coadjutor, my sympathetic Dolly ; and doubtless, at
<lb/>this moment, though locked, by the semi-gyration of my thumbs, in
<lb/>a slumber which, as has been properly said, “ a park of artillery
<lb/>would not disturb,” she hears all, and sees all, as though she were
<lb/>awake. Do you not, madam ?</p><p>Mrs. D. As clear as starch.
</p><p>Clair. I thought so! I thought so! Wonderful!—a few more
<lb/>experiments, and I will release you from this fatiguing, though ec-
<lb break="no"/>static trance. Let us mount into the moon : I want to know what
<lb/>the people there are doing. Here, give me your hands.</p><p>Mrs. D. But you must n’t let me fall.
Clair. Never fear, madam. Are you ready ? Let us fly then !
[He lifts her hands up and down, to imitate the motion of wings.]
Mrs. D. O, what a wondersome height. But I shall fall
Mercy on me ! my head goes round like a top.
Clair. Hold fast, then. And, faith, you do ! You squeeze like
the devil. Not quite so hard. There ; are you there ?
Mrs. D. Yes, I am in a wonderful place. It does n’t look like
green cheese : that must be a lie.
Clair. No doubt; no doubt. Do you see any mountains, mad-
am, and valleys ?
</p><p>Mrs. D. Yes, a great many of’em ; one ever so big; six times
<lb/>as high as the Catskills, and with trees growing on the top of it.
<lb/>Lor' ! it’s shaped like a man’s nose: it must be a part of the face
<lb/>we see in the full moon.</p><p>Clair. Very likely. But they must have a wonderful climate
there, for trees to grow at such a height.
Mrs. D. Yes; but then, there are none in the valleys.
Clair. Ah! I see! I see! That explains it. Everything is just
the reverse of what it is here on earth. Wonderful!
Mrs. D. Oh yes; there goes a man, walking as fast as ever ha
can, on his head. Good gracious!
Clair. Are you sure!
Mrs. D. Yes; for he meets a lady, and they touch heels go-
gether.
Clair. Toes, you mean.
Mrs. D. Yes, toes, to salute one another.
Clair How are they dressed ?
</p><p>Mrs. D. Spare my blushes. I do declare—I—don’t ask me ;
<lb/>but I don’t think they have anything on them; not a rag. The
<lb/>nasty beasts!</p><p></p><p>Clair. A state of innocence and unsophisticated nature. No
<lb/>stocks there fluctuate with the rise and fall of cotton; no quarrels
<lb/>threaten from an agitated tariff on silks. Do you see any water ?</p><p>Mrs. D. Oceans full; and, my stars! there is a man on the
shore milking a whale ! Did you ever!
Clair. The very thing Locke said! I never could have believed
it. Does he do it standing ?
Mrs. P. No; he's lying on his face, feet foremost.
Clair. And draws the udder with his toes ! A strange variety
of the genus Homo. Are you tired, my dear ? shall we descend ?
Mrs. D. If you please; it feels too cold here. [She shudders,
and her teeth chatters.] But don’t let me fall.
</p><p>Clair. Never fear. [She puts her arm about his neck.] That’s
<lb/>right. But, the deuse! don’t hug so hard; or you’ll strangle me.
<lb/>There; are you home I</p><p>Mrs. D. Yes. O me! I’m so tired !
Clair. And what do you see here ?
Mrs. D. Mr. Walton is in the drawing-room, courting Miss
Clairvoir.
Clair. Like enough ; the bell rung a little while ago. Well,
that is all right.
Mrs. P- Ah, I’m afeard not!
<pb n="134"/>
Clair. No ? Why not ?
Mrs. D. She never will marry him.
Clair. The deuse she won’t ! This is had news. Are you very
sure ?
</p><p>Mrs. D. Yes; another match is laid out for her, that will make
<lb/>her case so much happier. He will be the richest man in the city,
<lb/>—twice as rich as John Jacob Astor; and they will have lots of
<lb/>children.</p><p>Clair. But who is he ? who is he ?
Mrs. D. I blush to say. Do not ask me!
Clair. Nay, dear madam ; speak out: nobody hears you.
Mrs. D. But will you forgive me ?
Clair. Surely; I cannot help fate: you see but what will hap-
pen.
Mrs. D. And what ought to happen; for shockin’ things will
take place, if it don't, Mr. Clairvoir. It is---
Clair. Who ?
Mrs. D. His name begins with A, and ends with E.
Clair. A ? and ends with E ? Who can that be ? [to himself."]
</p><p>Mrs. D. Now I see him clearly: he kneels to ask my blessing,
<lb/>and his wife kneels to ask her father’s; what a lovely couple ! It
<lb/>is my son! my Arnold ! Did I ever ?</p><p>Clair. Why, no I never ! This I don’t like.
Mrs. D. But it is writ in Heaven; and it must be.
</p><p>Clair. But perhaps we may avoid it; for I tell you, widow, she
<lb/>is promised to Schuyler Walton, as fine a fellow as ever darkened
<lb/>a house door;—and there are other reasons besides.</p><p>Mrs. D. But what must be, will be ; and Mr. Walton laughs at
the science, and mocks at you.
Clair. How do you know that ? Did you ever hear him ?
Mrs. D. No, but I see it as plain as I see the whales, and every
other thing in this sumnamberlism.
</p><p>Clair. Somnambulism, my dear. If I thought so!—But what
<lb/>else do you see ? What is my dearest wish at this moment ?
<lb/>Come, tell me that; it is my last experiment for to-day.</p><p>Mrs. D. It is—spare my blushes.
Clair. Pshaw ! my dear; no one sees you, but me,
Mrs. D. That's true ; and then, I'm forced to speak ; or I would
n’t. Your dearest wish is----
Clair. —To?
Mrs.V. —Consummate our union. [Clairvoir starts back, and
Mrs. D. covers her face as if ashamed.]
Clair. The devil it is ! Why I never thought on it. Are you
very sure, Mrs. Dulruse ?
Mrs. D. Very sure, Mr. Clairvoir.
Clair. Then I don’t know my own mind.
</p><p>Mrs. D. How should you as well as I ? Did n't you give me
<lb/>the power to enter it ? I can’t help it, if you willed it so. And
<lb/>you might have a thought, you know, which was kind o’ dim to
<lb/>yourself, but which I could see ever so plain.</p><p>Clair. And that is true ; for you are fast asleep.
Mrs. D. Besides, what was you just talking of? Was’nt it of
Mr. Walton and Miss Catharine ?
Clair. True.
</p><p>Mrs. D. Well, what so near to a father as his daughter? So,
<lb/>thinking of her, you must have thought of yourself, you know, and,
<lb/>thinking of her marriage, your own must have occurred to you,
<lb/>don’t you see, and having occurred to you, why, you must have
<lb/>wished it at this moment.</p><p>Clair. Why, that I am not so sure of. But then, the science
cannot be mistaken.
</p><p>Mrs. D. Nor can I resist your will, Mr. Clairvoir. If you was
<lb/>to send me to the Bad Place, I must go there; and if you willed me
<lb/>to look into your mind, I had to do it; your power is omipertent.</p><p>Clair. Angelic creature !	[ Throws his arm in ecstasy about
her neck.] What a union of congenial spirits will ours be!
Mrs. D. Dear Mr. Clairvoir! [Throwing her arms in turn
about him.] Oh, dear me ! I shall die of shame!
Clair. Poor soul! she cannot help betraying her love in this
magnetic condition!
Mrs. D. No, in this pathetic position I cannot indeed help dis-
playing it. [kisses him.]
[At this moment, enter Walton and Catharine. They stop, confused,
and gaze at one another.]
Clair. What a life of immateriality will ours be !
Mrs. D. Yes, pure materiality ! [kissing him.]
Clair. No corporeity to obfuscate our intellectual enjoyments!
Mrs. D. No, no paupereity to puzzball our effectual enjoyments!
oh, my love ! [Hugging him ]
Clair. We shall see with magnetic vision, feel by magnetic
affinity.
Mrs. D. O, Mr. Clairvoir! spare my blushes!
</p><p>Clairvoir. —Do all things by magnetic, somnambulistic, sym-
<lb break="no"/>pathetic correspondence. A life of unsensuality, without admix-
<lb break="no"/>ture ! [Hugging.]</p><p></p><p>Mrs. D. Yes, a life of sensuality, without fixtures! Let us be-
<lb break="no"/>gin it at once. O, O, O, dear, darling, apathetic magnetiser!
<lb/>[Hugging.]</p><p>Cath. [Recovering. Aside to Walton.] What say you now?
O	my father! how I blush for him ! Let us go.
Walt. [Aside to Cath.] You are very right: a child should not
be the willing observer of its parent’s follies.
Clair. [Standing up, and disengaging himself] Eh! what’s
that ? Confusion!
Mrs. D. [Pretending to be still fast sleep ] Clairvoir, don't
leave me.
</p><p>Clair. Hush! Mrs. D.; there are persons present. Poor
<lb/>thing ! she can see and hear only me. Wonderful! Mr. Walton,
<lb/>Catharine ; don’t go. Mrs. Dulruse has been so kind as to permit
<lb/>me to manipulate her: I have made some wonderful experiments:
<lb/>would you like to see them continued ?</p><p>Cath. No, no, papa; we will go. Come [aside to Walt.] don't
stay.
</p><p>Clair. But Mr. Walton [Detaining him,] would perhaps like to
<lb/>see them, Kate. And my wish was, just this moment, (at least, I
<lb/>thought so ; though Mrs. Dulruse says it was not,) to have specta-
<lb break="no"/>tors of my great discoveries. Come, Walton, my boy, I will put
<lb/>her into communication with you. Take her hand.</p><p>Mrs. D. O no, Mr. Clairvoir; don't! I don’t want to have evil
communication with any body but you.
Walt. You had better wake her up; if she’s not so already.
</p><p>Clair. So already ! Walton! Schuyler Walton! Are you stu-
<lb break="no"/>pid ? Why, sir,—look at that excellent woman. Not a pack of
<lb/>artillery exploding in her ears would wake her; not the thunder of
<lb/>heaven, sir; yet I, I sir, poor human being as I am, I, Harry Clair-
<lb break="no"/>voir, can rouse her by the will, by the mere energy of my spirit.
<lb/>Behold !</p><p>Cath. Oh dear, my father is stark mad ! [aside.]
Clair. Awake, Mrs. Dulruse; awake to this grosser existence.
[Waving his hand magnetically over her forehead] : I will it.
</p><p>Mrs. D. [Starting and opening her eyes.] Where?—what’s
<lb/>the matter? [Rubbing her eyes, and staring round in seeming con-
<lb break="no"/>fusion] Who ?—O! I see; I am dead with shame.</p><p></p><p>Clair. You should be alive with glory, Mrs. Dulruse! [Taking
<lb/>her hand.] It is the victory of science; the triumph of immortal
<lb/>mind over corrupt matter; the exaltation of spirituality over corpo-
<lb break="no"/>rality! Walton, study magnetism; I will lend you Townshend,
<lb/>Hartshorne, Stone: your sons shall be magnetisers, and your
<lb/>daughters—</p><p>Walt, [aside to Cath.] Dulruses, I suppose.—I thank you, sir;
</p><p>I	am quite contented that they should have their simple senses like
<lb/>their father, and their every-day virtues like their lovely mother.
<lb/>[Exeunt Walt. and Cath.]</p><p></p><p>Clair. Sir! no respect for your immortal nature? no belief in the
<lb/>mind's independence of the corporeal faculties? [ Turning before
<lb/>they are quite gone.] Did you ever, Mrs. Dulruse!</p><p>Mrs. D. Why, no I never! And I must say, Mr. Clairvoir—
</p><p>Clair. That Walton treats me damned shabbily. Look you, sir I
<lb/>Eh ! gone ? In my own house ? He, I see plainly, has no sympa-
<lb break="no"/>thy with science, no congeniality of feeling.</p><p>Mrs. D. I told yon so: no congenitality for feeling at all.
<pb n="135"/>
Clair. But I’ll fix him.
Mrs. D. You’d best let Miss Catharine.
</p><p>Clair. Perhaps I may. The disrespectful!—Simple senses, in-
<lb break="no"/>deed! Mere corporality sentiment; no capability of comprehend-
<lb break="no"/>ing this mystical agent! Come, my better half.</p><p>Mrs D. [Affecting coyness.] I am not so yet, sir.
Clair. Yes, in your spirit.
Mrs. D. But my body.
Clair. I’ll magnetize that to-morrow—[Going.]
Mrs. D. But the ring will be well to keep it fast, Mr. Clairvoir.
[Tagging behind.]
</p><p>Clair. Time enough for that, my congenial spirit. Mere corpo-
<lb break="no"/>rality! no reverence for this mystic agent! [Exit, shutting the
<lb/>door after him in his abstraction.]</p><p></p><p>Mrs. D. Time enough, you old fool, you? Let me get it once;
<lb/>and I’ll make the body fact enough to you. That for your con-
<lb break="no"/>genitals ! that for your pauperalities and fiscal agents ! [Exit.]</p><p>END OF ACT FIRST.
The Valley of Unrest.
Once it smiled a silent dell
Where the people did not dwell;
They had gone unto the wars,
Trusting to the mild-eyed stars,
Nightly, from their azure towers,
To keep watch above the flowers,
In the midst of which all day
The red sun-light lazily lay.
Now each visitor shall confess
The sad valley’s restlessness.
Nothing there is motionless—
Nothing save the airs that brood
Over the magic solitude.
</p><p>Ah, by no wind are stirred those trees
<lb/>That palpitate like the chill seas
<lb/>Around the misty Hebrides!</p><p></p><p>All, by no wind those clouds are driven
<lb/>That rustle through the unquiet Heaven
<lb/>Unceasingly, from morn till even,</p><p>Over the violets there that lie
In myriad types of the human eye—
Over the lilies there that wave
And weep above a nameless grave!
They wave:—from out their fragrant tops
Eternal dews come down in drops.
They weep:—from off their delicate stems
Perennial tears descend in gems.

<lb/>region in Libya, by the borders of the river Zaire- And
<lb/>there is no quiet there, nor silence.</p><p></p><p>“ The waters of the river have a saffron and sickly hue,
<lb/>and they flow not onwards to the sea, but palpitate forever
<lb/>and forever beneath the red eye of the sun with a tumultuous
<lb/>and convulsive motion. For many miles on either side of
<lb/>the river’s oozy bed is a pale desert of gigantic water-lilies.
<lb/>They sigh one unto the other in that solitude, and stretch to-
<lb break="no"/>wards the heaven their long and ghastly necks, and nod to
<lb/>nd fro their everlasting heads. And there is an indistinct</p><p>murmur which cometh out from among them like the rush-
ing of subterrene water. And they sigh one unto the other.
</p><p>“ But there is a boundary to their realm—the boundary of
<lb/>the dark, horrible, lofty forest. There, like the waves about
<lb/>the Hebrides, the low underwood is agitated continually.
<lb/>But there is no wind throughout the heaven. And the tall
<lb/>primeval trees rock eternally hither and thither with a crash-
<lb break="no"/>ing and mighty sound. And from their high summits, one
<lb/>by one, drop everlasting dews. And at the roots strange
<lb/>poisonous flowers lie writhing in perturbed slumber. And
<lb/>overhead, with a rustling and loud noise, the gray clouds
<lb/>rush westwardly forever, until they roll, a cataract, over the
<lb/>fiery wall of the horizon. But there is no wind throughout
<lb/>the heaven. And by the shores of the river Zaire there is
<lb/>neither quiet nor silence.</p><p></p><p>“ It was night, and the rain fell; and, falling, it was rain,
<lb/>but, having fallen, it was blood. And I stood in the morass
<lb/>among the tall lilies, and the rain fell upon my head—and
<lb/>the lilies sighed one unto the other in the solemnity of their
<lb/>desolation.</p><p></p><p>“ And, all at once, the moon arose through the thin ghast-
<lb break="no"/>ly mist, and was crimson in color. And mine eyes fell upon
<lb/>a huge gray rock which stood by the shore of the river, and
<lb/>was lighted by the light of the moon. And the rock was gray,
<lb/>and ghastly, and tall,— and the rock was gray. Upon
<lb/>its front were characters engraven in the stone; and I
<lb/>walked through the morass of water-lilies, until I came close
<lb/>unto the shore, that I might read the characters upon the
<lb/>stone. But I could not decypher them. And I was going
<lb/>back into the morass, when the moon shone with a fuller red,
<lb/>and I turned and looked again upon the rock, and upon the
<lb/>characters;—and the characters were desolation.</p><p></p><p>“ And I looked upwards, and there stood a man upon the
<lb/>summit of the rock ; and I hid myself among the water-lilies
<lb/>that I might discover the actions of the man. And the man
<lb/>was tall and stately in form, and was wrapped up from his
<lb/>shoulders to his feet in the toga of old Rome. And the out-
<lb break="no"/>lines of his figure were indistinct—but his features were the
<lb/>features of a deity ; for the mantle of the night, and of the
<lb/>mist, and of the moon, and of the dew, had left uncovered
<lb/>the features of his face. And his brow was lofty with thought,
<lb/>and his eye wild with care; and, in the few furrows upon
<lb/>his cheek I read the fables of sorrow, and weariness, and dis-
<lb break="no"/>gust with mankind, and a longing after solitude.</p><p></p><p>“ And the man sat upon the rock, and leaned his head up-
<lb break="no"/>on his hand, and looked out upon the desolation. He looked
<lb/>down into the low unquiet shrubbery, and up into the tall
<lb/>primeval trees, and up higher at the rustling heaven, and in-
<lb break="no"/>to the crimson moon. And I lay close within shelter of the
<lb/>lilies, and observed the actions of the man. And the man
<lb/>trembled in the solitude;—but the night waned, and he sat
<lb/>upon the rock.</p><p></p><p>“ And the man turned his attention from the heaven, and
<lb/>looked out upon the dreary river Zaire, and upon the yellow
<lb/>ghastly waters, and upon the pale legions of the water-lilies.
<lb/>And the man listened to the sighs of the water lilies, and to
<lb/>the murmur that came up from among them. And I lay
<lb/>close within my covert and observed the actions of the man.
<lb/>And the man trembled in the solitude ;—but the night wan-
<lb break="no"/>ed and he sat upon the rock.</p><p></p><p>" Then I went down into the recesses of the morass, and
<lb/>waded afar in among the wilderness of the lilies, and called
<lb/>unto the hippopotami which dwelt among the fens in the
<lb/>recesses of the morass. And the hippopotami heard my call,
<lb/>and came, with the behemoth, unto the foot of the rock, and
<lb/>roared loudly and fearfully beneath the moon. And I lay</p><p><pb n="136"/>
</p><p>close within my covert and observed the actions of the man.
<lb/>And the man trembled in the solitude ;—but the night wan-
<lb break="no"/>ed and he sat upon the rock.</p><p></p><p>“ Then I cursed the elements with the curse of tumult;
<lb/>and a frightful tempest gathered in the heaven where, before,
<lb/>there had been no wind. And the heaven became livid
<lb/>with the violence of the tempest—and the rain beat upon
<lb/>the head of the man—and the floods of the river came down
<lb/>—and the river was tormented into foam—and the water-
<lb break="no"/>lilies shrieked within their beds—and the forest crumbled
<lb/>before the wind—and the thunder rolled—and the lightning
<lb/>fell—and the rock rocked to its foundation. And I lay close
<lb/>within my covert and observed the actions of the man. And
<lb/>the man trembled in the solitude;—but the night waned and
<lb/>he sat upon the rock.</p><p></p><p>“ Then I grew angry and cursed, with the curse of silence, 
<lb/>the river, and the lilies, and the wind, and the forest, and
<lb/>the heaven, and the thunder, and the sighs of the water-lilies.
<lb/>And they became accursed, and were still. And the moon
<lb/>ceased to totter up its pathway to heaven—and the thunder
<lb/>died away—and the lightning did not flash—and the clouds
<lb/>hung motionless—and the waters sunk to their level and re-
<lb break="no"/>mained—and the trees ceased to rock—and the water-lilies
<lb/>sighed no more—and the murmur was heard no longer from
<lb/>among them, nor any shadow of sound throughout the vast
<lb/>illimitable desert. And I looked upon the characters of the
<lb/>rock, and they were changed ;—and the characters were si-
<lb break="no"/>lence.</p><p></p><p>“ And mine eyes fell upon the countenance of the man,
<lb/>and his countenance was wan with terror. And, hurriedly,
<lb/>he raised his head from his hand, and stood forth upon the
<lb/>rock and listened. But there was no voice throughout the
<lb/>vast illimitable desert, and the characters upon the rock
<lb/>were silence. And the man shuddered, and turned his face
<lb/>away, and fled afar off, in haste, so that I beheld him no
<lb/>more.”</p><p>*********
</p><p>Now there are fine tales in the volumes of the Magi—in
<lb/>the iron-bound, melancholy volumes of the Magi. Therein, I
<lb/>say, are glorious histories of the Heaven, and of the Earth,
<lb/>and of the mighty sea—and of the Genii that over-ruled the
<lb/>sea, and the earth, and the lofty heaven. There was much
<lb/>lore too in the sayings which were said by the Sybils; and
<lb/>holy, holy things were heard of old by the dim leaves that
<lb/>trembled around Dodona—but, as Allah liveth, that fable
<lb/>which the demon told me as he sat by my side in the shad-
<lb break="no"/>ow of the tomb, I hold to be the most wonderful of all! And
<lb/>as the Demon made an end of his story, he fell back within
<lb/>the cavity of the tomb and laughed. And I could not laugh
<lb/>with the Demon, and he cursed me because I could not
<lb/>laugh. And the lynx which dwelleth forever in the tomb,
<lb/>came out therefrom, and lay down at the feet of the Demon,
<lb/>and looked at him steadily in the face.               edgar a. poe.</p><p>Critical Notices.

Genius and Character of Burns. By Professor Wilson.
</p><p>That Professor Wilson is one of the most gifted and alto-
<lb break="no"/>gether one of the most remarkable men of his day, few per-
<lb break="no"/>sons will be weak enough to deny. His ideality—his en-
<lb break="no"/>thusiastic appreciation of the beautiful, conjoined with a
<lb/>temperament compelling him into action and expression, has
<lb/>been the root of his preeminent success. Much of it, un-
<lb break="no"/>doubtedly, must be referred to that so-called moral courage</p><p></p><p>which is but the consequence of the temperament in its phy-
<lb break="no"/>sical elements. In a word, Professor Wilson is what he
<lb/>is, because he possesses ideality, energy and audacity, each
<lb/>in a very unusual degree. The first, almost unaided by the
<lb/>two latter, has enabled him to produce much impression, as
<lb/>a poet, upon the secondary or tertiary grades of the poetic
<lb/>comprehension. His “ Isle of Palms” appeals effectively, to
<lb/>all those poetic intellects in which the poetic predominates
<lb/>greatly over the intellectual element. It is a composition
<lb/>which delights through the glow of its imagination, but
<lb/>which repels (comparatively of course) through the niaiseries
<lb/>of its general conduct and construction. As a critic, Profes-
<lb break="no"/>sor Wilson has derived, as might easily be supposed, the
<lb/>greatest aid from the qualities for which we have given him
<lb/>credit—and it is in criticism especially, that it becomes very
<lb/>difficult to say which of these qualities has assisted him the
<lb/>most. It is sheer audacity, however, to which, perhaps,
<lb/>after all, he is the most particularly indebted. How little
<lb/>he owes to intellectual pre-eminence and how much to the
<lb/>mere overbearing impetuosity of his opinions, would be a
<lb/>singular subject for speculation. Nevertheless it is true,
<lb/>that this rash spirit of domination would have served, with-
<lb break="no"/>out his rich ideality, but to hurry him into contempt. Be
<lb/>this as it may, in the first requisite of a critic the Scotch Ar-
<lb break="no"/>istarchus is grossly deficient. Of one who instructs we de-
<lb break="no"/>mand, in the first instance, a certain knowledge of the prin-
<lb break="no"/>ciples which regulate the instruction. Professor Wilson's
<lb/>capability is limited to a keen appreciation of the beautiful
<lb/>and fastidious sense of the deformed. Why or how either is
<lb/>either, he never dreams of pretending to inquire, because he
<lb/>sees clearly his own inability to comprehend. He is no ana-
<lb break="no"/>lyst. He is ignorant of the machinery of his own thoughts
<lb/>and the thoughts of other men. His criticism is emphatically
<lb/>on the surface—superficial. His opinions are mere dicta—
<lb/>unsupported verba magistri—and are just or unjust at the
<lb/>variable taste of the individual who reads them. He per-
<lb break="no"/>suades—he bewilders—he overwhelms—at times he even
<lb/>argues—but there has been no period at which he ever de-
<lb break="no"/>monstrated anything beyond his own utter incapacity for
<lb/>demonstration.</p><p></p><p>His “ Genius and Character of Burns” will place Profess-
<lb break="no"/>sor Wilson in a clear, but not (for him) in the most advan-
<lb break="no"/>tageous light. We may glean from this book, however, a
<lb/>very accurate conception, if not of Burns, at least of Christo-
<lb break="no"/>pher North. His most usual tone of thought and turn of
<lb/>expression, are here happily conveyed. To the lovers of
<lb/>mere rhapsody we can recommend the volume as one likely
<lb/>to interest them ; to those who seek, in good faith, a guide
<lb/>to the real Burns—to the merits and demerits, literary and
<lb/>personal—of a man whose merits at least have been more
<lb/>grossly—more preposterously exaggerated (through a series
<lb/>of purely adventitious circumstances) than those of any man
<lb/>that ever lived upon the earth—to these seekers of the sim-
<lb break="no"/>ple truth, we say, you will look for it in vain in this volume

First American Edition. Boston : Benjamin P. Mussey.
For sale in New-York by Redfield &amp; Co.
</p><p>The poetical and critical world of England were, about
<lb/>six years ago, violently agitated (in spots) by the eruption of
<lb/>“Festus,” a Vesuvius-cone at least—if not an Ӕtna—in
<lb/>the literary cosmos. It is only lately, however,—within the
<lb/>last eight or nine months, perhaps,—that anything more
<lb/>than a mere rumor of the eruption has made its way to us.</p><p>This is the more strange, since “Festus" is, beyond ques-
<pb n="137" break="no" />
</p><p>tion, a poem of the most remarkable power, and since, in
<lb/>general, we are ludicrously on the alert to catch the echoes
<lb/>of the British opinion in respect to even the most nonsensical
<lb/>books.</p><p></p><p>We shall speak of “Festus” hereafter, at length, as its
<lb/>peculiarities deserve. At present, we have read it only in
<lb/>snatches. In the meantime we may observe first, that its
<lb/>author is, or was, at the period of its original publication, a
<lb/>very young man, and secondly that his work has been laud-
<lb break="no"/>ed in no stinted measure, by many of the best authorities in
<lb/>Great Britain. Bulwer, for example, calls it “a most re-
<lb break="no"/>markable and magnificent production.” Mrs. Hall says, “It
<lb/>contains some of the most wonderful things I ever read.”
<lb/>Horne, the author of “ Orion” (no common man and no com-
<lb break="no"/>mon poem) speaks of its “unrepressed vigor of imagination”
<lb/>—its “ splendor of great and original imagery”—its “ passion
<lb/>of poetry.”</p><p></p><p>The design of “ Festus” may be stated, in brief, as the
<lb/>demonstration of the necessity of Evil. We quote the con-
<lb break="no"/>cluding Sonnet, which the poet affectedly calls “L’Envoi.”</p><p>Read this, world ! He who writes is dead to thee,
But still lives in these leaves. He spake inspired:
Night and day thought came unhelped, undesired,
</p><p>Like blood to his heart. The course of study he
<lb/>Went through with was the soul-rack. The degree
<lb/>He took was high : it was wise wretchedness.</p><p></p><p>He suffered perfectly, and gained no less
<lb/>A prize than in his own tom heart to see
<lb/>A few bright seeds: he sowed them—hoped them truth.</p><p>The autumn of that seed is in these pages.
God was with him, and bade old Time to the youth
Unclench his heart, and teach the book of ages.
Peace to thee, world!—farewell!—May God the Power,
And God the Love—and God the Grace be ours !
</p><p>This sonnet happily conveys much of the prevalent tone of
<lb/>the whole poem—its imperiousness—its egotism—its energy
<lb/>—its daring—its ruggedness—its contempt of law in great
<lb/>things and small. Observe the defective rhyme in the con-
<lb break="no"/>clusion—a straw to show the way of the wind.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Mussey is to be thanked for the very handsome and

Hid in the forest, faraway ;
A magic fount it was, in sooth,
Where he who stooped above the brink,
And laved his brow, and bent to drink,
Though he were bowed with years before,
The semblance of unchanging youth
Thenceforth would wear forevermore.
But he alone hath reached the goal,
Who, turning from the world aside,
’Mid the green places of the soul,
Hath sought the pure, life-giving tide
That wells with faith, and love and truth,
The fountain of perpetual youth.
The Drama.
</p><p>Park Theatre.—We attended this establishment on
<lb/>Saturday evening to witness the first appearance (in Ameri-
<lb break="no"/>ca) of Mrs. Eland in the character of Pauline, in Bulwer’s
<lb/>popular play “ The Lady of Lyons.”</p><p></p><p>Before remarking upon the lady's performance, we cannot
<lb/>but make a few observations upon the circumstances of her 
<lb/>first appearance. It would be impossible to select, through- 
<lb/>out the entire year, an evening so entirely disadvantageous,
<lb/>as the one chosen for Mrs. Bland’s debut. In the first
<lb/>place, Saturday night, even upon ordinary occasions, is con-
<lb break="no"/>fessedly the worst night of the week ; but Saturday night 
<lb/>after a star engagement is but another term for empty bench-
<lb break="no"/>es. Mr. Hackett had been playing all the week up to Friday,
<lb/>and the Keans had been announced for several days to ap-
<lb break="no"/>pear on the following Monday. Could circumstances have
<lb/>been contrived more calculated to damn for ever the first ef-
<lb break="no"/>forts of a lady in a new country ? We cannot believe that
<lb/>the selection of the night was intended as a slight to Mrs,
<lb/>Bland, because it would be against the interests of the Man-
<lb break="no"/>ager, who would, one would think, take every opportunity of</p><p></p><p>ager, who would, one would think, take every opportunity
<lb/>of placing the principal members of his establishment, in as
<lb/>prominent and favorable a position as possible. We have
<lb/>thought of every likely motive for such injurious and un-
<lb break="no"/>fair conduct, and the only conclusion we will arrive at is,
<lb/>that the strongest attraction which could be procured with
<lb/>the least possible trouble, and without reference to the injury
<lb/>likely to be sustained by the said attractor, was put forward
<lb/>—or rather backward—on the worst possible night. We re-
<lb break="no"/>gret this for the sake of the Lady—we regret it for the sake
<lb/>of the Manager, and we regret it also, for the sake of the
<lb/>Public, who have been deprived, for a time, of witnessing a
<lb/>performance of the highest merit. We trust that Mr. Simp-
<lb break="no"/>son will afford us an early opportunity of seeing Mrs. Bland
<lb/>in some of her most prominent characters. The Lady of
<lb/>Lyons has been represented so frequently of late, that we are
<lb/>surprised to find that an audience can be collected to wit-
<lb break="no"/>ness it.</p><p></p><p>The character of Pauline is easily defined, and though but
<lb/>rarely represented as the author designed, is still a creation
<lb/>consistent throughout. Her one great capacity is—Love:
<lb/>deep, earnest and devoted love. Before this great principle
<lb/>of her life has been developed, pride which is not native to
<lb/>her mind, has been engrafted there, but harmonizes not at
<lb/>all with the confiding nature of her true woman’s heart.
<lb/>This pride has been severely shocked at the knowledge that
<lb/>a peasant has dared to raise his hopes to her ; but it is sooth-
<lb break="no"/>ed, comforted and excited, by the homage of a Prince’s heart.
<lb/>When in the first flush of her almost unimagined happiness
<lb/>the fatal truth breaks in upon her—that she has been deceiv-
<lb break="no"/>ed—duped—exposed to the mockery and contempt of the
<lb/>whole city, this pride, in a great struggle with her humble
<lb/>nature, seems for a time to gain the mastery, when with
<lb/>bitter scorn she asks her deceiver if this is his palace, &amp;c.,
<lb/>&amp;c.; but this passes quickly away, yielding imperceptibly
<lb/>to the finer emotions of her soul, until it sinks forever beneath
<lb/>the power of her devoted love. This we think reconciles the
<lb/>seeming inconsistencies in her character ; such, for instance
<lb/>as yielding her hand to Beauseant while her heart is truly
<lb/>and only Melnotte’s: for how could one of her wholesouled-
<lb break="no"/>ness refuse to sacrifice herself to save the honor of the au-
<lb break="no"/>thor of her being, who, to use her own sentiments—“ refus-
<lb break="no"/>ed her nothing, and never spoke a harsh or unkind word.”*
<lb/>Mrs. Bland’s conception of the character was entirely na-
<lb break="no"/>tural from the beginning to end. There was no straining
<lb/>after effect—no points forced from their natural insignificance
<lb/>to produce a momentary sensation,—all was as inartificial as
<lb/>though the action were real, and she the thing she seemed.

<lb/>is discovered, and the bitter scorn mingled with the hysteri-
<lb break="no"/>cal laugh—the momentary triumph of pride over a yielding
<lb/>nature, was a perfect masterpiece of art, and electrical in its
<lb/>effects from its direct truthfulness. In the fourth and fifth
<lb/>acts she was equally successful, carrying the audience com-
<lb break="no"/>pletely with her, and inducing a unanimous and vociferous
<lb/>call for her re-appearance at the fall of the curtain.</p><p></p><p>Mrs. Bland has fine natural advantages—a well propor-
<lb break="no"/>tioned and commanding figure—a truly intellectual face, ca-
<lb break="no"/>pable of every variety of expression—a voice of rare quality,
<lb/>well educated, and an easy and graceful carriage. All these
<lb/>are used to admirable advantage through the perfect knowl-
<lb break="no"/>edge which Mrs. Bland possesses of by-play—stage tact, &amp;c.</p><p></p><p>*For these comments on the performances at the Park we are in-
<lb break="no"/>debted to our musical editor. We do not agree with him at all points.
<lb/>In especial, we see no necessity for reconciling the inconsistencies of
<lb/>Pauline.—Ed. B. J.</p><p><pb n="139"/>
</p><p>Mr. Dyott was the Claude of the evening. It is an ardu-
<lb break="no"/>ous task to undertake even an easy character, after a success-
<lb break="no"/>ful and highly popular actor has made the part his own; but
<lb/>in the present instance Mr. Dyott had to contend with a diffi-
<lb break="no"/>cult character, and against the extraordinary impression
<lb/>made by Mr. Anderson in the same role, upon the New York
<lb/>public. Bearing these facts in mind, we feared for him.
<lb/>The fear was, however, needless, for he acquitted himself
<lb/>with much credit. He read the part, throughout, correctly,
<lb/>and in many passages imparted much emphasis and passion
<lb/>to his delivery. But it was evident to us that the part had
<lb/>not been duly studied—the points had not been weighed and
<lb/>settled in his mind—there were frequent evidences of haste
<lb/>both in his action and delivery, and in speaking, the inflec-
<lb break="no"/>tions of the voice so necessary to produce effective contrasts,
<lb/>were but little attended to, when most they were needed.
<lb/>These faults would hardly have appeared, had Mr. Dyott
<lb/>been afforded more time to digest the character: such at
<lb/>least is our opinion founded upon the general excellence of
<lb/>his personation.</p><p></p><p>Mrs. Vernon played the aristocratic and low-born woman
<lb/>in her usual excellent style, excepting that in one or two
<lb/>portions, especially in the third act, her manner bordered
<lb/>rather upon the caricature.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Bass is an admirable actor, and imparted much blunt
<lb/>dignity to the character of Damas. The accident which has
<lb/>deprived him, for the present, of the use of his right arm,
<lb/>has also prevented a full display of his powers.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Fleming is a careful reader and a good actor, and if
<lb/>he would impart more vigor to his manner, and strive to ap-
<lb break="no"/>pear less mysterious, his style would be improved and he
<lb/>would stand a fair chance of becoming a distinguished fa-
<lb break="no"/>vorite.</p><p></p><p>Mr. and Mrs. Charles Kean appeared at the Park. They
<lb/>made their debut in the Gamester. The house was crowded
<lb/>to excess, and as the management does not set apart any ac-
<lb break="no"/>commodation for the prominent members of the public press,
<lb/>we were unwilling to endure the crowding of a thousand in-
<lb break="no"/>furiated (theatrically) people ; consequently we can give no
<lb/>notice of the performance. Their success was, however,
<lb/>complete. Mrs. Kean was deeply affected by the cordial and
<lb/>enthusiastic reception she met with. She deserves it all.</p><p></p><p>The English opera company succeed the Keans in a couple
<lb/>of weeks, and the opera chosen for their appearance is the
<lb/>English version of the Sonnambula. It is old—very old:
<lb/>hackneyed, very hackneyed, and has become to the moderns
<lb/>what the Artaxerxes of Arne was to the singers of twenty
<lb/>years ago—namely, a trial opera. The system of appearing
<lb/>in old operas, is, however, judicious: for if a debutante
<lb/>should appear in a new, but unsuccessful work, the chances
<lb/>are that the failure of one would involve the failure of both.</p><p></p><p>Miss Delcy, will, we think, become a favorite in America,
<lb/>for she is young, showy and attractive in her manner, be-
<lb break="no"/>sides being a singer of no ordinary merit.</p><p></p><p>We gladly avail ourselves of the author’s permission to
<lb/>occupy, this week, some portion of our usual space under the
<lb/>head of “ The Drama," with an extract from a forthcoming
<lb/>Work—“ The Stage, or Sketches of Dramatic Art," By Jas.
<lb/>E. Murdoch.</p><p></p><p>The Author’s Connection with the Stage.—All I wish,
<lb/>as one naturally anxious for the success and the respectabi-
<lb break="no"/>lity of my own profession, is to suggest the immense advan-
<lb break="no"/>tages resulting to every player from a just ambition in his</p><p></p><p>daily pursuit; and as one who have identified myself with
<lb/>the success of the drama in our country, I feel impelled to
<lb/>speak on a subject so intimately connected with its advance-
<lb break="no"/>ment. Of my own attainments, I have nothing to boast.
<lb/>Commencing life prematurely, like many others fascinated
<lb/>by the stage in youth, the daily toils of an arduous profes-
<lb break="no"/>sional life have left me little leisure for study ; and although
<lb/>I had hoped to find, during the lime in which I temporarily
<lb/>relinquished the stage, an auspicious opportunity of self-cul-
<lb break="no"/>ture, in the pursuits of an elocutionist, the taste for the ac-
<lb break="no"/>complishments of reading and speaking I found not yet suffi-
<lb break="no"/>ciently diffused in the community, to furnish either the lei-
<lb break="no"/>sure or the compensation requisite for the enjoyment of a
<lb/>liberal scale of intellectual advantages, in connection with
<lb/>that mode of life.</p><p></p><p>The Author’s Experience as an Elocutionist.—So little,
<lb/>indeed, is the art of elocution yet appreciated, that, as a pro-
<lb break="no"/>fession, it is still more precarious and inadequate in its remu-
<lb break="no"/> merations than even the stage, which is proverbially so ; the
<lb/> greatest and the most original treatise on the subject (a
<lb/>work in which its author, Dr. James Rush, reflects honor on
<lb/>his country,) is little read and less understood; and my own
<lb/>humble attempt to render elocution a permanent branch of
<lb/>education, even in the intelligent city of Boston,—although
<lb/>I was aided in my endeavors by the exertions of a gentleman
<lb/>long known as a practical rhetorician as well as elocutionist,</p><p></p><p> —was not sustained; nor was the expensive undertaking
<lb/> countenanced, in which I endeavored to combine,—in an ap-
<lb break="no"/>propriate course of education embracing ample and eligible
<lb/>opportunities for the purpose,—the cultivation of the voice
<lb/>with a regular system of physical exercise.*</p><p></p><p>The Author’s Return to the Stage.—The idea, there-
<lb break="no"/>fore, of obtaining an adequate income, or of enjoying leisure
<lb/>for self-culture, in such circumstances, proved impracticable.
<lb/>Still, during the few years in which I withdrew from the
<lb/>stage, every moment that could be seized for such purposes
<lb/>I have endeavored to turn to account; and, whatever verdict
<lb/>may be pronounced on my future professional efforts, I shall
<lb/>never regret the results of a temporary change of pursuit,
<lb/>which has enabled me to look, at least, a little more closely
<lb/>into our dramatic literature, and to acquire juster views of
<lb/>its depth and extent, together with a deeper and more intel-
<lb break="no"/>ligent relish of its beauties.</p><p></p><p>Of one thing more I can speak distinctly, from my present
<lb/>point of view: and it is in this light that I hope to be under-
<lb break="no"/>stood. The more an actor devotes himself to the collateral
<lb/>studies of his profession, the more clearly will he see how
<lb/>high and noble are its objects, and how fully it is entitled to
<lb/>the best exertions of a life, as the merited price of success in</p><p></p><p>* The above topics I cannot pass without an expression of acknow-
<lb break="no"/>ledgment to two individuals:—Mr. William Russell, the rhetorician
<lb/>above referred to, for invaluable aid in my course of personal study
<lb/>with him—and Mr. N. Houghton, whose regard for subjects beyond
<lb/>the mere range of mercantile life, and whose liberal and philanthropic
<lb/>spirit, enabled me to offer to the citizens of Boston the opportunity of
<lb/>a superior establishment for physical and elocutionary education. Mr.
<lb/>H.’s interest in these subjects, and others of a kindred nature, has, in
<lb/>this, as in many other instances, evinced the benefits resulting to a
<lb/> community from the generous spirit of individuals in private life, who
<lb/>contribute the most effectual of all aids to the mental welfare of their
<lb/>fellow-citizens, by imparting the requisite means of establishing and
<lb/>maintaining institutions devoted to the culture and improvement of
<lb/> humanity.</p><p></p><p>To several eminent members, both of the medical and clerical pro-
<lb break="no"/>fessions, who gave their sanction to my endeavors to aid the depart,
<lb/>ment of physical education, I feel under peculiar obligations, as well
<lb/>as to Mr. Abbott Lawrence, Mr. George S. Hillard, Mr. Peleg W.
<lb/>Chandler, and other individuals, who, as parents, or as patrons of in-
<lb break="no"/> tellectual objects, exerted themselves on behalf of my purposes. I
<lb/>cannot but hope that it may fall to some other person than myself to
<lb/>establish and maintain the systematic cultivation of the voice, as an
<lb/> acknowledged branch of education.</p><p><pb n="140"/>
</p><p>its pursuit. I shall not, I think, incur the imputation of cant,
<lb/>when I declare my own conviction, that acting, as the living
<lb/>presentation of poetry, of sentiment, and of character, is one
<lb/>of the most elevated and beneficial occupations to which a
<lb/>man can devote himself. Invited by a peculiar combination
<lb/>of circumstances, I have resumed the stage as my vocation,
<lb/>and shall esteem myself happy to contribute the imperfect
<lb/>but zealous exertions of an individual, to promote its purpo-
<lb break="no"/>ses, whether within the limits of my own profession, or in
<lb/>general society.</p><p></p><p>Depression or the Theatre in America.—The drama of
<lb/>our own country has usually been imported; and, with its
<lb/>uses, we have received its abuses.</p><p></p><p>We claim Shakspeare as our birthright, and honor him
<lb/>with enthusiastic admiration ; but when our transatlantic
<lb/>brethren neglect him, to follow in golden multitudes at the
<lb/>heels of a French dancer, the signal is taken here. The star
<lb/>of Shakspeare wanes, and the genius of Terpsichore reigns
<lb/>sovereign of the ascendant.</p><p></p><p>The taste for the drama subsided for a time, while French
<lb/>dancing, in all the voluptuousness of the Parisian style,
<lb/>usurped its place. Giants, monsters, posture-masters, and 
<lb/>the games of the circus, with other equally intellectual exhi-
<lb break="no"/>bitions, have occupied the theatre; while the neglected
<lb/>drama was brought to their degraded level, and made to
<lb/>bear the odium of those who disgrace its name and desecrate
<lb/>its temple.</p><p></p><p>That the theatre has declined within the last few years,
<lb/>no one can deny; and why is this? Simply because the
<lb/>age is before it. Moral reform is the order of the day; and
<lb/>the enemies of the stage have attacked it upon the ground
<lb/>that it encourages immorality. Portions of the theatre are
<lb/>set apart for the public exhibition of the most abandoned of
<lb/>the human race, while the passions are excited by the sale of
<lb/>spirituous liquors. Has either of these objectionable facts
<lb/>any legitimate connection with the stage or the drama ? Pub-
<lb break="no"/>lic sentiment answers No! Then let these abuses be abo-
<lb break="no"/>lished ! That they have been so long in existence, is no rea-
<lb break="no"/>son for their continuance. No longer let the pure atmos-
<lb break="no"/>phere of intellectual recreation be contaminated by grossness
<lb/>and debauchery; but drive them out, to seek their congenial
<lb/>sphere.</p><p></p><p>Prejudices against the theatre have been yearly gaining
<lb/>ground from these causes, and many of the best friends of
<lb/>the drama have been driven from the theatre. Let the ban-
<lb break="no"/>ner of reform be raised, and the public will flock to the stan-
<lb break="no"/>dard. Let the abuses of the theatre be removed, and the
<lb/>spirit of the drama will shine forth with increased brightness.</p><p></p><p>Let men of cultivated intellect assert their right to enjoy
<lb/>in its purity their favorite recreation. Let them enforce their
<lb/>just claim in this respect. Let them diffuse the influence of
<lb/>their own taste around them by proper appeals to general
<lb/>feeling. Let all who are connected with the press, espe-
<lb break="no"/>cially, discharge the duty which, in this relation, they owe
<lb/>to the community, as the organs of public sentiment, and the
<lb/>just guardians of its purity.</p><p></p><p>The reforms to which I allude have been attempted and
<lb/>carried out, with at least temporary success, in all cases in
<lb/>which due energy and perseverance have been displayed.
<lb/>For my own part, I entertain no doubt that, in a short time,
<lb/>the reformation will be universal and permanent. The pre-
<lb break="no"/>sent is a most auspicious moment for action. We see, in all
<lb/>our large cities, an incipient renovation and resuscitation of
<lb/>the theatre, and the most cheering indications of its prospe-
<lb break="no"/>rity. Now is the happy moment to stamp a new character 
<lb/>on every department of dramatic affairs.</p><p></p><p>The following statement evinces that the public, as well
<lb/>as the manager, has a part to perform in every effectual reno-
<lb break="no"/>vation of the theatre.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Macready entered upon a lease of Drury Lane theatre,
<lb/>in the fall of 1841, and issued a prospectus dated October 4,
<lb/>in which this passage occurs :—</p><p></p><p>The purposes to which the saloons and lobbies of London theatres
<lb/>have been too frequently appropriated, have seemed to justify objec-
<lb break="no"/>tions to dramatic entertainments, and have become a national reproach
<lb/>among the well-informed of other countries. This cause of complaint
<lb/>will not be suffered to exist in Drury Lane theatre. Arrangements
<lb/>will be made and regulations enforced, not only to secure the respect-
<lb break="no"/>able frequenters of the theatre from annoyance during the perform-
<lb break="no"/>ance, but to restore to them an agreeable walk for promenading and
<lb/>refreshment, without danger of offence to propriety or delicacy.</p><p></p><p>This was carried out to the letter. In June, 1842, a scur-
<lb break="no"/>rilous article on Macready and his management, appeared in
<lb/>the “ Weekly Despatch,” alleging among other things the
<lb/>failure of his plan for clearing the lobbies,—that the price
<lb/>admitted any well-dressed woman, of whatever character, to
<lb/>the side of the respectable ladies whom Macready had drawn
<lb/>into the lobbies ; in fine, that “ Mr. M. ought to be ashamed
<lb/>of himself for attempting to raise money by destroying the
<lb/>demarcations between the unsullied and the most polluted of
<lb/>the sex.” Macready instituted a libel suit against the pro-
<lb break="no"/>prietors of the paper, and the jury found for the plaintiff five
<lb/>pounds damages.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Macready closed his management of Drury Lane in
<lb/>June, 1843. In his concluding address, he makes no mention
<lb/>of his reform of the lobbies—unless it is implied in this de-
<lb break="no"/>claration :</p><p></p><p>In conclusion let me merely add, that I have endeavored to re-
<lb break="no"/>deem, throughout my management, every pledge of my introductory
<lb/>address.</p><p></p><p>The admission of improper persons at theatres, as at other
<lb/>places of public resort, would, if the proposed arrangement
<lb/>were adopted, be left to the responsibility of the gentleman
<lb/>who accompanied any female, and by that fact endorsed her
<lb/>respectability.</p><p>The Bowery is not doing quite so well as in the beginning.
A new spectacle, however, is in preparation.
</p><p>We stepped in at The Chatham on Monday night to see
<lb/>Booth in Pescara and Jerry Sneak. How The Apostate
<lb/>maintains its place on the stage, is inconceivable. It has not
<lb/>a single redeeming feature—at least if the Chatham Street
<lb/>representation of it is a fair one. Mr. Booth did not impress
<lb/>us at all—except in the distinctness of his enunciation and
<lb/>his general ease and freedom from rant. He has a sad man-
<lb break="no"/>nerism—that of putting his hands to his ears upon all occa-
<lb break="no"/>sions. His Jerry Sneak is a pitiable spectacle.</p><p>Musical Department.
</p><p>Oratorio of the Seven Sleepers.—We promised our readers
<lb/>last week some account of this grand Composition, which is

</p><p>During the persecution of the Christians by the Emperor
<lb/>Decius, the Seven Brothers, sons of Anicianus, fled away
<lb/>from Ephesus, and took refuge in a Cave upon Mount Celion.
<lb/>Their place of refuge was, however, discovered, and, by or-
<lb break="no"/>der of the tyrant, the mouth of the Cave was closed up with
<lb/>massive stone.</p><p></p><p>The scene of action is first on Mount Celion; then in
<lb/>Ephesus, and lastly on Mount Celion. The time is during the
<lb/>reign of the Emperor Theodosius.</p><p></p><p>The first scene discovers the Proconsul Antipater, and
<lb/>Honoria his wife, upon Mount Celion, directing the Shepherds
<lb/>who are employed in opening the mouth of the Cave of the 
<lb/>Seven Sleepers. While thus engaged Antipater relates
<lb/>the persecution of the brothers, and of Anicianus who was
<lb/>his (Antipater’s) ancestor. When the work is finished the
<lb/>characters go out, to join at Ephesus the grand procession of
<lb/>Priests and Warriors appointed to proceed to the Cave, to
<lb/>disinter the Martyrs’ bones and carry them in honor to the
<lb/>city.</p><p></p><p>When the Cave is opened, a slow chorale is heard and one
<lb/>by one the Brothers come from within. Like Rip Van
<lb/>Winkle they awoke unconscious of the lapse of years—two
<lb/>centuries appearing unto them, but as the passage of a sin-
<lb break="no"/>gle night. They return thanks to heaven for their wonderful
<lb/>preservation from the persecuting Decius. Malchus the
<lb/>youngest brother, offers to go to the city, in order to procure
<lb/>food. He arrives there just as the High Priest is blessing the
<lb/>Standards of the Warriors who are going forth to fight the
<lb/>Persians. He stares around him in wild amazement at the
<lb/>altered appearance of the city—the strange dresses attract
<lb/>his eye—the language seems new to him, and the emblems
<lb/>of the cross on every side, overwhelm him with astonish-
<lb break="no"/>ment. The people mistake him for a Persian Spy, and
<lb/>watch him. He enters a baker’s shop and offers a gold solidus
<lb/>for bread. This confirms them in their suspicions and they
<lb/>seize him and bear him before Antipater. His simple tale
<lb/>is quickly told, and bears so much the stamp of truth that
<lb/>the Proconsul believes it, and the people rush with feverish
<lb/>impatience to behold the wonder on Mount Celion. They
<lb/>arrive and do honor to the Saints whom heaven has so mira-
<lb break="no"/>culously preserved through ages of time. Honoria entreats
<lb/>them to leave the Cave and revisit their home in Ephesus;
<lb/>but Johannes thus replies;—</p><p>God be with you ; but we are not permitted
To return and tread our halls again ;
Here is our repose, in holy quiet,
Till the dead are summoned from their graves.
For the Lord's good spirit has revealed it;—
As an emblem are we sent to you,
Of that morning, when, by him awakened,
All our race from darksome graves shall rise.
Sleep again appears to be stealing over the senses of the
Seven Brothers—they utter with one voice
Now with strokes of unseen wings, approaching
Sleep is fanning us yet once again.
They fall asleep, and are borne into the Sacred Cavern, by
the awe-stricken and wondering people.
</p><p>Such is the plot of the Oratorio; a finer subject could
<lb/>scarcely have been selected. It is full of deep and thrilling
<lb/>interest, and abounds with highly wrought dramatic situa-
<lb break="no"/>tion. The Music is of a high character; it displays many
<lb/>passages which could scarcely be excelled. It is melodious,
<lb/>partaking in a large degree of the exquisite peculiarities of
<lb/>Haydn’s school—Dr. Loewe being, we believe, a pupil of
<lb/>that great Master.</p><p>We have not a doubt of the popularity of the Seven
Sleepers, for the subject affords ample scope for striking
contrasts, and the Composer has availed himself of these ad-
vantages to their uttermost limits.
</p><p>We have not, as yet, seen an announcement of the names
<lb/>of the principal performers; we shall probably receive them
<lb/>for our next number. The chorus will number over one
<lb/>hundred and twenty-five efficient members; the band will
<lb/>be numerous and carefully selected. Mr. George Loder will
<lb/>conduct the whole, and Mr. H. C. Timm will be at the
<lb/>Organ.</p><p></p><p>We trust that our readers in the city will support, with all
<lb/>their interest, this praise-worthy attempt to produce a fine
<lb/> Composition, upon a scale of excellence hitherto unattained
<lb/>in this country.</p><p></p><p>The French Opera at Niblo’s continues to be highly suc-
<lb break="no"/>cessful. Nothing new has, as yet, been produced ; but Ma-
<lb break="no"/>niello and Les Huguenots continue to prove sufficient to
<lb/>attract crowded audiences. Several novelties are in prepar-
<lb break="no"/>ation. Among others La Reine de Cypre is in a forward
<lb/>state of preparation.</p><p></p><p>We are strong in the hope that the Manager, Mr. Davis,
<lb/>will find it for his interest to remain with us during the
<lb/>winter months. We feel certain that he would meet with
<lb/>support altogether beyond his expectations, if he bases them
<lb/>upon the result of the recent season at the Park Theatre.
<lb/>The intelligence of New York requires such an establish-
<lb break="no"/>ment, and the musical taste is sufficiently influential and ex-
<lb break="no"/>tended to support it amply. The present company has gain-
<lb break="no"/>ed the respect of every one. The public is not pestered, an-
<lb break="no"/>noyed and disgusted by petty bickerings, grand quarrels,
<lb/>newspaper warfare, as in the case of the last Italian com-
<lb break="no"/>pany at Palmo’s; but on the contrary everything is peace-
<lb break="no"/>ful, well arranged—in short it is a family party showing
<lb/>only its amiable and attractive side to the public.</p><p></p><p>If it were known that Mr. Davis could remain here with
<lb/>his company during the winter, there would be no lack of
<lb/>the right class of people to ensure his success. We want
<lb/>to hear Gustclave, Lestocq, La Lac des Fees, Zampa, Pre aux
<lb/>Clercs, L’Edair, and other charming French works, and we
<lb/>look to the company at present here as the only means of
<lb/>gaining our wish.</p><p>Editorial Miscellany.
</p><p>Advertisements, this week, have trenched rather more
<lb/>than we could wish upon our space for literary matter. For
<lb/>this very “ flattering ill” however, we shall speedily find
<lb/>a remedy in the enlargement of our “Journal” by one half.
<lb/>We propose to give, very shortly, new type and eight addi-
<lb break="no"/>tional pages.</p><p></p><p>Bolles’ Phonographic Dictionary has “controvertible”
<lb/>and not—“ controvertibility”—“ self-conceited” and not “ self-
<lb break="no"/>conceitedly"—“worldly-minded ” and not “worldly-minded-
<lb break="no"/>ly.” Are these omissions intentional ? We presume not.</p><p></p><p> Some of its definitions are inaccurate, if not odd—whether
<lb/>these are adopted from other works, we have not leisure to
<lb/>ascertain. For example; “jealousy” is defined as “suspi-
<lb break="no"/>cion in love”—but is it not rather the passion aroused by sus-
<lb break="no"/>picion in love? “Museum” is defined “a collection of
<lb/>learned curiosities”—but neither Tom Thumb, nor the Ana-
<lb break="no"/>conda are particularly “learned.” A printer is said to be
<lb/>“one who prints books;” then one who merely prints hand-
<lb break="no"/>bills is no printer at all. A regicide is described as a “ n-ur-
<lb break="no"/>derer of one's king”—and yet the murderer of anybody’s king
<lb/> is still a regicide.</p><p><pb n="143"/>
</p><p>In a Dictionary, if anywhere, we look for rigorous accuracy
<lb/>of definition. We are not finding fault with Mr. Bolles’
<lb/>work in especial. He is no worse than his predecessors.</p><p></p><p>The subjoined jeu d'esprit has been “going the rounds
<lb/>of the papers” for some time, and we had intended to copy it
<lb/>before—but in some manner it escaped us. The editorial
<lb/>prefix (very generally published with it) is that of “ The
<lb/>Morning News”—with which paper we thoroughly agree as
<lb/>to the cleverness of the verses.</p><p>THE RETORT.
</p><p>The Rev. Arthur Coxe’s Saul, a Mystery, having been condemned
<lb/>in no measured terms by Poe of the Broadway Journal, and Green of
<lb/>the Emporium, a writer in the Hartford Columbian retorts as follows,
<lb/>which strikes us as being very clever:</p><p>A REVERSAL.
An entertaining history
Entitled “ Saul a mystery,”
Has recently been published by the Rev. Arthur Coxe.
The poem is dramatic,
And the wit of it is attic,
And its teachings are emphatic of the doctrines orthodox.
But Mr. Poe, the poet,
Declares he cannot go it—
That the book is very stupid—or something of that sort:
And Green of the Empori
Um, tells a kindred story,
And “ swears like any tory” that it isn’t worth a groat.
But maugre all their croaking,
Of the “ raven”—and the joking
Of the verdant little fellow of the used to be review,
The People, in derision
Of their impudent decision,
Have declared without division, that the“ Mystery will do.”
</p><p>The truth, of course, rather injures an epigram than other-
<lb break="no"/>wise ; and nobody will think the worse of the one above
<lb/>when we say that we have expressed no opinion whatever
<lb/>of “ Saul.” Give a dog a bad name, &amp;c. Whenever a book
<lb/>is abused, it is taken for granted that it is we who have been
<lb/>abusing it. Mr. Coxe has written some very beautiful po-
<lb break="no"/>ems, and “Saul” may be one of them for anything that we
<lb/>know to the contrary. As yet we have not found time to
<lb/>read the poem —which, to say the truth, is an unconscionably
<lb/>long one.</p><p></p><p>Mr. J. S. Redfield, of this city, has in press “The Prose
<lb/>and Poetical Works of N. P. Willis”—complete in one large
<lb/>volume, octavo. The Harpers have nearly ready a beautiful
<lb/>octavo entitled “ Biographical and Critical Miscellanies, by
<lb/>William H. Prescott.” It will be uniform with the “ Ferdi-
<lb break="no"/>nand and Isabella.” The Contents are Charles Brockden

</p><p>“ Of all the humorists, Hood was the most poetical. When deal-

<lb break="no"/>wailing the suppression of his cry, or a mother searching through St.
<lb/>Giles’s for her lost infant, or a Miss Kilmansegg’s golden childhood—
<lb/>there was hardly a verse in which some touches of heart, or some play
<lb/>of fancy, did not beckon the laughing reader away into far other
<lb/>worlds than the jester’s.”—London Athenaum.</p><p></p><p>“ The smile and the sigh were ever blended together: the laugh at
<lb/>the grotesque idea and whimsical imagination, (rarely seeing objects
<lb/>as others saw them,) and the tear which must now on such pathetic
<lb/>narratives as Eugene Aram or the Old Elm Tree. Without a parallel
<lb/>and original as Hood was in the ludicrous, his more enduring fame
<lb/>will rest on the exquisitely humane and simply compassionate.”—Lite-
<lb break="no"/>rary Gazette.</p><p></p><p>“ He was the inventer of a new sort of guano to fertilize men’s
<lb/>minds, and to make them produce larger crops of good actions: or rath-

J. F. BROWNE &amp; CO.
MANUFACTURERS OP THE
IMPROVED PATENT DOUBLE-ACTION HARP,
By Royal Letters Patent, London. Established 1810. (Many years with Erard,
J.F. BROWNE respectfully informs his Friends and the Musical World, that he has established himself for
the manufacture and importation of these very beautiful instruments, at
281 BROADWAY, and 73 1-2 CHAMBERS STREET.
His arrangements are snch as to enable him to transact business at European prices, thereby saving purchasers the high duties imposed by
Tariff on these Instruments.
</p><p>J. F. Browne would observe, these Harps are constructed on the most approved principles, with all the modern improvements of London and
<lb/>Paris, are unequalled in brilliancy of tone, fineness of touch, and perfectness of mechanism. Particular care is taken to fit them for the ex-
<lb break="no"/>tremes of climate in this country, in which respect they will be found far superior to any of European manufacture, imported in the usual way.</p><p>These Harps are patronized by the elite of musical taste and professional talent in Europe; among the latter, he would mention N. C Bochsa,
who invariably selects from this establishment.
J. F. Browne begs to offer the opinions of some of the first professional talent in this country.
</p><p>Mr. J. F. Browne, Sir :—Having had for several years past, the opportunity of making a professional use of your Harps, and of testing
<lb/>their qualities, it affords me pleasure to certify, that in point of tone, workmanship, and above all, a solidity that stands proof against the in-
<lb break="no"/>constancy of our trying climate, they have in all cases given me the most entire satisfaction. I am yours, CHARLES THIBAULT,
<lb/>January, 1845.	No. 40 Beach Street, N. Y.</p><p></p><p>Dear Sir :—I write to exrress the delight I experienced in performing on one of your Harps at Sig. Casella’s Concert in this city. The
<lb/>mechanism is perfect, and the quality of Tone certainly superior to any harp I have heard for many years. I remember my old Master,
<lb/>Bochsa, always gave the preference to your Harps, indeed he himself used no other.	Yours, most truly, H. G. TRUST.</p><p>Philadelphia, March 4th, 1844?
</p><p>Mr. J. F. Browne, Sir :—I have much pleasure in saying, that the Harp of your make I performed on at the St. George’s Society Concert,
<lb/>is, in brilliancy of tone, touch and elegance of workmanship, the finest I ever played on. This will apply to all your Harps. The Grand six
<lb/>and a half Gothic Double action, is a most splendid instrument.	Yours, with respect, ELIZABETH SLOMAN.</p><p>New York, January 16th, 1845.	A pupil of N. C. Bochsa.
</p><p>Mr. J. F. Browne, Sir :—Having at your request closely scrutinized your double-action Harps. I find they possess the best qualities of the
<lb/>first Makers in Europe combined. That the ease of touch, by which the most brilliant tone is obtained, the perfection and ease of modulation,
<lb/>they are superior to any I have used; their elegance of exterior must gratify the most refined taste. Your new Grand Gothic six and a half oc-
<lb break="no"/>tavo, is the most splendid effort of art yet produced in the musical world; it will give me great pleasure in recommending our Harps at every
<lb/>opportunity.	Yours Truly, HENRY HORN.</p><p>January 12th, 1854.	An eminent professor, and Member of the Royal Academy.
</p><p>These are but a very small part of the testimonials received, but will suffice to show the estimate of persons every way capable of making a
<lb/>correct decision. J. F. Browne has also received the Franklin Medal of the Society of Arts, Philadelphia, for his splendid improvements in
<lb/>this delightful Instrument.</p><p>Harps from 300 to 1000 dollars. Harps repaired, strings, &amp;c.
