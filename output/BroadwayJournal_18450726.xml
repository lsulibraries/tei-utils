The Literary Life of Thingum Bob, Esq.
LATE EDITOR OF THE “ GOOSETHERUMFOODLE.”
BY HIMSELF.
</p><p>I am now growing in years, and—since I understand that
<lb/>Shakespeare and Mr. Emmons are deceased—it is not im-
<lb break="no"/>possible that I may even die. It has occurred to me, there-
<lb break="no"/>fore, that I may as well retire from the field of Letters and
<lb/>repose upon my laurels. But I am ambitious of signalizing
<lb/>my abdication of the literary sceptre by some important be-
<lb break="no"/>quest to posterity; and, perhaps, I cannot do a better
<lb/>thing than just pen for it an account of my earlier career.
<lb/>My name, indeed, has been so long and so constantly before
<lb/>the public eye, that I am not only willing to admit the nat-
<lb break="no"/>uralness of the interest which it has every where excited, but
<lb/>ready to satisfy the extreme curiosity which it has inspired.
<lb/>In fact it is no more than the duty of him who achieves great-
<lb break="no"/>ness, to leave behind him, in his ascent, such landmarks as
<lb/>may guide others to be great. I propose, therefore, in the
<lb/>present paper, (which I had some idea of calling “ Memo-
<lb break="no"/>randa to serve for the Literary History of America,”) to give
<lb/>a detail of those important, yet feeble and tottering first steps,
<lb/>by which, at length, I attained the high road to the pinnacle
<lb/>of human renown.</p><p></p><p>Of one’s very remote ancestors it is superfluous to say
<lb/>much. My father, Thomas Bob, Esq., stood for many
<lb/>years at the summit of his profession, which was that of a
<lb/>merchant-barber, in the city of Smug. His warehouse was
<lb/>the resort of all the principal people of the place, and espe-
<lb break="no"/>cially of the editorial corps—a body which inspires all about
<lb/>it with profound veneration and awe. For my own part, I
<lb/>regarded them as Gods, and drank in with avidity the rich wit
<lb/>and wisdom which continuously flowed from their august
<lb/>mouths during the process of what is styled “ lather.” My
<lb/>first moment of positive inspiration must be dated from that
<lb/>ever-memorable epoch, when the brilliant conductor of the
<lb/>‘‘Gad-Fly,’’ in the intervals of the important process just
<lb/>mentioned, recited aloud, before a conclave of our apprentices,
<lb/>an inimitable poem in honor of the “ Only Genuine Oil-of-
<lb break="no"/>Bob,” (so called from its talented inventor, my father,) and
<lb/>for which effusion the editor of the “ Fly" was remunerated
<lb/>with a regal liberality, by the firm of Thomas Bob and com-
<lb break="no"/>pany, merchant barbers.</p><p></p><p>The genius of the stanzas to the “ Oil-of-Bob" first breath-
<lb break="no"/>ed into me, I say, the divine afflatus. I resolved at once to
<lb/>become a great man and to commence by becoming a great
<lb/>poet. That very evening I fell upon my knees at the feet
<lb/>of my father.</p><p></p><p>“ Father,” I said, “ pardon me!—but I have a soul above
<lb/>lather. It is my firm intention to cut the shop. I would
<lb/>be an editor—I would be a poet—I would pen stanzas to
<lb/>the ‘ Oil-of-Bob.’ Pardon me and aid me to be great!”</p><p>“ My dear Thingum,” replied my father, (I had been
christened Thingum after a wealthy relative so surnamed,)
</p><p>“ My dear Thingum,” he said, raising me from my knees by
<lb/>the ears—“ Thingum, my boy, you’re a trump, and take af-
<lb break="no"/>ter your father in having a soul. You have an immense
<lb/>head, too, and it must hold a great many brains. This
<lb/>I have long seen, and therefore had thoughts of making you
<lb/>a lawyer. The business, however, has grown ungenteel,
<lb/>and that of a politician don’t pay. Upon the whole you
<lb/>judge wisely;—the trade of editor is best:—and if you can
<lb/>be a poet at the same time,—as most of the editors are, by
<lb/>the by,—why you will kill two birds with one stone. To
<lb/>encourage you in the beginning of things, I will allow you a
<lb/>garret; pen, ink and paper ; a rhyming dictionary ; and a
<lb/>copy of the ‘ Gad-Fly.’ I suppose you would scarcely de-
<lb break="no"/>mand any more.”</p><p></p><p>“I would be an ungrateful villain if I did,” I replied with
<lb/>enthusiasm. “ Your generosity is boundless. I will repay
<lb/>it by making you the father of a genius.”</p><p></p><p>Thus ended my conference with the best of men, and im-
<lb break="no"/>mediately upon its termination, I betook myself with zeal to
<lb/>my poetical labors ; as upon these, chiefly, I founded my
<lb/>hopes of ultimate elevation to the editorial chair.</p><p></p><p>In my first attempts at composition I found the stanzas to
<lb/>“ The Oil-of-Bob” rather a draw-back than otherwise.
<lb/>Their splendor more dazzled than enlightened me. The
<lb/>contemplation of their excellence tended, naturally, to discour-
<lb break="no"/>age me by comparison with my own abortions; so that for
<lb/>a long time I labored in vain. At length there came into
<lb/>my head one of those exquisitely original ideas which now
<lb/>and then will permeate the brain of a man of genius. It
<lb/>was this:—or, rather, thus was it carried into execution.
<lb/>From the rubbish of an old book-stall, in a very remote cor-
<lb break="no"/>ner of the town, I got together several antique and altogeth-
<lb break="no"/>er unknown or forgotten volumes. The bookseller sold them
<lb/>to me for a song. From one of these, which purported to be
<lb/>a translation of one Dante's “Inferno,” I copied with re-
<lb break="no"/>markable neatness a long passage about a man named Ugo-
<lb break="no"/>lino, who had a parcel of brats. From another which con-
<lb break="no"/>tained a good many old plays by some person whose name
<lb/>I forget, I extracted in the same manner, and with the same
<lb/>care, a great number of lines about “ angels" and “ ministers
<lb/>saying grace,” and “goblins damned,” and more besides of
<lb/>that sort. From a third, which was the composition of some
<lb/>blind man or other, either a Greek or a Choctaw—I cannot
<lb/>be at the pains of remembering every trifle exactly—I took
<lb/>about fifty verses beginning with “ Achilles’ wrath,” and
<lb/>“ grease,” and something else. From a fourth, which I re-
<lb break="no"/>collect was also the work of a blind man, I selected a page
<lb/>or two all about “ hail” and “holy light;” and although a
<lb/>blind man has no business to write about light, still the verses
<lb/>were sufficiently good in their way.</p><p></p><p>Having made fair copies of these poems I signed everyone
<lb/>of them " Oppodeldoc,” (a fine sonorous name,) and, doing
<lb/>each up nicely in a separate envelope, I despatched one to
<lb/>each of the four principal Magazines, with a request for
<lb/>speedy insertion and prompt pay. The result of this well</p><p><pb n="34"/>
</p><p>conceived plan, however, (the success of which would have
<lb/>saved me much trouble in after life,) served to convince me
<lb/>that some editors are not to be bamboozled, and gave the
<lb/>coup-de-grace (as they say in France,) to my nascent hopes,
<lb/>(as they say in the city of the transcendentals.)</p><p></p><p>The fact is, that each and every one of the Magazines in
<lb/>question, gave Mr. “Oppodeldoc’ a complete using-up, in
<lb/>the “ Monthly Notices to Correspondents.” The “ Hum-
<lb break="no"/>Drum” gave him a dressing after this fashion:</p><p></p><p>“ ‘Oppodeldoc,’ (whoever he is,) has sent us a long tirade con-
<lb break="no"/>cerning a bedlamite whom he styles ‘ Ugolino,” who had a great 
<lb/>many children that should have been all whipped and sent to bed 
<lb/>without their suppers. The whole affair is exceedingly tame—not
<lb/>to say flat. ‘Oppodeldoc,’ (whoever he is,) is entirely devoid of
<lb/>imagination—and imagination, in our humble opinion, is not only
<lb/>the soul of Poesy, but also its very heart. Oppodeldoc,’ (whoever
<lb/>he is,) has the audacity to demand of us, for his twattle, a ‘ speedy
<lb/>insertion and prompt pay.’ We neither insert nor purchase any
<lb/>stuff of the sort. There can be no doubt, however, that he would
<lb/>meet with a ready sale for all the balderdash he can scribble, at the
<lb/>office of either the ‘ Rowdy-Dow,’ the ‘ Lollipop,’ or the ‘ Goose-
<lb break="no"/>therumfoodle.’ ”</p><p></p><p>All this, it must be acknowledged, was very severe upon
<lb/>“ Oppodeldoc”—but the unkindest cut was putting the word
<lb/>Poesy in small caps. In those five preeminent letters what
<lb/>a world of bitterness is there not involved !</p><p>But “ Oppodeldoc” was punished with equal severity in
the “ Rowdy-dow,” which spoke thus:
</p><p>“We have received a most singular and insolent communication
<lb/>from a person, (whoever he is,) signing himself ‘ Oppodeldoc’—
<lb/>thus desecrating the greatness of the illustrious Roman Emperor so
<lb/>named. Accompanying the letter of ‘ Oppodeldoc,’ (whoever he
<lb/>is,) we find sundry lines of most disgusting and unmeaning rant
<lb/>about ‘ angels and ministers of grace’—rant such as no madman
<lb/>short of a Nat Lee, or an ‘ Oppodeldoc,’ could possibly perpetrate.
<lb/>And for this trash of trash, we are modestly requested to ‘ pay
<lb/>promptly.’ No sir—no ! We pay for nothing of that sort. Apply
<lb/>to the ‘ Hum-Drum,’ the ‘ Lollipop,’ or the ‘ Goosetherumfoodle.’
<lb/>These periodicals will undoubtedly accept any literary offal you
<lb/>may send them—and as undoubtedly promise to pay for it.”</p><p></p><p>This was bitter indeed upon poor “ Oppodeldoc but, in
<lb/>this instance, the weight of the satire falls upon the “ Hum-
<lb break="no"/>drum,” the “ Lollipop,” and the “ Goosetherumfoodle,” who
<lb/>are pungently styled “ periodicals" — in Italics, too — a
<lb/>thing that must have cut them to the heart.</p><p>Scarcely less savage was the “Lollipop,” which thus
discoursed:
</p><p>“ Some individual, who rejoices in the appellation ‘ Oppodeldoc,’
<lb/>(to what low uses are the names of the illustrious dead too often
<lb/>applied!) has enclosed us some fifty or sixty verses, commencing
<lb/>after this fashion:</p><p>Achilles’ wrath, to Greece the direful spring
Of woes unnumbered, &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c.
</p><p>‘ Oppodeldoc,’ (whoever he is,) is respectfully informed that
<lb/>there is not a printer’s devil in our office who is not in the daily ha-
<lb break="no"/>bit of composing better lines. Those of ‘ Oppodeldoc’ will not scan.</p><p></p><p>' Oppodeldoc' should learn to count. But why he shouldehave con-
<lb break="no"/>ceived the idea that we, (of all others, we!) would disgrace our
<lb/>pages with his ineffable nonsense, is utterly beyond comprehension
<lb/>Why, the absurd twattle is scarcely good enough for the ‘ Hum-
<lb break="no"/>Drum,’ the ‘ Rowdy-Dow,’ the ‘ Goosetherumfoodle’—things that
<lb/>are in the practice of publishing ‘ Mother Goose’s Melodies’ as ori-
<lb break="no"/>nal lyrics. And ‘Oppodeldoc, (whoever he is,) has even the assu-
<lb break="no"/>rance to demand pay for this drivel. Does 'Oppodeldoc,' (who-
<lb break="no"/>ever he is,) know—is he aware that we could not be paid to insert
<lb/>it?”</p><p>As I perused this I felt myself growing gradually smaller
</p><p>and smaller, and when I came to the point at which the edi-
<lb break="no"/>tor sneered at the poem as “ verses," there was little more
<lb/>than an ounce of me left. As for “ Oppodeldoc” I began to
<lb/>experience compassion for the poor fellow. But the “ Goose-
<lb break="no"/>therumfoodle” showed, if possible, less mercy than the “ Lol-
<lb break="no"/>lipop.” It was the “ Goosetherumfoodle” that said :</p><p></p><p>“ A wretched poetaster, who signs himself ‘ Oppodeldoc,’ is silly
<lb/>enough to fancy that we will print and pay for a medley of incohe-
<lb break="no"/>rent and ungrammatical bombast which he has transmitted to us,
<lb/>and which commences with the following most intelligible line:</p><p>“ Hail, Holy Light! Offspring of Heaven, first born.”
</p><p>“ We say, ‘ most intelligible.’ ‘Oppodeldoc,’ (whoever he is,)
<lb/>will be kind enough to tell us, perhaps, how ‘hail' can be ‘ holy
<lb/>light.’ We always regarded it as frozen rain. Will he inform us,
<lb/>also, how frozen rain can be, at one and the same time, both ‘ holy
<lb/>light,’ (whatever that is,) and an ‘ offspring?'—which latter term, (if
<lb/>we understand any thing about English,) is only employed, with
<lb/>propriety, in reference to small babies of about six weeks old. But
<lb/>it is preposterous to descant upon such absurdity—although ‘ Oppo-
<lb break="no"/>deldoc,’ (whoever he is,) has the unaparalleled effrontery to sup-
<lb break="no"/>pose that we will not only ‘ insert’ his ignorant ravings, but (abso-
<lb break="no"/>lutely) pay for them !</p><p></p><p>“ Now this is fine—it is rich!—and we have half a mind to
<lb/>punish 'his young scribbler for his egotism, by really publishing his
<lb/>ffusion, verbatim et literatim, as he has written it. We could in-
<lb break="no"/>flict no punishment so severe, and we would inflict it, but for the
<lb/>boredom which we should cause our readers in so doing.</p><p></p><p>“ Let ‘ Oppodeldoc,’ (whoever he is.) send any future composition
<lb/>of like character to the ' Hum-Drum,’ the ‘Lollipop,’ or the ‘ Row-
<lb break="no"/>dy-Dow.’ They will ‘insert' it. They ‘insert’ every month just
<lb/>such stuff. Send it to them. WE are not to be insulted with im-
<lb break="no"/>punity.”</p><p></p><p>This made an end of me ; and as for the “ Hum-Drum,’>
<lb/>the “Rowdy-Dow,” and the “Lollipop,” I never could com-
<lb break="no"/>prehend how they survived it. The putting them in the
<lb/>smallest possible minion, (that was the rub—thereby insinu-
<lb break="no"/>ating their lowness—their baseness,) while WE stood look-
<lb break="no"/>ing down upon them in gigantic capitals!—oh it was too bit-
<lb break="no"/>ter !—it was wormwood—it was gall. Had I been either of
<lb/>these periodicals I would have spared no pains to have the
<lb/>“ Goosetherumfoodle” prosecuted. It might have been done
<lb/>under the Act for the “Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.”
<lb/>As for “ Oppodeldoc,” (whoever he was,) I had by this time
<lb/>lost all patience with the fellow, and sympathized with him
<lb/>no longer. He was a fool, beyond doubt, (whoever he was,)
<lb/>and got not a kick more than he deserved.</p><p></p><p>The result of my experiment with the old books, convinc-
<lb break="no"/>ed me, in the first place, that “honesty is the best policy,”
<lb/>and, in the second, that if I could not write better than Mr.
<lb/>Dante, and the two blind men, and the rest of the old set, it
<lb/>would, at least, be a difficult matter to write worse. I took
<lb/>heart, therefore, and determined to prosecute the “ entirely
<lb/>original," (as they say on the covers of the magazines,) at
<lb/>whatever cost of study and pains. I again placed before my
<lb/>eyes, as a model, the brilliant stanzas on “ The Oil-of-Bob,”
<lb/>by the editor of the “ Gad-Fly,” and resolved to construct an
<lb/>Ode on the same sublime theme, in rivalry of what had al-
<lb break="no"/>ready been done.</p><p>With my first verse I had no material difficulty. It ran
thus:
To pen an Ode upon the “ Oil-of-Bob.”
</p><p>Having carefully looked out, however, all the legitimate
<lb/>rhymes to “ Bob,” I found it impossible to proceed. In this
<lb/>dilemma I had recourse to paternal aid ; and, after some hours
<lb/>of mature thought, my father and myself thus constructed
<lb/>the poem:</p><p><pb n="35"/>
To pen an Ode upon the 
"Oil-of-Bob”
Is all sorts of a job.
(Signed,)	Snob.
</p><p>To be sure this composition was of no very great length—
<lb/>but I “ have yet to learn” as they say in the Edinburgh Re
<lb/>view, that the mere extent of a literacy work has any thing
<lb/>to do with its merit. As for the Quarterly cant about
<lb/>“ sustained effort,” it is impossible to see the sense of it.
<lb/>Upon the whole, therefore, I was satisfied with the success
<lb/>of my maiden attempt, and now the only question regarded
<lb/>the disposal I should make of it. My father suggested that I
<lb/>should send it to the “ Gad-Fly”—but there were two rea-
<lb break="no"/>sons which operated to prevent me from so doing. I dreaded
<lb/>the jealousy of the editor—and I had ascertained that he did
<lb/>not pay for original contributions. I therefore, after due
<lb/>deliberation, consigned the article to the more dignified
<lb/>pages of the “ Lollipop,” and awaited the event in anxiety,
<lb/>but with resignation.</p><p></p><p>In the very next published number I had the proud satis-
<lb break="no"/>faction of seeing my poem printed at length, as the leading
<lb/>article, with the following significant words, prefixed in ita-
<lb break="no"/>lics and between brackets :</p><p></p><p>[" We cali the attention of our readers to the subjoined admirable
<lb/>stanzas on “ The Oil-of-Bob." We need say nothing of their subli-
<lb break="no"/>mity, or of their pathos:—it is impossible to peruse them without
<lb/>tears. Those who have been nauseated with a sad dose on the same
<lb/>august topic from the goose-quill of the editor of the “ Gad-Fly,"
<lb/>will do well to compare the two compositions.</p><p></p><p>P. S. We are consumed with anxiety to probe the mystery which
<lb/>envelops the evident pseudonym “ Snob." May we not hope for a
<lb/>personal interview ?"]</p><p></p><p>All this was scarcely more than justice, but it was, I con-
<lb break="no"/>fess, rather more than I had expected :—I acknowledge this,
<lb/>be it observed, to the everlasting disgrace of my country and
<lb/>of mankind. I lost no time, however, in calling upon the
<lb/>editor of the “ Lollipop,” and had the good fortune to find
<lb/>this gentleman at home. He saluted me with an air of pro-
<lb break="no"/>found respect, slightly blended with a fatherly and patroniz-
<lb break="no"/>ing admiration, wrought in him, no doubt, by my appearance
<lb/>of extreme youth and inexperience. Begging me to be seat-
<lb break="no"/>ed, he entered at once upon the subject of my poem ;—but
<lb/>modesty will ever forbid me to repeat the thousand compli-
<lb break="no"/>ments which he lavished upon me. The eulogies of Mr.
<lb/>Crab, (such was the editor’s name,) were, however, by no
<lb/>means fulsomely indiscriminate. He analyzed my composi-
<lb break="no"/>tion with much freedom and great ability—not hesitating to
<lb/>point out a few trivial defects—a circumstance which ele-
<lb break="no"/>vated him highly in my esteem. The “ Gad-Fly” was, of
<lb/>course, brought upon the tapis, and I hope never to be sub-
<lb break="no"/>jected to a criticism so searching, or to rebukes so withering,
<lb/>as were bestowed by Mr. Crab upon that unhappy effusion.</p><p></p><p>I had been accustomed to regard the editor of the “ Gad-Fly”
<lb/>as something superhuman; but Mr. Crab soon disabused me
<lb/>of that idea. He set the literary as well as the personal cha-
<lb break="no"/>racter of the Fly (so Mr. C. satirically designated the rival
<lb/>editor,) in its true light. He, the Fly, was very little better
<lb/>than he should be. He had written infamous things. He
<lb/>was a penny-a-liner, and a buffoon. He was a villain.
<lb/>He had composed a tragedy which set the whole country in
<lb/>a guffaw, and a farce which deluged the universe in tears.
<lb/>Besides all this, he had the impudence to pen what he meant
<lb/>for a lampoon upon himself, (Mr. Crab,) and the temerity to
<lb/>style him “ an ass.” Should I at any time wish to express
<lb/>my opinion of Mr. Fry, the pages of the “Lollipop,” Mr.
<lb/>Crab assured me, were at my unlimited disposal. In the
<lb/>meantime, as it was very certain that I would be attacked in
<lb/>the Fly for my attempt at composing a rival poem o</p><p></p><p>Oil-of-Bob,” he (Mr. Crab,) would take it upon himself to
<lb/>attend, pointedly, to my private and personal interests. If I
<lb/>were not made a man of at once, it should not be the fault
<lb/>of himself, (Mr. Crab.)</p><p>Mr. Crab having now paused in his discourse, (the latter
	portion of which I found it impossible to comprehend,) I ven-
tured to suggest something about the remuneration which
</p><p>I had been taught to expect for my poem, by an announce-
<lb break="no"/>ment on the cover of the “ Lollipop,” declaring that it, (the
<lb/>j“ Lollipop,”) “ insisted upon being permitted to pay exorbi-
<lb break="no"/>tant prices for all accepted contributions;—frequently expend-
<lb break="no"/>ing more money for a single brief poem than the whole an-
<lb break="no"/>nual cost of the ‘ Hum-Drum,’ the ‘ Rowdy-Dow,’ and the
<lb/>' Goosetherumfoodle’ combined.”</p><p></p><p>As I mentioned the word “ remuneration,” Mr. Crab first
<lb/>opened his eyes, and then his mouth, to quite a remarkable
<lb/>extent: causing his personal appearance to resemble that of
<lb/>a highly-agitated elderly duck in the act of quacking;—and
<lb/>in this condition he remained, (ever and anon pressing his
<lb/> hands tightly to his forehead, as if in a state of desperate be-
<lb break="no"/>wilderment) until I had nearly made an end of what I had
<lb/>to say.</p><p></p><p>Upon my conclusion, he sank back into his seat, as if
<lb/>much overcome, letting his arms fall lifelessly by his side,
<lb/>but keeping his mouth still rigorously open, after the fashion
<lb/>of the duck. While I remained in speechless astonishment
<lb/>at behaviour so alarming, he suddenly leaped to his feet and
<lb/>made a rush at the bell-rope ; but just as he reached this, he
<lb/>appeared to have altered his intention, whatever it was, for
<lb/>he dived under a table and immediately re-appeared with a
<lb/>cudgel. This he was in the act of uplifting, (for what pur-
<lb break="no"/>pose I am at a loss to imagine,) when, all at once, there came
<lb/>a benign smile over his features, and he sank placidly back
<lb/> in his chair.</p><p>“ Mr. Bob,” he said, (for I had sent up my card before as-
cending myself,) “ Mr. Bob, you are a young man, I presume
 —very ?”
I assented; adding that I had not yet concluded my third
lustrum.
</p><p>“Ah!” he replied, “very good! I see how it is—say no
<lb/>more ! Touching this matter of compensation, what you ob-
<lb break="no"/> serve is very just: in fact it is excessively so. But—ah—ah
<lb/> —the first contribution—the first, I say—it is never the Ma-
<lb break="no"/> gazine custom to pay for—you comprehend, eh ? The truth
<lb/>is, we are usually the recipients in such case.” [Mr. Crab
<lb/>smiled blandly as he emphasized the word “ recipients.”]
<lb/>“ For the most part, we are paid for the insertion of a maiden
<lb/>attempt—especially in verse. In the second place, Mr. Bob,
<lb/>the Magazine rule is never to disburse what we term in
<lb/>France the argent comptant :—I have no doubt you under-
<lb break="no"/>stand. In a quarter or two after publication of the article—
<lb/>or in a year or two—we make no objection to giving our note
<lb/>at nine months :—provided always that we can so arrange
<lb/>our affairs as to be quite certain of a ‘ burst up’ in six. I
<lb/>really do hope, Mr. Bob, that you will look upon this expla-
<lb break="no"/>nation as satisfactory.” Here Mr. Crab concluded, and the
<lb/>tears stood in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Grieved to the soul at having been, however innocently,
<lb/>the cause of pain to so eminent and so sensitive a man, I
<lb/>hastened to apologize, and to reassure him, by expressing my
<lb/>perfect coincidence with his views, as well as my entire ap-
<lb break="no"/>preciation of the delicacy of his position. Having done all
<lb/>this in a neat speech, I took leave.</p><p></p><p>One fine morning, very shortly afterwards, “ I awoke and
<lb/>found myself famous.” The extent of my renown will e
<lb/>best estimated by reference to the editorial opinions of the</p><p><pb n="36"/>
</p><p>day. These opinions, it will be seen, were embodied in cri-
<lb break="no"/>tical notices of the number of the “ Lollipop-’ containing my
<lb/>poem, and are perfectly satisfactory, conclusive and clear
<lb/>with the exception, perhaps, of the hieroglyphical marks
<lb/>“ Sep. 15—1 t."	appended to each of the critiques.</p><p></p><p>The “Owl,” a journal of profound sagacity, and well
<lb/>known for the deliberate gravity of its literary decisions—the
<lb/>“ Owl,"’ I say, spoke as follows:</p><p></p><p>“ ‘ The Lollipop !’ The October number of this delicious Maga-
<lb break="no"/>zine surpasses its predecessors, and sets competition at defiance.
<lb/>In the beauty of its typography and paper—in the number and ex-
<lb break="no"/>cellence of its steel plates—as well as in the literary merit of its con-
<lb break="no"/>tributions—the 'Lollipop’ compares with its slow-paced rivals as
<lb/>Hyperion with a Satyr. The ‘ Hum-Drum.’ the ' Row.ly-Dow,’ and
<lb/>the ’ Goosetherumfoodle,’ excel, it is true, in braggadocio, but, in
<lb/>all other points, give us the ‘ Lollipop !' How this celebrated jour
<lb/>nal can sustain its evidently tremendous expenses, is more than we
<lb/>can understand. To be sure, it has a circulation of 100,000, and
<lb/>its subscription-list has increased one fourth during the last month:
<lb/>but, on the other hand, the sums it disburses constantly for contri-
<lb break="no"/>butions are inconceivable. It is reported that Mr. Slyass received
<lb/>no less than thirty-seven and a half cents for his inimitable paper on
<lb/>‘ Pigs.’ With Mr. Crab, as editor, and with such names upon the
<lb/>list of contributors as Snob and Slyass, there can be no such word as
<lb/>‘ fail’ for the ‘ Lollipop.’ Go and subscribe. Sep. 15—1t."</p><p></p><p>I must say that I was gratified with this high-toned notice
<lb/>from a paper so respectable as the “ Owl.” The placing my
<lb/>name—that is to say my nom de guerre—in priority of station
<lb/>to that of the great Slyass, was a compliment as happy as I
<lb/>felt it to be deserved.</p><p></p><p>My attention was next arrested by these paragraphs in
<lb/>the “ Toad”—a print highly distinguished for its upright-
<lb break="no"/>ness, and independence—for its entire freedom from sycophan-
<lb break="no"/>cy and subservience to the givers of dinners.</p><p></p><p>“ The ‘ Lollipop’ for October is out in advance of all its contem-
<lb break="no"/>poraries, and infinitely surpasses them, of course, in the splendor of
<lb/>its embellishments, as well as in the richness of its literary contents,
<lb/>The ‘ Hum-Drum,’ the ‘ Rowdy-Dow,’ and the ‘ Goosetherum-
<lb break="no"/>foodle’ excel, we admit, in braggadocio, but, in all other points,
<lb/>give us the ‘Lollipop" How this celebrated Magazine can sustain
<lb/>its evidently tremendous expenses, is more than we can understand.
<lb/>To be sure, it has a circulation of 200,000, and its subscription list
<lb/>has increased one third during the last fortnight, but on the other
<lb/>hand, the sums it disburses, monthly, for contributions, are fearfully
<lb/>great. We learn that Mr. Mumblelhumb received no less than fifty
<lb/>cents for his late ‘ Monody in a Mud-Puddle.’</p><p></p><p>“ Among the original contributors to the present number we no-
<lb break="no"/>tice, (besides the eminent editor, Mr. Crab.) such men as Snob,
<lb/>Slyass, and Mumblethumb. Apart from the editorial matter, the
<lb/>most valuable paper, nevertheless, is, we think, a poetical gem by
<lb/>‘ Snob,’ on the ‘ Oil-of-Bob’—but our readers must not suppose,
<lb/>from the title of this incomparable bijou, that it bears any similitude
<lb/>to some balderdash on the same subject by a certain contemptible
<lb/>individual whose name is unmentionable to ears polite. The pre-
<lb break="no"/>sent poem ‘ On the Oil-of-Bob,’ has excited universal anxiety and
<lb/>curiosity in respect to the owner of the evident pseudonym, ‘ Snob'
<lb/>—a curiosity which, happily, we have it in our power to satisfy.
<lb/>' Snob’ is the nom-de-plume of Mr. Thingum Bob, of this city,—a
<lb/>relative of the great Mr. Thingum, (after whom he is named,) and
<lb/>otherwise connected with the most illustrious families of the State.
<lb/>His father, Thomas Bob, Esq., is an opulent merchant in Smug.
<lb/>Sep. 15—1 t.”</p><p></p><p>This generous approbation touched me to the heart —the
<lb/>more especially as it emanated from a source so avowedly—
<lb/>so proverbially pure as the “ Toad.” The word “ balder-
<lb break="no"/>dash,” as applied to the “ Oil-of-Bob” of the Fly, I considered
<lb/>singularly pungent and appropriate. The words “ gem” and
<lb/>"bijou," however, used in reference to my composition,</p><p></p><p> struck me as being, in some degree, feeble. They seemed
<lb/> to me to be deficient in force. They were not sufficiently
<lb/>prononces, (as we have it in France.)</p><p></p><p> I had hardly finished reading the “ Toad,” when a friend
<lb/>placed in my hands a copy of the “ Mole,” a daily, enjoying
<lb/>high reputation for the keenness of its perception about mat-
<lb break="no"/>ters in general, and for the open, honest, above-ground style
<lb/>of its editorials. The “ Mole” spoke of the “ Lollipop” as
<lb/>follows :</p><p></p><p>“ We have just received the ‘ Lollipop’ for October, and must say
<lb/>that never before have we perused any single number of any perio-
<lb break="no"/>dical which afforded us a felicity so supreme. We speak advisedly.
<lb/>The ‘Hum-Drum,’ the ‘ Rowdy-Dow’ and the ‘ Goosetherumfoodle’
<lb/>must look well to their laurels. These prints, no doubt, surpass
<lb/>every thing in loudness of pretension, but, in all other points, give
<lb/>us the ‘ Lollipop !’ How this celebrated Magazine can sustain its
<lb/>evidently tremendous expenses, is more than we can comprehend.
<lb/>To be sure, it hits a circulation of 300,000 ; and its subscription-list
<lb/>has increased one half within the last week, but then the sum it dis-
<lb break="no"/>burses, monthly, for contributions, is astoundingly enormous. We
<lb/>have it upon good authority, that Mr. Fatquack received no less
<lb/>than sixty-two cents and a half for his late Domestic Nouvelette, the
<lb/> ‘ Dish-Clout.’</p><p></p><p>“ The contributors to the number before us are Mr. Crab, (the
<lb/> eminent editor,) Snob, Mumblelhumb, Fatquack and others; but,
<lb/>after the inimitable compositions of the editor himself, we prefer a
<lb/> diamond-like effusion from the pen of a rising poet who writes
<lb/>over the signature ‘ Snob’—a nom de guerre which we predict will
<lb/>one day extinguish the radiance of ‘ Boz.’ ‘ Snob,’ we learn, is a
<lb/> Mr. Thingum Bob, sole heir of a wealthy merchant of this city,
<lb/> Thomas Bob. Esq., and a near relative of the distinguished Mr.</p><p></p><p> Thingum. The title of Mr. B.’s admirable poem is the ' Oil-of-Bob’
<lb/>—a somewhat unfortunate name, by-the-bye, as some contemptible
<lb/>vagabond connected with the penny press has already disgusted the
<lb/> town with a great deal of drivel upon the same topic. There will
<lb/>be no danger, however, of confounding the compositions. Sep. 15
<lb/>—1 t."</p><p></p><p>The generous approbation of so clear-sighted a journal as
<lb/>the “ Mole" penetrated my soul with delight. The only ob-
<lb break="no"/>jection which occurred to me was, that the terms “con-
<lb break="no"/>temptible vagabond-’ might have been better written “odious
<lb/>and contemptible, wretch, villain and vagabond.” This would
<lb/> have sounded more gracefully, I think. “Diamond-like,”
<lb/>also, was scarcely, it will be admitted, of sufficient intensity
<lb/> to express what the “Mole" evidently thought of the brilliancy
<lb/> of the “ Oil-of-Bob.”</p><p></p><p>On the same afternoon in which I saw these notices in the
<lb/>“Owl,” the “Toad,” and the “Mole,” I happened to meet
<lb/>with a copy of the “ Daddy-Long-Legs,” a periodical prover-
<lb break="no"/>bial for the extreme extent of its understanding. And it was
<lb/>the -‘Daddy-Long Legs" which spoke thus:</p><p></p><p>“ The ‘ Lollipop’!! This gorgeous Magazine is already before
<lb/>the public for October. The question of pre-eminence is forever
<lb/> put to rest, and hereafter it will be excessively preposterous in the
<lb/>‘ Hum-Drum,’ the ‘ Rowdy-Dow,’ or the ‘ Goosetherumfoodle,’ to
<lb/> make any farther spasmodic attempts at competition. These jour-
<lb break="no"/>nals may excel the ‘ Lollipop’ in outcry, but, in all other points, give
<lb/>us the ‘ Lollipop!’ How this celebrated Magazine can sustain its
<lb/> evidently tremendous expenses, is past comprehension. To be sure
<lb/> it has a circulation of precisely half a million, and its subscription-list
<lb/> has increased seventy-five per cent, within the last couple of days ;
<lb/> but then the sums it disburses, monthly, for contributions, are
<lb/>scarcely credible ; we are cognizant of the fact, that Mademoiselle
<lb/>Cribalittle received no lets than eighty-seven cents and a half for
<lb/> her late valuable Revolutionary Tale, entitled ‘ The York-Town
<lb/>Katy-Did, and the Bunker-Hill Katy-Did’nt.’</p><p>“ The most able papers in the present number, are, of course,
 those furnished by the editor, (the eminent Mr. CRAB.) but there
<pb n="37"/>
</p><p>are numerous magnificent contributions from such names as Snob;
<lb/>Mademoiselle Cribalittle ; Slyass; Mrs. Fibalittle; Mumblethumb;
<lb/>Mrs. Squibalittle; and. last, though not least, Fatquack. The world
<lb/>may well be challenged to produce so rich a galaxy of genius.</p><p></p><p>“ The poem over the signature ‘ Snob’ is, we find, attracting uni-
<lb break="no"/>versal commendation, and, we are constrained to say, deserves, if
<lb/>possible, even more applause than it has received. The ‘ Oil-of-
<lb break="no"/>Bob' is the title of this masterpiece of eloquence and art. One or
<lb/>two of our readers may have a very faint, although sufficiently dis-
<lb break="no"/>gusting recollection of a poem (?) similarly entitled, the perpetra_
<lb/>tion of a miserable penny-a-liner, mendicant, and cut-throat, connect-
<lb break="no"/>ed in the capacity of scullion, we believe, with one of the indecent
<lb/>prints about the purlieus of the city ; we beg them, for God’s sake,
<lb/>not to confound the compositions. The author of the ‘ Oil-of.Bob,
<lb/>is, we hear, Thingum Bob, Fsq.. a gentleman of high genius, and
<lb/>a scholar. ‘ Snob’ is merely a nom-de-guerre. Sept. 15—1 t.”</p><p></p><p>I could scarcely restrain my indignation while I perused
<lb/>the concluding portions of this diatribe. It was clear to me
<lb/>that the yea-nay manner—not to say the gentleness—the
<lb/>positive forbearance with which the “Daddy-Long-Legs”
<lb/>spoke of that pig, the editor of the “Gad-Fly”—it was evi-
<lb break="no"/>dent to me, I say, that this gentleness of speech could pro-
<lb break="no"/>ceed from nothing else than a partiality for the Fly—whom
<lb/>it was clearly the intention of the “ Daddy-Long-Legs” to
<lb/>elevate into reputation at my expense. Any one, indeed,
<lb/>might perceive, with half an eye, that, had the real design of
<lb/>the “Daddy” been what it wished to appear, it, (the “Dad-
<lb break="no"/>dy,”) might have expressed itself in terms more direct, more
<lb/>pungent, and altogether more to the purpose. The words
<lb/>“ penny-a-liner,” “mendicant,” “scullion,” and “cut-throat,”
<lb/>were epithets so intentionally inexpressive and equivocal, as
<lb/>to be worse than nothing when applied to the author of the
<lb/>very worst stanzas ever penned by one of the human race.
<lb/>We all know what is meant by “ damning with faint praise,"
<lb/>and, on the other hand, who could fail seeing through the
<lb/>covert purpose of the “ Daddy”—that of glorifying with
<lb/>feeble abuse ?</p><p></p><p>What the “ Daddy” chose to say of the Fly, however, was
<lb/>no business of mine. What it said of myself was. After the
<lb/>noble manner in which the “Owl,” the “Toad,” the
<lb/>“ Mole,” had expressed themselves in respect to my ability,
<lb/>it was rather too much to be cooly spoken of by a thing like
<lb/>the “ Daddy-Long-Legs,” as merely “a gentleman of high
<lb/>genius and a scholar.” Gentleman indeed ! I made up my
<lb/>mind, at once, either to get a written apology from the
<lb/>“ Daddy-Long-Legs,” or to call it out.</p><p></p><p>Full of this purpose, I looked about me to find a friend
<lb/>whom I could entrust with a message to his Daddyship, and,
<lb/>as the editor of the “ Lollipop” had given me marked tokens
<lb/>of regard, I at length concluded to seek assistance upon the
<lb/>present occasion.</p><p></p><p>I have never yet been able to account, in a manner satis-
<lb break="no"/>factory to my own understanding, for the very peculiar coun-
<lb break="no"/>tenance and demeanor with which Mr. Crab listened to me,
<lb/>as I unfolded to him my design. He again went through
<lb/>the scene of the bell-rope and cudgel, and did not omit the
<lb/>duck. At one period I thought he really intended to quack.
<lb/>His fit, nevertheless, finally subsided as before, and he began
<lb/>to act and speak in a rational way. He declined bearing the
<lb/>cartel, however, and in fact, dissuaded me from sending it at
<lb/>all; but was candid enough to admit that the “ Daddy- 
<lb/>Long-Legs” had been disgracefully in the wrong—more es-
<lb break="no"/>pecially in what related to the epithets “gentleman and
<lb/>scholar."</p><p></p><p>Towards the end of this interview with Mr. Crab, who
<lb/>really appeared to take a paternal interest in my welfare,
<lb/>he suggested to me that I might turn an honest penny and,</p><p>at the same time, advance my reputation, by occasionally
playing Thomas Hawk for the “Lollipop.”
I begged Mr. Crab to inform me who was Mr. Thomas
Hawk, and how it was expected that I should play him.
</p><p>Here Mr. Crab again “ made great eyes,” (as we say in
<lb/>Germany,) but at length, recovering himself from a profound
<lb/>attack of astonishment, he assured me that he employed the
<lb/>words “ Thomas Hawk” to avoid the colloquialism, Tommy,
<lb/>which was low—but that the true idea was Tommy Hawk
<lb/> —or tomahawk—and that by “ playing tomahawk” he re-
<lb break="no"/> ferred to scalping, brow-beating and otherwise using-up the
<lb/>herd of poor-devil authors.</p><p></p><p>I assured my patron that, if this was all, I was perfectly
<lb/> resigned to the task of playing Thomas Hawk. Hereupon
<lb/>Mr. Crab desired me to use-up the editor of the “ Gad-Fly”
<lb/>forthwith, in the fiercest style within the scope of my ability,
<lb/>and as a specimen of my powers. This I did, upon the spot,
<lb/>in a review of the original “Oil-of-Bob,” occupying thirty-
<lb break="no"/>six pages of the “Lollipop.” I found playing Thomas
<lb/>Hawk, indeed, a far less onerous occupation than poetizing;
<lb/>for I went upon system altogether, and thus it was easy to
<lb/>do the thing thoroughly and well. My practice was this.</p><p></p><p>I bought auction copies (cheap) of “ Lord Brougham’s
<lb/>Speeches," “ Cobbett’s Complete Works,” the “ New Slang-
<lb break="no"/>Syllabus,” the “ Whole Art of Snubbing,” “ Prentice’s Bill-
<lb break="no"/>ingsgate,” (folio edition,) and “ Lewis G. Clarke on Tongue.”
<lb/>These works I cut up thoroughly with a curry-comb, and
<lb/>then, throwing the shreds into a sieve, sifted out carefully
<lb/>all that might be thought decent, (a mere trifle); reserving
<lb/>the hard phrases, which I threw into a large tin pepper-cas-
<lb break="no"/>tor with longitudinal holes, so that an entire sentence could
<lb/>get through without material injury. The mixture was then
<lb/>ready for use. When called upon to play Thomas Hawk, I
<lb/>anointed a sheet of fools-cap with the while of a gander's
<lb/>egg; then, shredding the thing to be reviewed as I had pre-
<lb break="no"/>viously shredded the books,—only with more care, so as to
<lb/>get every word separate—I threw the latter shreds in with
<lb/>the former, screwed on the lid of the castor, gave it a shake,
<lb/>and so dusted out the mixture upon the egg’d foolscap;
<lb/>where it stuck. The effect was beautiful to behold. It was
<lb/>captivating. Indeed the reviews I brought to pass by this
<lb/>simple expedient have never been approached, and were the
<lb/>wonder of the world. At first, through bashfulness—the re-
<lb break="no"/>sult of inexperience—I was a little put out by a certain in-
<lb break="no"/>consistency—a certain air of the bizarre, (as we say in
<lb/>France,) worn by the composition as a whole. All the
<lb/>phrases did not fit, (as we say in the Anglo-Saxon.) Many
<lb/>were quite awry. Some, even, were up-side-down ; and
<lb/>there were none of them which were not, in some measure,
<lb/>injured, in regard to effect, by this latter species of accident,
<lb/>when it occurred :—with the exception of Mr. Lewis Clarke’s
<lb/>paragraphs, which were so vigorous, and altogether stout,
<lb/>that they seemed not particularly disconcerted by any ex-
<lb break="no"/>treme of position, but looked equally happy and satisfactory,
<lb/>whether on their heads, or on their heels.</p><p></p><p>What became of the editor of the “Gad-Fly,” after the
<lb/>publication of my criticism on his “ Oil-of-Bob," it is some-
<lb break="no"/>what difficult to determine. The most reasonable conclu-
<lb break="no"/>sion is, that he wept himself to death. At all events he dis-
<lb break="no"/>appeared instantaneously from the face of the earth, and no
<lb/>man has seen even the ghost of him since.</p><p></p><p>This matter having been properly accomplished, and
<lb/>the Furies appeased, I grew at once into high favor with
<lb/>Mr. Crab. He took me into his confidence, gave me a per-
<lb break="no"/>manent situation as Thomas Hawk of the “ Lollipop,” and
<lb/>as, for the present, he could afford me no salary, allowed me</p><p><pb n="38"/>
to profit, at discretion, by his advice.
</p><p>“ My Dear Thingum,” said he to me one day after dinner,
<lb/>“I respect your abilities and love you as a son. You shall
<lb/>be my heir. When I die I will bequeath you the ‘ Lollipop.’
<lb/>In the meantime I will make a man of you—I will— provid-
<lb break="no"/>ed always that you follow my counsel. The first thing to
<lb/>do is to get rid of the old bore.”</p><p>“ Boar ?” said I inquiringly—“pig, eh?—aper ? (as we
say in Latin)—who ?—where ?
“ Your father,” said he.
“Precisely,” I replied,—“pig.”
</p><p>“ You have your fortune to make, Thingum,” resumed
<lb/>Mr. Crab. “ and that governor of yours is a millstone about
<lb/>your neck. We must cut him at once.” [Here I took out
<lb/>my knife.] “ We must cut him,” continued Mr. Crab, “ de-
<lb break="no"/>cidedly and forever. He won’t do—he won't. Upon sec-
<lb break="no"/>cond thoughts, you had better kick him, or cane him, or
<lb/>something of that kind.”</p><p></p><p>What do you say,” I suggested modestly, “to my kicking
<lb/>him in the first instance, caning him afterwards, and wind-
<lb break="no"/>ing up by tweaking his nose?”</p><p>Mr. Crab looked at me musingly for some moments, and
then answered:
</p><p>“ I think, Mr. Bob, that what you propose would answer
<lb/>sufficiently well—indeed remarkably well—that is to say, as
<lb/>far as it went—but barbers are exceedingly hard to cut, and
<lb/>I think, upon the whole, that, having performed upon Thom-
<lb break="no"/>as Bob the operations you suggest, it would be advisable to
<lb/>blacken, with your fists, both his eyes, very carefully and
<lb/>thoroughly, to prevent his ever seeing you again in fashion-
<lb break="no"/>able promenades. After doing this, I really do not perceive
<lb/>that you can do any more. However—it might be just as
<lb/>well to roll him once or twice in the gutter, and then put
<lb/>him in charge of the police. Any time the next morning
<lb/>you can call at the watch-house and swear an assault.</p><p></p><p>I was much affected by the kindness of feeling towards
<lb/>me personally, which was evinced in this excellent advice
<lb/>of Mr. Crab, and I did not fail to profit by it forthwith.
<lb/>The result was, that I got rid of the old bore, and began to
<lb/>feel a little independent and gentleman-like. The want of
<lb/>money, however, was, for a few weeks, a source of some
<lb/>discomfort; but at length, by carefully putting to use my
<lb/>two eyes, and observing how matters went just in front of
<lb/>my nose, I perceived how the thing was to be brought about.
<lb/>I say “ thing”—be it observed—for they tell me the Latin
<lb/>for it is rem. By the way, talking of Latin, can any one tell
<lb/>me the meaning of quocunque—or what is the meaning of
<lb/>modo ?</p><p></p><p>My plan was exceedingly simple. I bought, for a song, a
<lb/>sixteenth of the “ Snapping-Turtle:”—that was all. The
<lb/>thing was done, and I put money in my purse. There were
<lb/>some trivial arrangements afterwards, to be sure; but these
<lb/>formed no portion of the plan. They were a consequence—a
<lb/>result. For example, I bought pen, ink and paper, and put
<lb/>them into furious activity. Having thus completed a Maga-
<lb break="no"/>zine article, I gave it, for appellation, “Fol-Lol, by the Author
<lb/>of 'The Oil-of-Bob,’” and enveloped it to the “Goosether-
<lb break="no"/>umfoodle.” That journal, however, having pronounced it
<lb/>“twattle” in the “Monthly Notices to Correspondents,” I
<lb/>reheaded the paper “ ‘ Hey-Diddle-Diddle’ by Thingum Bob,
<lb/>Esq., Author of the Ode on ' The Oil-of-Bob,’ and Editor of
<lb/>the ‘ Snapping-Turtle.’ ” With this amendment, I reenclos-
<lb break="no"/>ed it to the “ Goosetherumfoodle,” and, while I awaited a
<lb/>reply, published daily, in the “ Turtle," six columns of what
<lb/>may be termed philosophical and analytical investigation of
<lb/>the literary merits of the “ Goosetherumfoodle,” as well as </p><p></p><p>of the personal character of the editor of the “ Goosetherum-
<lb break="no"/>foodle.” At the end of a week the “ Goosetherunifoodle”
<lb/>discovered that it had, by some odd mistake, “ confounded a
<lb/>stupid article, headed ‘ Hey-Diddle-Diddle’ and composed by
<lb/>some unknown ignoramus, with a gem of resplendent lustre
<lb/>similarly entitled, the work of Thingum Bob, Esq., the cele-
<lb break="no"/>brated author of ‘ The Oil-of-Bob.’ ” The “ Goosetherumfoo-</p><p></p><p>dle” deeply “ regretted this very natural accident,” and pro-
<lb break="no"/>mised, moreover, an insertion of the genuine ‘ Hey-Diddle-
<lb break="no"/>Diddle’ in the very next number of the Magazine.</p><p></p><p>The fact is I thought—I really thought—I thought at the
<lb/>time—I thought then—and have no reason for thinking oth-
<lb break="no"/>erwise now—that the “ Goosetherumfoodle” did make a mis-
<lb break="no"/>take. With the best intentions in the world, I never knew
<lb/>any thing that made as many singular mistakes as the
<lb/>“ Goosetherumfoodle.” From that day I took a liking to the
<lb/> “ Goosetherumfoodle,” and the result was I soon saw into
<lb/> the very depths of its literary merits, and did not fail to ex-
<lb break="no"/>patiate upon them, in the “ Turtle,” whenever a fitting op-
<lb break="no"/> portunity occurred. And it is to be regarded as a very pecu-
<lb break="no"/> liar coincidence—as one of those positively remarkable coin-
<lb break="no"/> cidences which set a man to serious thinking—that just
<lb/> such a total revolution of opinion—just such entire boulever-</p><p></p><p>sement, (as we say in French,)—just such thorough topsitur-
<lb break="no"/> viness, (if I may be permitted to employ a rather forcible
<lb/> term of the Choctaws,) as happened, pro and con, between</p><p></p><p> myself on the one part, and the “Goosetherunifoodle” on
<lb/>the other, did actually again happen, in a brief period after-
<lb break="no"/> wards, and with precisely similar circumstances, in the case
<lb/>of myself and the “Rowdy-Dow,” and in the case of myself
<lb/>and the “ Hum-Drum.”</p><p></p><p>Thus it was that, by a master-stroke of genius, I at length
<lb/> consummated my triumphs by “ putting money in my purse”
<lb/>and thus may be said really and fairly to have commenced
<lb/> that brilliant and eventful career which rendered me illus-
<lb break="no"/>trious, and which now enables me to say, with Chateau-
<lb break="no"/>briand, “I have made history”—“I'ai fait l’histoire."</p><p></p><p>I have indeed “ made history.” From the bright epoch
<lb/>which I now record, my actions—my works—are the pro-
<lb break="no"/>perty of mankind. They are familiar to the world. It is,
<lb/>then, needless for me to detail how, soaring rapidly, I fell
<lb/> heir to the “ Lollipop”—how I merged this journal in the
<lb/> “ Hum-Drum”—how again I made purchase of the “ Row-
<lb break="no"/>dy-Dow,” thus combining the three periodicals—how, lastly,
<lb/>I effected a bargain for the sole remaining rival, and united
<lb/>all the literature of the country in one magnificent Magazine,
<lb/>known every where as the</p><p>“ Rowdy-Dow, Lollipop, Hum-Drum,
and
GOOSETHERUMFOODLE.”
</p><p>Yes; I have made history. My fame is universal. It ex-
<lb break="no"/>tends to the uttermost ends of the earth. You cannot take
<lb/> up a common newspaper in which you shall not see some al-
<lb break="no"/>lusion to the immortal Thingum Bob. It is Mr. Thingum Bob
<lb/> said so, and Mr. Thingum Bob wrote this, and Mr. Thingum
<lb/>Bob did that. But I am meek and expire with an humble
<lb/> heart. After all, what is it?—this indescribable something
<lb/> which men will persist in terming “ genius ?” I agree with
<lb/>Buffon—with Hogarth—it is but diligence after all.</p><p></p><p> Look at me !—how I labored—how I toiled—how I wrote !
<lb/> Ye Gods, did I not write ? I knew not the word “ ease.”
<lb/>By day I adhered to my desk, and at night, a pale student, I
<lb/>consumed the midnight oil. You should have seen me—
<lb/>you should. I leaned to the right. I leaned to the left. I
<lb/>sat forward. I sat backward. I sat upon end. I sat tete
<lb/>baissee, (as they have it in the Kickapoo,) bowing my head</p><p><pb n="39"/>
</p><p>close to the alabaster page. And, through all, I—wrote.
<lb/>Through joy and through sorrow, I—wrote. Through hung-
<lb break="no"/>er and through thirst, I—wrote. Through good report and 
<lb/>through ill report, I—wrote. Through sunshine and through 
<lb/>moonshine, I—wrote. What I wrote it is unnecessary to 
<lb/>say. The style !—that was the thing. I caught it from 
<lb/>Fatquack—whizz!—fizz !—and I am giving you a specimen
<lb/>of it now.	EDGAR A. POE.</p><p>Critical Notices.

<lb break="no"/>est for the completion of the series.</p><p></p><p>Part II. contains the second Canto of a very fine poem,
<lb/>“ The Chaunt of Life.” From the first stanza we quote the
<lb/>three remarkably beautiful lines :</p><p>Slow droop the eyelids of the drowsy day;
All weary life and every heart oppressed,
In soothing slumber now may sink to rest.
The fourth and fifth stanzas are very noble:—
Give me to love my fellow, and in love,
If with none other grace to chaunt my strain,
Sweet key-note of soft; cadences above,
Sole star of solace in life's night of pain.
Chief gem of Eden, fractured in that fall
That ruined two fond hearts, and tarnished all!
Redeemer! be thy kindly spirit mine;
That pearl of Paradise to me restore,
</p><p>Pure, fervent, fearless, lasting, love divine,
<lb/>Profound as ocean, broad as sea and shore.
<lb/>While Man I sing, free, subject, and supreme,</p><p>O!	for a soul, as ample as the theme !
Sad prelude I have sung, by Sorrow led
</p><p>Along the mournful shades that own her sway,
<lb/>Where, Ay a stream that weeping eyes have shed,
<lb/>Low chaunted I my melancholy luy,</p><p>In pensive concord with the sootheless wail
Of sighing wanderers in that lonely vale.
</p><p>Ah, chide not those whose wo seems hard to bear,
<lb/>The heart must hover where its treasures sleep;
<lb/>I saw the great, the wise, the gifted there.</p><p>With humbler multitudes compelled to weep;
No penury, no wealth commands relief!
No Serf, no Sovereign in the realms of grief!
</p><p>We Italicise two passages, however, for their defects, and
<lb/>not for their merits. We can conceive that a gem may be
<lb/>“fractured in a fall” and even (imperfectly) that in so falling
<lb/>it may “ruin two fond hearts”, but how it can “ tarnish all”
<lb/>or anything, in so falling, does not appear. The stream of
<lb/>tears is in shockingly bad taste. But the stately and pensive
<lb/>thought and well-sustained modulation of the stanzas amply
<lb/>redeem these demerits.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Hoyt is occasionally halting in his metre, although
<lb/>rarely or ever in his rhythm. In stanza VIII. a foot is miss-
<lb break="no"/>ng in the fifth line :</p><p>Rise ! with heroic strength be strong.
In stanza XII. there is a superfluous foot in the second line:
</p><p>Ecbatana and Babylon and Tyre remote—
<lb/>although the stanza as a whole is particularly sonorous and
<lb/>Miltonic.</p><p></p><p>The poem entitled “Old” has so many rare and peculiar
<lb/>excellences, that we shall venture to copy it in full. It will
<lb/>forcibly remind our readers of Mr. Durand’s exquisite picture
<lb/>“ An Old Man’s Recollections”—although between poem and
<lb/>painting there is nothing more than a perfectly admissible
<lb/>similarity. The quaintness is, in our opinion, to be defended
<lb/>as a legitimate effect, conferring high pleasure upon a nume-
<lb break="no"/>rous and cultivated class of minds. In his continuous and
<lb/>absolutely uniform repetition of the first line in the last of
<lb/>each stanza, he has by much exceeded the legitimate limits
<lb/>of the quaint, and impinged upon the simply ludicrous. The
<lb/>poem, nevertheless, abounds in lofty merit, and has, in espe-
<lb break="no"/>cial, some exquisite passages of pathos and of imagination.
<lb/>We Italicise some of these.</p><p>OLD.
By the way-side, on a mossy stone
Sat a hoary pilgrim sadly musing;
Oft I marked him sitting there alone,
All the landscape like a page perusing ;
Poor, unknown,
By the way-side, on a mossy stone.
Buckled knee and shoe, and broad-rimmed hat,
Coat as ancient as the form ’twas folding,
Silver buttons, queue, and crimped cravat,
Oaken staff, his feeble hand upholding,
There he sat !
Buckled knee and shoe, and broad-rimmed hat.
Seemed it pitiful he should sit there.
No one sympathizing, no one heeding,
None to love him for his thin grey hair,
And the furrows all so mutely pleading,
Age, and care;
Seemed it pitiful he should sit there.
It was summer, and we went to school.
</p><p>Dapper country lads and little maidens,
<lb/>Taught the motto of the “ Dunce’s Stool,’i
<lb/>Its grave import still my fancy ladens,</p><p>“ Here’s a FOOL!’’
It was summer, and we went to school.
</p><p>When the stranger seemed to mark our play,
<lb/>(Some of us were joyous, some sad-hearted,
<lb/>I remember well,—too well,—that day !)
<lb/>Oftentimes the tears unbidden started,—
<lb/>Would not stay !</p><p>When the stranger seemed to mark our play.
One sweet spirit broke the silent spell—
Ah!to me her name was always heaven
She besought him all his grief to tell,—
(I was then thirteen, and she eleven,)
Isabel!
One sweet spirit broke the silent spell.
Angel, said he sadly, I am old ;
Earthly hope no longer hath a morrow,
</p><p>Yet why I sit here thou shall soon be told,
<lb/>Then his eye betrayed a pearl of sorrow,—
<lb/>Down it rolled !</p><p>Angel, said he sadly, I am old !
</p><p>I have tottered here to look once more
<lb/>On the pleasant scene where I delighted
<lb/>In the careless, happy days of yore,</p><p>Ere the garden of my heart was blighted—
To the core!
I have tottered here to look once more !
<pb n="40"/>
All the picture now to me how dear!
E'en this gray old rock where I am seated,
Is a jewel worth a journey here;
Ah, that such a scene must be completed
With a tear!
All the picture now to me how dear!
Old stone School-House !—it is still the same !
</p><p>There’s the very step so oft I mounted;
<lb/>There’s the window creaking in its frame,
<lb/>And the notches that I cut and counted
<lb/>For the game;</p><p>Old stone School-House !—it is still the same !
In the cottage, yonder, I was born :
Long my happy home—that humble dwelling ;
There the fields of clover, wheat, and corn,
There the spring, with limpid nectar swelling ;
Ah, Forlorn!—
In the cottage, yonder, I was born.
Those two gate-way sycamores you see,
Then were planted, just so far asunder
That long well-pole from the path to free,
And the wagon to pass safely under-
Ninety-three
Those two gate-way sycamores you see ?
There’s the orchard where we used to climb
When my mates and I were boys together,
Thinking nothing of the flight of lime,
Fearing nought but work and rainy weather;
Past its prime!
There’s the orchard where we used to climb !
There, the rude, three-cornered chestnut rails,
Round the pasture where the flocks were grazing,
</p><p>Where so sly, I used to watch for quails
<lb/>In the crops of buckwheat we were raising,—
<lb/>Traps and trails,—</p><p>There, the rude, three-cornered chesnut rails.
There’s the mill that ground our yellow grain ;
Pond, and river still serenely flowing ;
Cot, there nestling in the shaded lane,
Where the lily of my heart was blowing,—
Mary Jane !
There’s the mill that ground our yellow grain !
There’s the gate on which I used to swing,
Brook and bridge, and barn, and old red stable;
But alas ! the morn shall no more bring
That dear group around my father’s table ;
Taken wing !
There’s the gate on which I used to swing !
I am fleeing !—all I loved are fled;
Yon green meadow was our place for playing;
</p><p>That old tree can tell of sweet things said,
<lb/>When around it Jane and I were straying;—
<lb/>She is dead !</p><p>I am fleeing!—all I loved are fled !
Yon white spire—a pencil on the sky.
Tracing silently life’s changeful story,
So familiar to my dim old eye,
Points me to seven that are now in glory
There on high
Yon white spire, a pencil on the sky !
Oft the aisle of that old church we trod,
Guided thither by an angel mother;
Now she sleeps beneath its sacred sod,—
Sire and sisters, and my little brother—
Gone to God !
Oft the aisle of that old church we trod !
There I heard of Wisdom’s pleasant ways,
Bless the holy lesson !—but, ah, never
Shall I hear again those songs of praise,
Those sweet voices,—silent now forever !
Peaceful days!
There I heard of Wisdom’s pleasant ways.
</p><p>There my Mary blest me with her hand,
<lb/>When our soul drank in the nuptial blessing,
<lb/>Ere she hastened to the spirit-land;</p><p>Yonder turf her gentle bosom pressing :
Broken band!
There my Mary blest me with her hand.
I have come to see that grave once more,
</p><p>And the sacred place where we delighted,
<lb/>Where we worshipped in the days of yore,
<lb/>Ere the garden of my heart was blighted
<lb/>To the core !</p><p>I have come to see that grave once more.
Angel, said he, sadly, I am old !
Earthly hope no longer hath a morrow;
Now why I sit here thou hast been told;
In his eye another pearl of sorrow,—
Down it rolled !
Angel, said he, sadly, I am old !
By the wayside, on a mossy stone,
Sat the hoary pilgrim, sadly musing;
Still I marked him sitting there alone,
All the landscape, like a page perusing;
Poor, unknown,
By the way-side, on a mossy stone !
The stanza commencing “ Buckled knee and shoe,” &amp;c.
</p><p> puts us somewhat too forcibly in mind of Oliver Wendell
<lb/>Holmes’ “Old Man.” The exclamation “Ninety-Three!”
<lb/>introduced, as it is, independently of the observations which
<lb/> surround it, must be regarded as one of the happiest instan-
<lb break="no"/>ces either of refined art or of natural pathos.</p><p>“The stanza beginning “Yon white spire” cannot be too
 warmly commended.
</p><p>“ New” is a pendant to “ Old,” but its artificiality of con-
<lb break="no"/>struction is even more displeasingly apparent. We quote
<lb/>one or two sweet passages :</p><p></p><p>Ah, June can only charm her eyes
<lb/>With flowers of paradisial dyes
<lb/>And azure skies.</p><p>This, however, should read, “ Ah, only June,” &amp;c.
The glowing tranquil summertime;
The summertime;
Too listless in a maiden’s prime ;
Dull melancholy pantomime !
Oh for a gay autumnal clime !
Too listless in a maiden’s prime
The summertime.
Love nestles in that gentle breast—
That gentle breast.
Ah Love will never let it rest—
The cruel sly ungrateful guest
(A viper in a linnet’s nest)
Ah Love will never let it rest—
That gentle breast.'
</p><p>“Boemus” is the concluding poem of the volume, and is
<lb/>marked by the same peculiarities of metre—peculiarities,
<lb/>however, which, in a composition such as this, must be con-
<lb break="no"/>sidered out of place. We conclude our review with the quo-
<lb break="no"/>tation of a very spirited stanza—a stanza which would do no
<lb/>discredit to Campbell, and is much in his vein :</p><p>O’er all the silent sky

But darker scowled each eye

When (night of dread renown!)
Three thousand stars went down!

</p><p>French Opera—Park Theatre.—The intense heat of the
<lb/>weather has been sadly injurious to the success of the vari-
<lb break="no"/>ous theatres, keeping away hundreds who would otherwise
<lb/>have visited such places of amusement.</p><p></p><p>La Juive has been represented once, but we were unable
<lb/>to attend. It was, however, we understand, very successful,
<lb/>having been produced on a scale of the greatest magnificence.
<lb/>Should it be again performed, we will describe it fully.</p><p></p><p>La Fille du Regiment was produced last week. If Doni-
<lb break="no"/>zetti had never written any thing but La Fille du Regiment
<lb/>and L’ E'isir d'Amore, his name would surely be preserved
<lb/>for posterity. There are many beauties of high character in
<lb/>all his serious operas, but he is never so thoroughly at home
<lb/>as in the works of lighter character. Throughout both the
<lb/>operas mentioned there is a continued flow of delicious me-
<lb break="no"/>lody, varied and original in its character; the concerted pie-
<lb break="no"/>ces also exhibit an unusual degree of excellence, and the in-
<lb break="no"/>strumentation is of a higher order of merit, being more richly
<lb/>and variously harmonized. La Fille du Regiment is truly
<lb/>French. Donizetti has most happily imitated the peculiarity
<lb/>of the school. It lacks however the quaintness of Auber,
<lb/>and sometimes the Italian school intrudes, as in the lovely
<lb/>romance, “ Il faut partir,” sung by Marie ; but as a whole it
<lb/>is an admirable conception, worked out with masterly skill.</p><p>The cast was as follows :
Marie (La Fille du Regiment) . . . M’lle Calve.
Marchioness de Berkenfeldt .... M’me Mathieu.
Ten o, a Tyrolinn peasant........M. Buscher.
Sulpice, a sergeant..............M. Bernard.
Hortensius, a steward............M. Mathieu.
</p><p>M'lle Calve personated La Fille most admirably. Her
<lb/>manner was that of a pelted child of rude but chivalric men
<lb/>—a happy mixture of playful boldness and shrinking maiden
<lb/>modesty. In all that M'lle Calve does, she is a true woman
<lb/>—whether as the playful coquette, teasing but tender, wil-
<lb break="no"/>ful to commit a fault, but eager and earnest to sue for for-
<lb break="no"/>giveness; or as the young girl, whose nature, full of the
<lb/>stronger and deeper emotions, gratitude and affection for her
<lb/>protectors, and love for one who loves her fondly in return ;
<lb/>whether as the wild and light-hearted vivandiere, or as the
<lb/>titled lady—Mile Calve is the true woman in all, faithful to
<lb/>life in every phase of the character.</p><p></p><p>Of her singing we can truly say, that in the character of
<lb/>Marie she exhibits more excellence than in any other cha-
<lb break="no"/>racter she has appeared in. Her execution of “ Il faut par-
<lb break="no"/>tir” was a beautiful exhibition of deep, tender, and regretful
<lb/>feeling. " Chacun le sait” was admirable for its point and
<lb/>finish, and the enthusiasm with which she gave “ Salut a la
<lb/>France,” could only be equalled by the reception it met with
<lb/>from the audience. She dressed the part with her usual
<lb/>taste,—which is perfection. We hope to see her repeat this
<lb/>character.</p><p></p><p>Madame Mathieu as the Marchioness Berkenfield, elicited
<lb/>general approbation. Her acting and singing in the trio,
<lb/>“ Le jour naissait,’’was not to be surpassed; while in the
<lb/>graver portions of the character she was equally good. Her
<lb/>second dress was in truth a most admirable costume.</p><p>M. Coeuriot, who was to have played Tonio, continuing
THE BROADWAY JOURNAL.
</p><p>seriously indisposed, M. Buscher, at two days’ notice, had to
<lb/>undertake the part. He acquitted himself very creditably, 
<lb/>His voice is not quite equal to the music, although it is cer-
<lb break="no"/>tain that he would have appeared to much greater advan-
<lb break="no"/>tage had he been more familiar with the music.</p><p></p><p>M. Bernard, as the old Sergeant, is deserving of our warm- 
<lb/>est commendation. Not for one moment did he forget the 
<lb/>character of the Old Soldier. It was a true picture from the 
<lb/>beginning to the end. The sternness of the old warrior, the
<lb/>tender affection for La Fille, and the quiet quizzing of the
<lb/>peculiarities of the antiquated Marchioness, each received at
<lb/>his hands full justice. His singing was correctly and artisti-
<lb break="no"/>cally rendered.</p><p>The acting of M. Mathieu as the Steward, was an exqui-
site piece of quiet humour.
The chorusses were well executed, although scarcely equal
to some former performances.
</p><p>The Band displayed its usual excellence. In the finale to
<lb/>the second act, however, where the short fugue passage oc-
<lb break="no"/>curs, there was much obscurity among the stringed instru-
<lb break="no"/>ments, but M. Prevost ably retrieved the error. We must
<lb/>particularly compliment M. Ribas for his exquisite perform-
<lb break="no"/>ance upon the “ Chor Anglaise” in Marie’s song, “ Il faut
<lb/>partir”; also the first violoncellist for his obligato accompa-
<lb break="no"/>niment in the second act.</p><p></p><p>Opening of the Organ for Trinity Church, New Ha-
<lb break="no"/>ven.—We were present at Mr. Erben’s Factory, Centre-
<lb break="no"/>street, on the occasion of the exhibition of an organ built for
<lb/>the above church.</p><p>The following is a statement of the construction, &amp;c., &amp;c.
</p><p>The organ is contained in a splendid gothic case of black
<lb/>walnut. It has two complete sets of keys and two octaves of
<lb/>pedals.</p><p>GREAT ORGAN.	13	Principal.
1 Open Diapason (metal pipes  	14 Hautboy,
throughout.)	15	Trumpet.
2	Stop Diapason.	16	Cornet.
3	Principal.		--
 4 Twelfth.	CHOIR BASS.
 5 Fifteenth.	17 Stop Diapason.

10 Open Diapason.	20 Gt. Organ and Swell.
11 Stop Diapason.	21 Gt. Organ and Pedals.
12 Dulciano.	22 Pedals and Choir Organ.
</p><p>It will be seen by this statement that the organ, although
<lb/>it is by no means a large instrument, possesses considerable 
<lb/>power; indeed, for its size, it possesses extraordinary power. 
<lb/>A coupling movement for the Great Organ and Swell, which 
<lb/>goes as low as C below Fiddle G, gives great power to the
<lb/>instrument and enriches the Great Organ exceedingly, when
<lb/>used either full or in part. The pedals down to 16 foot C, are
<lb/>very good, speaking almost immediately, and being equal
<lb/>throughout.</p><p></p><p>The Reed Stops are admirable ; we must particularize the
<lb/>exceeding beauty and delicacy of the Hautboy in the Swell,
<lb/>and of the rough, full, and truly characteristic quality of the
<lb/>trumpet in the same department, showing great improve-
<lb break="no"/>ment in a few years in these particular stops. The Flute is
<lb/>in the Great Organ, and is very mellow, soft and delicate. It
<lb/>can be used as a solo stop with more convenience and better
<lb/>effect than if it were in the Swell. Organ builders should
<lb/>bear this in mind, and never put the Flute Stop in any other
<lb/>than the Great Organ or Choir.</p><p></p><p>To the Diapasons generally we must award unqualified
<lb/>praise; they are exceedingly heavy and rich. The Pedals
<lb/>may be coupled either with the Great Organ or Swell, or both.</p><p></p><p>The omission of Composition Pedals is, however, much to be
<lb/>regretted, as they so greatly facilitate the labor of the organ-
<lb break="no"/>ist, in the rapid change of stops necessary to produce striking
<lb/>effects.</p><p></p><p>Shortly after we went in, Mr. W. A. King, Organist of St.
<lb/>Peter’s Church, sat down to the organ. Mr. King is acknow-
<lb break="no"/>ledged to be the most eminently capable man of all men in
<lb/>the country, to show off an organ, of whatever size, to the
<lb/>greatest advantage. As an extemporaneous player, we have
<lb/>not met his equal on this continent; his fancy is brilliant,
<lb/>—his thoughts of beauty succeed each other in rapid succes-
<lb break="no"/>sion ; he handles his subject with much clearness; these
<lb/>qualifications, combined with his perfect knowledge of the
<lb/>various and beautiful combinations, and his complete mastery
<lb/>over the King of Instruments, have gained for him his high
<lb/>and well-earned reputation. His performance on this occa-
<lb break="no"/>sion was extemporaneous; in it he introduced several beauti-
<lb break="no"/>ful airs from Robert Le Diable. So masterly was his perfor-
<lb break="no"/>mance—so various and so orchestral was his treatment of his
<lb/>themes, that he kept a very miscellaneous audience rapt and
<lb/>silent for something more than half an hour—the hightest tri-
<lb break="no"/>bute that could be paid to his genius.</p><p></p><p>Altogether, we were much delighted with the exhibition,
<lb/>and we consider that the congregation of Trinity Church, N.
<lb/>H., cannot fail to be truly gratified with their purchase.</p><p></p><p>Musical Review. — Oh! Say Not; Sing a Careless Lay.

</p><p>The first song is in E minor, common time. It is construct-
<lb break="no"/>ed upon the simplest form of English ballads. The first eight
<lb/>bars are in E minor ; it then changes for a brief period into C
<lb/>minor, returning again to the original key. The melody is
<lb/>exceedingly plaintive and expressive, and, although the
<lb/>closes are somewhat hackneyed and common-place, yet the
<lb/>accompaniments are so full and so judiciously used they re-
<lb break="no"/>deem and dignify the character of the song. A false relation
<lb/>occurs in the twelfth bar of each verse, where the right hand
<lb/>accompaniment and the voice descend in seconds, making a
<lb/>most inharmonious effect. A false accent is also given in
<lb/>the third verse to the word ‘joyously.’ The accent falls with
<lb/>a minim note upon the penultimate syllabic. This should
<lb/>always be avoided in order to preserve the integrity of the
<lb/>pronunciation. The poetry is pretty and full of sentiment,
<lb/>and is modelled after the style which Haynes Bayley render-
<lb break="no"/>ed so popular.</p><p>It is got out in excellent style.
</p><p>The second song is by far the most melodious composition
<lb/>we have seen from Mr. Saroni's pen. It is truly a gushing
<lb/>forth of feeling and sensibility. A right hearty “Welcome
<lb/>to his Sister" was evidently the feeling nearest to his heart,
<lb/>and he has expressed it with singular fidelity. We recom-
<lb break="no"/>mend this song most earnestly to our musical friends. The
<lb/>poetry by Mr. J. B. Phillips is smooth and agreeable, and ex-
<lb break="no"/>presses a warm and amiable sensibility. The third song is
<lb/>in C minor, 3-4 time. Its character is mournful to a painful
<lb/>degree. The principal subject is to be found in the symphony,
<lb/>and is given to the left hand. It is well carried out through</p><p><pb n="43"/>
</p><p>the song, and imparts to it a sad and reflective lone, which
<lb/>forcibly impresses the hearer. This song has not the stamp
<lb/>of genuineness so strongly marked as the second under
<lb/>notice, but it is a good song.</p><p></p><p>All these songs are got out in admirable style by J. F.
<lb/>Nunns, 240 Broadway. Our musical friends would do well
<lb/>to look them through.</p><p>The Drama.
</p><p>At Niblo's, Mrs. Mowatt is still delighting large, fashion-
<lb break="no"/>able, and very intellectual audiences, who testify their sym-
<lb break="no"/>pathy with the woman, not less than their approbation of the
<lb/>actress, by the most profound and respectful attention.</p><p></p><p>Last week we had seen the fair debutante only in Pauline,
<lb/>but we have since been charmed with her delineations of Juli-
<lb break="no"/>ana, in “The Honeymoon,” and Lucy Ashton, in “ The Bride
<lb/>of Lammermoor.” The former of these plays has very little
<lb/>to recommend it—especially to Mrs. Mowatt. Its leading
<lb/>incident is grossly absurd. A duke (Aranza,) wedding, in his
<lb/>character of duke, a haughty gentlewoman (Juliana) makes
<lb/>her believe, after marriage, that he is not only a peasant, but
<lb/>more entirely brutal and disgusting than peasant ever yet
<lb/>was. He maltreats her in almost every way—sneers at her—
<lb/>insists upon her standing up in his presence and attending his
<lb/>friends in the capacity of a slave—locks her up in her cham-
<lb break="no"/>ber—refuses her communication with her parents—does every
<lb/>thing in short but strike her—and makes his brutality only
<lb/>the more odious by putting on, at one point, the airs of a man
<lb/>of honor—drawing down the rapturous approbation of the
<lb/>audience by certain rhodomontade to the effect that</p><p>“ Whoever lays his hand upon a woman,
Save in the way of kindness, is a villain
Whom’t were base flattery to call a coward.”
</p><p>—as if the severest personal chastisement he could have in-
<lb break="no"/>flicted would not have been less cowardly than his other
<lb/>bestial affronts to her dignity and honor. But all this would
<lb/>be nothing, if we were not required to believe that, by such
<lb/>conduct, the duke finally subdues the haughty temper of his
<lb/>wife, and actually secures her most passionate love! These
<lb/>things are so grossly unnatural as to destroy all the verisimi-
<lb break="no"/>litude of the play—and the total irrelevancy of the under-plots
<lb/>confirm the difficulty and strengthen the disgust. “ The
<lb/>Honeymoon,” in short, is a wretched affair, which has been
<lb/>unluckily saved to the stage (for its sins) by a number of spark-
<lb break="no"/>ling points well adapted to tell with audiences too ill-culti-
<lb break="no"/>vated to estimate merit otherwise than in detail—and especi-
<lb break="no"/>ally by a quality which, so far from saving it, should have
<lb/>secured its instant condemnation—we mean its palpable pla-
<lb break="no"/>giarism of all the worst demerits of “The Taming of the
<lb/>Shrew.”</p><p></p><p>In Juliana—because Juliana is a role altogether out of na-
<lb break="no"/>ture—we did not expect Mrs. Mowatt to do much—for not
<lb/>much is there for any one to do. So far as a gracefully dash-
<lb break="no"/>ing demeanour goes, she nevertheless accomplished some-
<lb break="no"/>thing—and</p><p>Oh what a deal of scorn looks beautiful
In the contempt and anger of her lip !
</p><p>We were delighted, however, to find her announced as
<lb/>Lucy in “ The Bride of Lammermoor,” for our remembran-
<lb break="no"/>ces of this opera were connected only with the music of Bel-
<lb break="no"/>lini and the glowing romance of Scott. If, in all the litera-
<lb break="no"/>ture of fiction, there is a character for which Mrs. Mowatt is
<lb/>peculiarly adapted, it is the Lucy Ashton of the original
<lb/>“Bride of Lammermoor.” If the authoress of “Fashion”
<lb/>knew her own strength, she would confine herself, nearly al- </p><p></p><p>together, to the depicting in letters, as well as on the stage,
<lb/>the more gentle sentiments and the most profound passions.
<lb/>Her sympathy with the latter is evidently intense. In the ut-
<lb break="no"/>terance of the truly generous—of the really noble—of the un-
<lb break="no"/>affectedly passionate—we see her bosom heave—her cheek
<lb/>grow pale—her limbs tremble—her chiselled lip quiver—and
<lb/>Nature's own tear rush impetuously to the eye. Now it is
<lb/>this freshness of the heart which will provide for her the
<lb/>greenest laurels. It is this enthusiasm—this well of deep
<lb/>feeling—which should be made to prove to her an exhaustless
<lb/>source of fame ! As actress, it is to her a mine of wealth—
<lb/>worth all the dawdling instructions in the world. Mrs.
<lb/>Mowatt, as she now stands, is quite as able to give lessons in
<lb/>stage routine to any actor or actress in America, as is any
<lb/>actor or actress to give lessons to her. Let her throw all
<lb/>support to the winds—trust proudly to her own grace of man-
<lb break="no"/>ner—her own sense of art—her own rich and natural elocu-
<lb break="no"/>tion—and let her be assured that these qualities, as she now
<lb/>possesses them, are all sufficient, when considered simply as
<lb/>the means by which the great end of natural acting is to be
<lb/>consummated—as the mere instruments by which she may
<lb/>effectively and unimpededly lay bare to the audience the
<lb/>movements of her own passionate heart.</p><p></p><p>Feeling this—being well assured, from first seeing Mrs.
<lb/>Mowatt as Pauline, that her forte lay in the depicting of
<lb/>passion, we were anxious to see her in Juliet (a part which
<lb/>will yet render her immortal) and were delighted when we
<lb/>saw her announced for Lucy Ashton. But alas ! it was
<lb/> Scott’s Lucy and not the Opera Lucy of which we dreamed.
<lb/>The play, as we saw it on Tuesday, is miserably ineffective
<lb/>—and the remembrance of that most passionate and roman-
<lb break="no"/>tic of novels, will intrude itself to render the defects of the
<lb/>dramatization more palpable. We even fancied that we
<lb/> could perceive the depressing influence of this remembrance
<lb/>in the countenance of Mrs. Mowatt. With a bosom full of
<lb/>emotion, she seemed to suffer from the total insufficiency of
<lb/>the words of the dramatist, to give utterance to her thought.
<lb/>But what was to be done was done to admiration. The
<lb/>actress lost no opportunity. The appeal to the mother was
<lb/>very noble acting. The signing of the contract, and the wild
<lb/>shriek at the sudden entrance of Edgar, would have done
<lb/>honor to any one. The apathetic and mute despair at the
<lb/>conclusion of the play, and during the interview with Ravens-
<lb break="no"/>wood in the mother’s presence—the dumb uncomprehending
<lb/>wretchedness—the half-conscious rendering up of the broken
<lb/>gold—the laboring anxiety for the relief of words—the final
<lb/>maddening confession, heart-breaking, and death in the
<lb/>lover’s arms—were the teachings not of Mr. Crisp, but of
<lb/>Nature herself—speaking in tones that could not be misun-
<lb break="no"/>derstood. The audience grew pale, and were betrayed into
<lb/>silence and tears—and if any one went away sneering that
<lb/>night, it is at least quite certain that he felt ashamed of the
<lb/>sneer.</p><p>The Fine Arts.
</p><p>Joseph Bonaparte's Collection of Paintings.—It will
<lb/>doubtless prove a source of high gratification to all who feel
<lb/>interested in the Fine Arts, that the valuable paintings which
<lb/>Joseph Bonapate collected together at Bordentown, will not
<lb/>be transmitted to England for sale, but will be sold at Borden-
<lb break="no"/>town on the 17th and 13th of September next. Such a col-
<lb break="no"/>lection should not be divided. It should form the nucleus of
<lb/>a great gallery.</p><p>If the wealthy and ardent admirers of the Fine Arts in
<pb n="44"/>
</p><p>New York, would but take the matter in hand, how easy it
<lb/>would he, by subscription, to purchase the entire collection
<lb/>for New York.</p><p></p><p>Why should not Mr. Astor give to our city this collection ?
<lb/>It would be a gift to posterity, and would make his name his-
<lb break="no"/>torical with the progress of the Fine Arts in this country.</p><p></p><p>Catalogues, which will be sent to the numerous institutions
<lb/>through the whole range of the country, are now in prepara-

<lb/>Fine Arts.—While defending the National Academy against
<lb/>the ill-judged remarks, false accusations, and grossly ignor-
<lb break="no"/>ant misstatements which appeared in the Herald a short
<lb/>time since, we wish it to be distinctly understood that we
<lb/>are no partisans of the Academy or its supporters. What
<lb/>we have done is simply an act of common justice to the Aca-
<lb break="no"/>demy ; at the same time it is an act of duty imperative on us
<lb/>to endeavor to disabuse the public mind of any false impres-
<lb break="no"/>sions which the article in the Herald was calculated to con-
<lb break="no"/>vey.</p><p></p><p>The following quotations from the Herald will clearly
<lb/>prove the utter ignorance of the writer in question, of all that
<lb/>appertains to the National Academy, its constitution, and
<lb/>the intention of its establishment.</p><p></p><p>National Academy of Design.—This institution has now closed its
<lb/>exhibition for the season, and one or two remarks in review may be
<lb/>made with propriety. One of these applies to the character of the
<lb/>works, and on this topic we have to say, that little improvement has
<lb/>been observable in the pictures over those of former seasons. This
<lb/>stationary state of the exhibition is a matter of regret, and totally at
<lb/>variance with the specific end and object of the association, which are
<lb/>by introducing to public notice, and awards of premiums to excellence,
<lb/>to develop latent talent, encourage genius, and foster a true taste. To
<lb/>accomplish this, no person who reads the discourses of Sir Joshua
<lb/>Reynolds, and other standard writings on the Fine Arts, can overlook
<lb/>the essential importance of high models to the education of the artist.
<lb/>This admitted, the inference is obvious, that for the improvement of
<lb/>students at least, a few works of a high order of excellence would be
<lb/>of infinitely more service than the most extensive accumulations of
<lb/>mediocre or worthless pictures, such as compose the major part of
<lb/>those displayed every season by the Academy of Design.</p><p></p><p>To the first remark we would simply reply that the rooms
<lb/>of the Academy were open as usual for the works of every
<lb/>artist, but if the artists will not improve from year to year,
<lb/>surely the Council of the Academy is not to be blamed. In
<lb/>the next place, the object of the institution is not to award
<lb/>premiums, but simply to instruct young students, and to offer
<lb/>them when sufficiently advanced, and other artists, a medium
<lb/>through which their works may be presented to the public.
<lb/>The Academy offers no premium to the exhibitor. The
<lb/>exhibition is composed of the works of artists and not of pu-
<lb break="no"/>pils. When an artist ceases to be a pupil, he ceases to ac-
<lb break="no"/>knowledge the competency if any tribunal to judge of his
<lb/>works short of that of public opinion. To the award of that
<lb/>tribunal he cheerfully submits, and the prize he contends for
<lb/>is Fame.</p><p></p><p>The introduction of Sir Joshua Reynolds’ name would
<lb/>have much weight, did the opinions quoted from him bear
<lb/>any relation to the subject in question. The accumulation
<lb/>of valuable pictures is the province of the directors of a
<lb/>National Gallery, which gallery should be opened, as in
<lb/>England, France, &amp;c. certain days in the week, for the study
<lb/>of the pupils of the National Academy.</p><p></p><p>"Another fault attributable to it is the mode of its management,
<lb/>which we are sorry to say does not betray liberality, or solicitude for
<lb/>the character of the body. Cliques are bad enough, and detestable
<lb/>under any circumstances; but to allow their influence over an institu-
<lb break="no"/>tion avowedly dedicated to one or more of the Fine Arts, smells of
<lb/>sacrilege. What do the “ Council” then say to the charge against the
<lb/>composition of the body—that it is made up of a coterie of painters, to
<lb/>the exclusion of those who are not—that they practise a system of fa-</p><p></p><p>voritism, giving prominence often to wretched daubs, because the au-
<lb break="no"/>thors have influence with them, and consigning to neglect works of
<lb/>merit or of promise, for reasons best known to themselves, and the
<lb/>sufferers from their partiality.”</p><p></p><p>What defence can we make to the terrible charge that
<lb/>“artists,” and only artists, presume to manage an institution
<lb/>devoted to instruction in the arts? We will merely inquire
<lb/> if persons ignorant of music are more competent to teach
<lb/> than musicians ?—if one who never read a law book is more
<lb/> capable to defend a cause than a practised lawyer? When
<lb/> these questions are answered in the affirmative universally,
<lb/> this charge will have some weight, but until then we trust
<lb/> that every professional association will be managed by pro-
<lb break="no"/>fessional men.</p><p></p><p>The charge of unfairness in the conduct of the hanging
<lb/>committee, scarcely needs a reply. Their task is a most dif-
<lb break="no"/>ficult and a most unthankful one. That they are accused of
<lb/>unfairness is not to us a matter of surprise—had they not
<lb/>been so accused would indeed have been surprising, for what
<lb/>artist that ever exhibited but believed his works (however
<lb/>wretched) deserving of the very best place upon the walls.
<lb/>This charge is too frivolous to require further comment.</p><p></p><p>“ Once more, wo reproach the Council of the Academy of Design
<lb/>With giving a sordid and gravelling character to their policy. They
<lb/>do not seem to be aware that money making is not the object of the
<lb/>institution, or are ignorant of the truth that the gain of pence and the
<lb/>acquisition of taste and artistical skill, have no connection with—no
<lb/>affinity for each other. Making money is not the end to be sought in
<lb/>these exhibitions, and yet there is good ground for binning the mana-
<lb break="no"/>gers for a departure from this truth. Instead of concocting narrow
<lb/>plans for gain, it is the office of the managers to disburse all the funds
<lb/>they are able in patronising and encouraging merit without favor or
<lb/>partiality ; and one mode of doing so would be the establishment of a
<lb/>Drawing School, which has been too long neglected. We want to see
<lb/>this Academy of Design with an “odor of nationality about it,” and
<lb/>to have that it must not be narrow, sordid, or illiberal, but comprehen-
<lb break="no"/>sive in its objects, simple in its operations, and elevated in its motives
<lb/> —then it will be what it professes to be, an American Academy of
<lb/>Design.”</p><p></p><p>To this last charge of “ sordid and grovelling policy” we
<lb/>have only to oppose facts. Not one single cent of the money
<lb/>received from the public exhibition has ever been appropria-
<lb break="no"/>ted to the personal uses of the members of the Academy.
<lb/>The whole of such proceeds has been expended in sustaining
<lb/> the institution, as the reports will triumphantly show.</p><p></p><p>The last two sentences of the Herald’s sagacious article
<lb/>cap the climax of the writer’s incredible ignorance, and
<lb/>shameless assurance. Has the man been sleeping for the
<lb/>last twenty years? or were his statements merely wilful and
<lb/>malicious slanders, penned with the intention to prejudice
<lb/> the public against the National Academy? We are com-
<lb break="no"/>pelled to believe the latter suggestion, arguing from the illib-
<lb break="no"/>eral tone of the article throughout. This person actually
<lb/> asks the Council of the National Academy why they do not
<lb/>establish a drawing academy ? Why, such a school has been
<lb/>in existence for the last twenty years! It was established
<lb/>by and supported always from the funds of the Academy.</p><p></p><p> It is open several months in the winter season for students—
<lb/>free of expense. Some of the finest casts, from the antique,
<lb/>in the world, are at the service of the students. In fact the
<lb/>number of classical models in the school is very great. Be-
<lb break="no"/>sides statuary the student has the advantage of drawing
<lb/>from the life figure; to procure which is a heavy tax upon
<lb/>the funds of the society. These advantages are freely of-
<lb break="no"/>fered, gratuitously, to young persons desirous of studying the
<lb/>art, and the number of pupils to this school, collected from
<lb/>all parts of the country, has been sixty and upwards every
<lb/>year. Does this smack of “sordid and grovelling policy"?
<lb/>Is this the conduct of narrow-minded or illiberal men? If
<lb/>they desired to keep the entire public patronage, why should
<lb/>they voluntarily instruct so large a number of young men,</p><p><pb n="45"/>
</p><p>some of whom might naturally be expected to deprive them
<lb/>of some portion of that patronage, when they might if they
<lb/>choose appropriate that money to themselves, which is now
<lb/>as it were the means of existence and fume to hundreds.</p><p></p><p>The Academy has its faults, but there is so much that is
<lb/>excellent in it that we have thought it proper to put the pub-
<lb break="no"/>lic in possession of the facts. In our future numbers we
<lb/>shall make the public acquainted with the history of this so-
<lb break="no"/>ciety and the benefits it has conferred upon the artist in this
<lb/>country.</p><p>SONNET.——SILENCE.

First Report of the Female Department of the Prison Asso-
ciation of New York.
</p><p>The object of this most praiseworthy attempt is to give
<lb/>the convict a fair chance for re-commencing life, on equal
<lb/>terms with those amongst whom he finds him or herself, when
<lb/>released from confinement. The idea is one capable of the
<lb/>best results, if fairly carried out; which we feel assured it
<lb/>will be, when intrusted to such hands as it appears naturally
<lb/>to have fallen into. No public reform appears to us so loud-
<lb break="no"/>ly to be called for, or with so much justice, as that which
<lb/>would ameliorate the condition of the prisoners in or cut of
<lb/>jail: and, perhaps, from the existing state of things, it is
<lb/>even more incumbent upon society to help him from getting
<lb/>into prison, than in the first instance even to send him there.
<lb/>When we consider the stigma attached to the fact of ever
<lb/>having been confined in a prison, (whether justly or unjustly) ;
<lb/>that it too often casts a blight upon a man’s character and
<lb/>prospects, from which he rarely recovers: and then only-
<lb break="no"/>from admirable resolution, patience, and a most uncommon
<lb/>force of mind and character: it is a most solemn prompting
<lb/>of the conscience that commands us to treat the victim of
<lb/>folly, of ignorance, or of crime, with at least the same toler-
<lb break="no"/>ant spirit, the same equal justice which we ourselves would
<lb/>hope for, in the same situation.</p><p></p><p>The fact really is, that very many are obliged to ‘commit’
<lb/>themselves, or perish by the bleak freezing of neglect;’ that
<lb/>to obtain a shelter and food to sustain life, they must e’en
<lb/>return to the hated jail.</p><p></p><p>That a small number, like Mr. Rathbun of Buffalo, whom
<lb/>we have ever admired for his enterprise and public spirit:
<lb/>whom we have thought a much more eminent man than
<lb/>many of his fellow speculators and tempters to doubtful
<lb/>schemes of profit; whose offence considered not as a selfish
<lb/>crime, but as springing from a desire to advance the public
<lb/>interests, and to interweave his name (a laudable ambition)
<lb/>with his favorite town, we might almost pardon as venial,
<lb/>were not justice the most exacting of all virtues—that not a</p><p></p><p>few like him, by dint of energy, the salient spring of self-confi-
<lb break="no"/>dence, and great activity of mind, can occasionally recover
<lb/>lost ground, perhaps become better and alter many thereby,
<lb/>is no argument against a society like the present, whose aim
<lb/>is to help the vast majority, who are not able to help them-
<lb break="no"/> selves.</p><p></p><p>The report is clearly and skilfully drawn up, in an admi,
<lb/>rable spirit of humanity, and with an eye to impartial justice,
<lb/>and a wise economy, at the same time. We have been re-
<lb break="no"/>quested to make the following statement:</p><p></p><p>“ The Female Department of the New York Association,
<lb/>being about to establish a Home for the temporary reception
<lb/>of such discharged convicts as may appear willing to reform,
<lb/>earnestly solicit immediate aid from all those interested in
<lb/>this attempt, in the form of money, clothing, household fur-
<lb break="no"/> niture, fuel, books, or goods of any description,—in short
<lb/>everything; that can be used in a large and destitute family.</p><p>Caroline M. Kirkland, Cor. Sec'y.”
</p><p>Mr. Willis.—Nothig for a long time has given us so
<lb/>true a pleasure as to learn that this distinguished gentleman
<lb/>has entirely recovered his health. He is now busily at work
<lb/>—and has commenced his anxiously expected Letters for</p><p></p><p>The Mirror”—four of them having been already received.
<lb/>Among all our men of literature there is not one whose laur-
<lb break="no"/>els have been more nobly earned than have been those of
<lb/>Mr. Willis. The country has a right to be proud of him—
<lb/>and is.</p><p></p><p>It is extraordinary, says Mr. W. in one of his late letters,
<lb/>how little the English change ! Regent-street, after four or
<lb/>five years, is exactly what Regent-street was. The men
<lb/>have the same light cravats, coats too small, overbrushed
<lb/>whiskers, and look of being excessively washed. The car-
<lb break="no"/>riages and horses exactly the same. The cheap shops have
<lb/>the same placard of “ Selling Off” in their broad windows.
<lb/>The blind beggars tell the same story, and are led by the
<lb/>same dogs: but what is stranger than all this sameness is,
<lb/>that the ladies look the same ! The fashions have perhaps
<lb/>changed—in the milliner’s shops! But the Englishing that
<lb/>is done to French bonnets after they are bought, or the En
<lb/>glish way in which they are worn, overpowers the novelty,
<lb/>and gives the fair occupants of the splendid carriages of Lon-
<lb break="no"/>don the very same look they had ten years ago.</p><p></p><p>Still, there are some slight differences observable in the
<lb/>street, and among others, I observe that the economical pri-
<lb break="no"/>vate carriage called a “ Brougham,” is very common. These
<lb/>are low cabs, holding two or four persons, with a driver, and
<lb/>perhaps a footman in livery on the outside seat, and one
<lb/>horse seems to do the work as well as two. This fashion
<lb/>would be well introduced into New York—that is so say, if
<lb/>our city is ever to be well enough paved to make a drive any
<lb/>thing but a dire necessity. The paving of London is really
<lb/>most admirable. Vast city as it is, the streets are as smooth
<lb/>as a floor all over it, and to ride is indeed a luxury. The
<lb/>breack-neck, hat-jamming and dislocating jolts of Broadway
<lb/>must seem to English judgment an inexcusable stain on our
<lb/>public spirit. And, Apropos of paving—the wooden pave-
<lb break="no"/>ment seems to be entirely out of favor. Regent street is laid
<lb/>in wooden blocks, and in wet weather (and it rains here some
<lb/>part of every day,) it is so slippery that an omnibus which
<lb/>has been stopped in going up the street is with difficulty start-
<lb break="no"/>ed again. The horses almost always come to their knees,
<lb/>thongh the ascent is very slight, and the falls of cart and car-
<lb break="no"/>riage-horses are occurring continually. Nothing seems to</p><p>"do" like the McAdam pavement, and wherever you find it
in London, you find it in as perfect order as the floor of
<pb n="46"/>
</p><p>bowling-alley. I see that all heavy vehicles, (by the way)
<lb/>are compelled to have very broad wheels, and they rather
<lb/>improve the road than spoil it. A law to the same effect
<lb/>should be passed in New York, if it ever has a pavement
<lb/>worth preserving.</p><p></p><p>We are requested to call the attention of our readers to the

<lb/>poetical inspirations. Alexander Dumas is installed in the pret-

<lb/>cottage, formed of two purlieus, which overlook the brightest

GOLD PEN.
THIS PEN RECEIVED THE HIGHEST PRE-
</p><p>mium at the last Fair of the American Institute, and has been pro-
<lb break="no"/>nounced by the First Teachers of Penmanship in the country, to be
<lb/>infinitely superior to any Gold Pen ever before introduced to the Ame-
<lb break="no"/>rican public. The lasting properties of this Pen are undoubted, owing
<lb/>to the total absence of corrosibility from any of the inks in use; and the
<lb/>peculiar shape of the nibs—which was first introduced by Bagley—
<lb/>makes it more pleasant to use, renders it less liable to damage, more
<lb/>easy to repair, and prevents the necessity of the great care that other
<lb/>articles of the kind require.</p><p>MANUFACTORY, 189 BROADWAY, NEW YORK.

</p><p>This is the production of a young American, who had the rare for-

HISTORY OF
THE CONQUEST OF MEXICO.
WITH A LIFE OF THE CONQUERER, HERNANDO CORTES,

BY WILLIAM H. PRESCOTT, Esq.
</p><p>Mr. Prescott appears to possess almost every qualification for his

<lb/>valuable qualities which distinguish the most popular historical writers
<lb/>in our language of the present day. It unites the chivalrous but truth-

</p><p>THIS is the only thorough, complete and progressive work
<lb/>yet published in this country. Where pupils have used this me-
<lb break="no"/>thod, the most rapid advancement has been observed in all cases.
<lb/>The most prominent feature of this work is that the lessons, exerci-
<lb break="no"/>ses, scales and studies are given in such progressive order, that they
<lb/>enlist the interest of pupils, and carry them almost imperceptibly
<lb/>through those mechanical difficulties which, otherwise, are too often
<lb/>made irksome in other instruction books. The time has arrived when
<lb/>a superficial knowledge of the Piano is of but little account, and it is
<lb/>only by the study of such methods us Bertini’s that pupils will be ena-
<lb break="no"/>bled to read music with facility, and at the same time become good
<lb/>musicians.</p><p></p><p>This method commences in the most plain and simple manner ; the
<lb/>rudiments of music being given and illustrated at the same time, and
<lb/>each lesson is fully explained by marginal notes on the same page.</p><p></p><p>The publishers are in possession of the highest recommendations
<lb/>from professional gentlemen, who speak of the superior merits of
<lb/>Bertini’s Method over all others yet published in this country, most
<lb/>of them having used the foreign copies previously. It will only be
