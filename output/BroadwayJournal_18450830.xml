Slander,
A whisper woke the air—
A soft light tone and low,
Yet barbed with shame and woe ;—
Now, might it only perish there !
Nor farther go.
Ah me ! a quick and eager ear
Caught up the little meaning sound !
Another voice has breathed it clear,
And so it wanders round,
From ear to lip—from lip to ear—
Until it reached a gentle heart,
And that—it broke.
It was the only heart it found,
The only heart ’t was meant to find,
When first its accents woke;—
It reached that tender heart at last,
And that—it broke.
Low as it seemed to other ears,
It came—a thunder-crash to hers,—
That fragile girl so fair and gay,—
That guileless girl so pure and true !
’Tis said a lovely humming bird
That in a fragrant lily lay,
And dreamed the summer mom away.
Was killed by but the gun’s report,
Some idle boy had fired in sport!
The very sound—a death-blow came !
And thus her happy heart, that beat,
With love and hope, so fast and sweet,
</p><p>(Shrined in its Lily too
<lb/>For who the maid that knew
<lb/>But owned the delicate flower-like grace
<lb/>Of her young form and face ?)</p><p>When first that word
Her light heart heard,
It fluttered like the frightened bird.
Then shut its wings and sighed,
And, with a silent shudder,—died!
FRANCES S. OSGOOD.
William Wilson.
What say of it? what say conscience grim,
That spectre in my path ?
Chamberlain's Pharronida.
</p><p>Let me call myself, for the present, William Wilson. The
<lb/>fair page now lying before me need not be sullied with my
<lb/>real appellation. This has been already too much an object
<lb/>for the scorn—for the horror—for the detestation of my race.
<lb/>To the uttermost regions of the globe have not the indignant
<lb/>winds bruited its unparalleled infamy ? Oh, outcast of all
<lb/>outcasts most abandoned !—to the earth art thou not forever
<lb/>dead ? to its honors, to its flowers, to its golden aspirations?—</p><p>and a cloud, dense, dismal, and limitless, does it not hang
eternally between thy hopes and heaven ?
</p><p>I would not, if I could, here or to-day, embody a record
<lb/>of my later years of unspeakable misery, and unpardonable
<lb/>crime. This epoch—these later years—took unto them-
<lb break="no"/>selves a sudden elevation in turpitude, whose origin alone it
<lb/>is my present purpose to assign. Men usually grow base
<lb/>by degrees. From me, in an instant, all virtue dropped
<lb/>bodily as a mantle. From comparatively trivial wickedness
<lb/>I passed, with the stride of a giant, into more than the enor-
<lb break="no"/>mities of an Elah-Gabalus. What chance—what one event
<lb/>brought this evil thing to pass, bear with me while I relate.
<lb/>Death approaches; and the shadow which foreruns him has
<lb/>thrown a softening influence over my spirit. I long, in pass-
<lb break="no"/>ing through the dim valley, for the sympathy—I had nearly
<lb/>said for the pity—of my fellow men. I would fain have
<lb/>them believe that I have been, in some measure, the slave
<lb/>of circumstances beyond human control. I would wish them
<lb/>to seek out for me, in the details 1 am about to give, some
<lb/>little oasis of fatality amid a wilderness of error. I would
<lb/>have them allow—what they cannot refrain from allowing—
<lb/>that, although temptation may have erewhile existed as
<lb/>great, man was never thus, at least, tempted before—cer-
<lb break="no"/>tainly, never thus fell. And is it therefore that he has never
<lb/>thus suffered? Have I not indeed been living in a dream ?
<lb/>And am I not now dying a victim to the horror and the mys-
<lb break="no"/>tery of the wildest of all sublunary visions?</p><p></p><p>I am the descendant of a race whose imaginative and ea-
<lb break="no"/>sily excitable temperament has at all times rendered them
<lb/>remarkable; and, in my earliest infancy, I gave evidence of
<lb/>having fully inherited the family character. As 1 advanced
<lb/>iu years it was more strongly developed ; becoming, for many
<lb/>reasons, a cause of serious disquietude to my friends, and of
<lb/>positive injury to myself. I grew self-willed, addicted to the
<lb/>wildest caprices, and a prey to the most ungovernable pas-
<lb break="no"/>sions. Weak-minded, and beset with constitutional infirmi-
<lb break="no"/>ties akin to my own, my parents could do but little to check
<lb/>the evil propensities which distinguished me. Some feeble
<lb/>and ill-directed efforts resulted in complete failure on their
<lb/>part, and, of course, in total triumph on mine. Thencefor-
<lb break="no"/>ward my voice was a household law ; and at an age when
<lb/>few children have abandoned their leading-strings, I was
<lb/>left to the guidance of my own will, and became, in all but
<lb/>name, the master of my own actions.</p><p></p><p>My earliest recollections of a school-life, are connected
<lb/>with a large, rambling, Elizabethan house, in a misty-look-
<lb break="no"/>ing village of England, where were a vast number of gigan-
<lb break="no"/>tic and gnarled trees, and where all the houses were exces-
<lb break="no"/>sively ancient. In truth, it was a dream-like and spirit-
<lb break="no"/>soothing place, that venerable old town. At this moment,
<lb/>in fancy, I feel the refreshing chilliness of its deeply-shad-
<lb break="no"/>owed avenues, inhale the fragrance of its thousand shrub-
<lb break="no"/>beries, and thrill anew with undefinable delight, at the deep
<lb/>hollow note of the church-bell, breaking, each hour, with</p><p><pb n="114"/>
</p><p>sullen and sudden roar, upon the stillness of the dusky at-
<lb break="no"/>mosphere in which the fretted Gothic steeple lay imbedded
<lb/>and asleep.</p><p></p><p>It gives me, perhaps, as much of pleasure as I can now in
<lb/>any manner experience, to dwell upon minute recollections
<lb/>of the school and its concerns. Steeped in misery as I am—
<lb/>misery, alas! only too real—I shall be pardoned for seeking
<lb/>relief, however slight and temporary, in the weakness of a
<lb/>few rambling details. These, moreover, utterly trivial, and
<lb/>even ridiculous in themselves, assume, to my fancy, adven-
<lb break="no"/>titious importance, as connected with a period and a locality
<lb/>when and where I recognise the first ambiguous monitions
<lb/>of the destiny which afterwards so fully overshadowed me.
<lb/>Let me then remember.</p><p></p><p>The house, I have said, was old and irregular. The
<lb/>grounds were extensive, and a high and solid brick wall,
<lb/>topped with a bed of mortar and broken glass, encompassed
<lb/>the whole. This prison-like rampart formed the limit of our
<lb/>domain ; beyond it we saw but thrice a week — once every
<lb/>Saturday afternoon, when, attended by two ushers, we were
<lb/>permitted to take brief walks in a body through some of the
<lb/>neighbouring fields—and twice during Sunday, when we
<lb/>were paraded in the same formal manner to the morning and
<lb/>evening service in the one church of the village. Of this
<lb/>church the principal of our school was pastor. With how
<lb/>deep a spirit of wonder and perplexity was I wont to regard
<lb/>him from our remote pew in the gallery, as, with step sol-
<lb break="no"/>emn and slow, he ascended the pulpit! This reverend man,
<lb/>with countenance so demurely benign, with robes so glossy
<lb/>and so clerically flowing, with wig so minutely powdered,
<lb/>so rigid and so vast,—could this be he who, of late, with
<lb/>sour visage, and in snuffy habiliments, administered, ferule
<lb/>in hand, the Draconian laws of the academy ? Oh, gigantic
<lb/>paradox, too utterly monstrous for solution !</p><p></p><p>At an angle of the ponderous wall frowned a more pon-
<lb break="no"/>derous gate. It was riveted and studded with iron bolts, and
<lb/>surmounted with jagged iron spikes. What impressions of
<lb/>deep awe did it inspire! It was never opened save for the
<lb/>three periodical egressions and ingressions already mention-
<lb break="no"/>ed ; then, in every creak of its mighty hinges, we found a
<lb/>plenitude of mystery—a world of matter for solemn remark,
<lb/>or for more solemn meditation.</p><p></p><p>The extensive enclosure was irregular in form, having
<lb/>many capacious recesses. Of these, three or four of the
<lb/>largest constituted the play-ground. It was level, and cov-
<lb break="no"/>ered with fine hard gravel. I well remember it had no trees,
<lb/>nor benches, nor any thing similar within it. Of course it
<lb/>was in the rear of the house. In front lay a small parterre,
<lb/>planted with box and other shrubs; but through this sacred
<lb/>division we passed only upon rare occasions indeed—such as
<lb/>a first advent to school or final departure thence, or perhaps,
<lb/>when a parent or friend having called for us, we joyfully
<lb/>took our way home for the Christmas or Midsummer holy-
<lb break="no"/>days.</p><p></p><p>But the house! — how quaint an old building was this ! —
<lb/>to me how veritably a palace of enchantment! There was
<lb/>really no end to its windings — to its incomprehensible sub-
<lb break="no"/>divisions. It was difficult, at any given lime, to say with cer-
<lb break="no"/>tainty upon which of its two stories one happened to be.
<lb/>From each room to every other there were sure to be found
<lb/>three or four steps either in ascent or descent. Then the
<lb/>lateral branches were innumerable—inconceivable—and so
<lb/>returning in upon themselves, that our most exact ideas in
<lb/>regard to the whole mansion were not very far different from
<lb/>those with which we pondered upon infinity. During the
<lb/>five years of my residence here, I was never able to ascer</p><p></p><p>tain with precision, in what remote locality lay the little
<lb/>sleeping apartment assigned to myself and some eighteen or
<lb/>twenty other scholars.</p><p></p><p>The school-room was the largest in the house — I could
<lb/>not help thinking, in the world. It was very long, narrow,
<lb/>and dismally low, with pointed Gothic windows and a ceil-
<lb break="no"/>ing of oak. In a remote and terror-inspiring angle was a
<lb/>square enclosure of eight or ten feet, comprising the sanctum,
<lb/>“ during hours,” of our principal, the Reverend Dr. Bransby.
<lb/>It was a solid structure, with massy door, sooner than open
<lb/>which in the absence of the “ Dominie,” we would all have
<lb/>willingly perished by the peine forte et dure. In other an-
<lb break="no"/>gles were two other similar boxes, far less reverenced, in-
<lb break="no"/>deed, but still greatly matters of awe. One of these was
<lb/>the pulpit of the “ classical ” usher, one of the “ English
<lb/>and mathematical.” Interspersed about the room, crossing
<lb/>and re-crossing in endless irregularity, were innumerable
<lb/>benches and desks, black, ancient, and time-worn, piled des-
<lb break="no"/>perately with much-bethumbed books, and so beseamed
<lb/>with initial letters, names at full length, grotesque figures,
<lb/>and other multiplied efforts of the knife, as to have entirely
<lb/>lost what little of original form might have been their por-
<lb break="no"/>tion in days long departed. A huge bucket with water stood
<lb/>at one extremity of the room, and a clock of stupendous di-
<lb break="no"/>mensions at the other.</p><p></p><p>Encompassed by the massy walls of this venerable acad-
<lb break="no"/>emy, I passed, yet not in tedium or disgust, the years of the
<lb/>third lustrum of my life. The teeming brain of childhood
<lb/>requires no external world of incident to occupy or amuse it;
<lb/>and the apparently dismal monotony of a school was replete
<lb/>with more intense excitement than my riper youth has de-
<lb break="no"/>rived from luxury, or my full manhood from crime. Yet I
<lb/>must believe that my first mental development had in it
<lb/>much of the uncommon — even much of the outré. Upon
<lb/>mankind at large the events of very early existence rarely
<lb/>leave in mature age any definite impression. All is gray
<lb/>shadow—a weak and irregular remembrance—an indistinct
<lb/>regathering of feeble pleasures and phantasmagoric pains.
<lb/>With me this is not so. In childhood I must have felt with
<lb/>the energy of a man what I now find stamped upon memory
<lb/>in lines as vivid, as deep, and as durable as the exergues of
<lb/>the Carthaginian medals.</p><p></p><p>Yet in fact — in the fact of the world’s view — how little
<lb/>was there to remember! The morning’s awakening, the
<lb/>nightly summons to bed; the connings, the recitations ; the
<lb/>periodical half-holidays, and perambulations; the play-
<lb break="no"/>ground, with its broils, its pastimes, its intrigues ; — these,
<lb/>by a mental sorcery long forgotten, were made to involve a
<lb/>wilderness of sensation, a world of rich incident, an universe
<lb/>of varied emotion, of excitement the most passionate and
<lb/>spirit-stirring. “ Oh, le bon temps, que ce siecle de fer !"</p><p></p><p>In truth, the ardor, the enthusiasm, and the imperiousness
<lb/>of my disposition, soon rendered me a marked character
<lb/>among my schoolmates, and by slow, but natural gradations,
<lb/>gave me an ascendancy over all not greatly older than my-
<lb break="no"/>self;—over all with a single exception. This exception was
<lb/>found in the person of a scholar, who, although no relation,
<lb/>bore the same Christian and surname as myself;—a circum-
<lb break="no"/>stance, in fact, little remarkable; for, notwithstanding a no-
<lb break="no"/>ble descent, mine was one of those every-day appellations
<lb/>which seem, by prescriptive right, to have been, time out of
<lb/>mind, the common property of the mob. In this narrative I
<lb/>have therefore designated myself as William Wilson,—a fic-
<lb break="no"/>titious title not very dissimilar to the real. My namesake
<lb/>alone, of those who in school phraseology constituted “ our
<lb/>set," presumed to compete with me in the studies of the</p><p><pb n="115"/>
</p><p>class—in the sports and broils of the play-ground—to refuse
<lb/>implicit belief in my assertions, and submission to my will—
<lb/>indeed, to interfere with my arbitrary dictation in any res-
<lb break="no"/>pect whatsoever. If there is on earth a supreme and un-
<lb break="no"/>qualified despotism, it is the despotism of a master mind in
<lb/>boyhood over the less energetic spirits of its companions.</p><p></p><p>Wilson’s rebellion was to me a source of the greatest em-
<lb break="no"/>barrassment ;—the more so as, in spite of the bravado with
<lb/>which in public I made a point of treating him and his pre-
<lb break="no"/>tensions, I secretly felt that I feared him, and could not help
<lb/>thinking the equality which he maintained so easily with
<lb/>myself, a proof of his true superiority ; since not to be over-
<lb break="no"/>come cost me a perpetual struggle. Yet this superiority—even
<lb/>this equality—was in truth acknowledged by no one but my-
<lb break="no"/>self; our associates, by some unaccountable blindness, seem-
<lb break="no"/>ed not even to suspect it. Indeed, his competition, his resis-
<lb break="no"/>tance, and especially his impertinent and dogged interference
<lb/>with my purposes, were not more pointed than private. He
<lb/>appeared to be destitute alike of the ambition which urged,
<lb/>and of the passionate energy of mind which enabled me to
<lb/>excel. In his rivalry he might have been supposed actuated
<lb/>solely by a whimsical desire to thwart, astonish, or mortify
<lb/>myself; although there were times when I could not help
<lb/>observing, with a feeling made up of wonder, abasement,
<lb/>and pique, that he mingled with his injuries, his insults, or
<lb/>his contradictions, a certain most inappropriate, and assured-
<lb break="no"/>ly most unwelcome affectionateness of manner. I could on-
<lb break="no"/>ly conceive this singular behavior to arise from a consum-
<lb break="no"/>mate self-conceit assuming the vulgar airs of patronage and
<lb/>protection.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps it was this latter trait in Wilson’s conduct, con-
<lb break="no"/>joined with our identity of name, and the mere accident of
<lb/>our having entered the school upon the same day, which set
<lb/>afloat the notion that we were brothers, among the senior
<lb/>classes in the academy. These do not usually inquire with
<lb/>much strictness into the affairs of their juniors. I have be-
<lb break="no"/>fore said, or should have said, that Wilson was not, in the
<lb/>most remote degree, connected with my family. But assur-
<lb break="no"/>edly if we had been brothers we must have been twins ; for,
<lb/>after leaving Dr. Bransby’s, I casually learned that my name-
<lb break="no"/>sake was born on the nineteenth of January, 1813—and this
<lb/>is a somewhat remarkable coincidence; for the day is pre-
<lb break="no"/>cisely that of my own nativity.</p><p></p><p>It may seem strange that in spite of the continual anxiety
<lb/>occasioned me by the rivalry of Wilson, and his intolerable
<lb/>spirit of contradiction, I could not bring myself to hate him
<lb/>altogether. We had, to be sure, nearly every day a quarrel
<lb/>in which, yielding me publicly the palm of victory, he, in
<lb/>some manner, contrived to make me feel that it was he who
<lb/>had deserved it; yet a sense of pride on my part, and a ver-
<lb break="no"/>itable dignity on his own, kept us always upon what are
<lb/>called “ speaking terms,” while there were many points of
<lb/>strong congeniality in our tempers, operating to awake in me
<lb/>a sentiment which our position alone, perhaps, prevented
<lb/>from ripening into friendship. It is difficult, indeed, to de-
<lb break="no"/>fine, or even to describe, my real feelings towards him.
<lb/>They formed a motley and heterogeneous admixture;—some
<lb/>petulant animosity, which was not yet hatred, some esteem, 
<lb/>more respect, much fear, with a world of uneasy curiosity, 
<lb/>To the moralist it will be unnecessary to say, in addition, 
<lb/>that Wilson and myself were the most inseparable of com-
<lb break="no"/>panions.</p><p></p><p>It was no doubt the anomalous state of affairs existing be-
<lb break="no"/>tween us, which turned all my attacks upon him, (and they 
<lb/>were many, eitlter open or covert) into the channel of banter
<lb/>or practical joke (giving pain while assuming the aspect of</p><p></p><p>mere fun) rather than into a more serious and determined
<lb/>hostility. But my endeavours on this head were by no means
<lb/>uniformly successful, even when my plans were the most
<lb/>wittily concocted ; for my namesake had much about him,
<lb/>in character, of that unassuming aDd quiet austerity which,
<lb/>while enjoying the poignancy of its own jokes, has no heel
<lb/> of Achilles in itself, and absolutely refuses to be laughed at.
<lb/>I could find, indeed, but one vulnerable point, and that, ly-
<lb break="no"/>ing in a personal peculiarity, arising, perhaps, from constitu-
<lb break="no"/>tional disease, would have been spared by any antagonist
<lb/>less at his wit’s end than myself;—my rival had a weakness
<lb/>in the faucial or guttural organs, which precluded him from
<lb/>raising his voice at any time above a very low whisper. Of
<lb/>this defect I did not fail to take what poor advantage lay in
<lb/>my power.</p><p></p><p>Wilson’s retaliations in kind were many ; and there was
<lb/>one form of his practical wit that disturbed me beyond mea-
<lb break="no"/>sure. How his sagacity first discovered at all that so petty
<lb/>a thing would vex me, is a question I never could solve;
<lb/>but, having discovered, he habitually practised the annoy-
<lb break="no"/>ance. I had always felt aversion to my uncourtly patrony-
<lb break="no"/>mic, and its very common, if not plebeian prӕnomen. The
<lb/>words were venom in my ears; and when, upon the day of
<lb/>my arrival, a second William Wilson came also to the acad-
<lb break="no"/>emy, I felt angry with him for bearing the name, and doubly
<lb/>disgusted with the name because a stranger bore it, who
<lb/>would be the cause of its twofold repetition, who would be
<lb/>constantly in my presence, and whose concerns, in the ordi-
<lb break="no"/>nary routine of the school business, must inevitably, on ac-
<lb break="no"/>count of the detestable coincidence, be often confounded with
<lb/>my own.</p><p></p><p>The feeling of vexation thus engendered grew stronger
<lb/>with every circumstance tending to show resemblance, mor-
<lb break="no"/>al or physical, between my rival and myself. I had not then
<lb/>discovered the remarkable fact that we were of the same
<lb/>age; but I saw that we were of the same height, and I per-
<lb break="no"/>ceived that we were even singularly alike in general con-
<lb break="no"/>tour of person and outline of feature. I was galled, too, by
<lb/>the rumor touching a relationship, which had grown current
<lb/>in the upper forms. In a word, nothing could more serious-
<lb break="no"/>ly disturb me, (although I scrupulously concealed such dis-
<lb break="no"/>turbance,) than any allusion to a similarity of mind, person,
<lb/>or condition existing between us. But, in truth, I had no
<lb/>reason to believe that (with the exception of the matter of
<lb/>relationship, and in the case of Wilson himself,) this simi-
<lb break="no"/>larity had ever been made a subject of comment, or even ob-
<lb break="no"/>served at all by our schoolfellows. That he observed it in
<lb/>all its bearings, and as fixedly as I, was apparent; but that
<lb/>he could discover in such circumstances so fruitful a field of
<lb/>annoyance, can only be attributed, as I said before, to his
<lb/>more than ordinary penetration.</p><p></p><p>His cue, which was to perfect an imitation of myself, lay
<lb/>both in words and in actions; and most admirably did he
<lb/>play his part. My dress it was an easy matter to copy ; my
<lb/>gait and general manner were, without difficulty, appropri-
<lb break="no"/>ated ; in spite of his constitutional defect, even my voice did
<lb/>not escape him. My louder tones were, of course, unat-
<lb break="no"/>tempted, but then the key, it was identical; and his singular
<lb/>whisper, it grew the very echo of my own.</p><p></p><p>How greatly this most exquisite portraiture harassed me,
<lb/>(for it could not justly be termed a caricature,) I will not
<lb/>now venture to describe. I had but one consolation—in the
<lb/>fact that the imitation, apparently, was noticed by myself
<lb/>alone, and that I had to endure only the knowing and
<lb/>strangely sarcastic smiles of my namesake himself. Satis-
<lb break="no"/>fied with having produced in my bosom the intended effect,
<lb/>be seemed to chuckle in secret over the sting he had inflict</p><p><pb n="116"/>
</p><p>ed, and was characteristically disregardful of the public ap-
<lb break="no"/>plause which the success of his witty endeavours might have
<lb/>so easily elicited. That the school, indeed, did not feel his
<lb/>design, perceive its accomplishment, and participate in his
<lb/>sneer, was, for many anxious months, a riddle I could not re-
<lb break="no"/>solve. Perhaps the gradation of his copy rendered it not
<lb/>so readily perceptible; or, more possibly, I owed my secur-
<lb break="no"/>ity to the masterly air of the copyist, who, disdaining the
<lb/>letter, (which in a painting is all the obtuse can see,) gave
<lb/>but the full spirit of his original for my individual contem-
<lb break="no"/>plation and chagrin.</p><p></p><p>I have already more than once spoken of the disgusting
<lb/>air of patronage which he assumed toward me, and of his
<lb/>frequent officious interference with my will. This interfer-
<lb break="no"/>ence often took the ungracious character of advice; advice
<lb/>not openly given, but hinted or insinuated. I received it
<lb/>with a repugnance which gained strength as I grew in years.
<lb/>Yet, at this distant day, let me do him the simple justice to
<lb/>acknowledge that I can recall no occasion when the sugges-
<lb break="no"/>tions of my rival were on the side of those errors or follies
<lb/>so usual to his immature age and seeming inexperience; that
<lb/>his moral sense, at least, if not his general talents and world-
<lb break="no"/>ly wisdom, was far keener than my own; and that I might,
<lb/>to-day, have been a better, and thus a happier man, had I
<lb/>less frequently rejected the counsels embodied in those mean-
<lb break="no"/>ing whispers which I then but too cordially hated and too
<lb/>bitterly despised.</p><p></p><p>As it was, I at length grew restive in the extreme under
<lb/>his distasteful supervision, and daily resented more and more
<lb/>openly what I considered his intolerable arrogance. I have
<lb/>said that, in the first years of our connexion as schoolmates,
<lb/>my feelings in regard to him might have been easily ripened
<lb/>into friendship ; but, in the latter months of my residence at
<lb/>the academy, although the intrusion of his ordinary manner
<lb/>had, beyond doubt, in some measure, abated, my sentiments,
<lb/>in nearly similar proportion, partook very much of positive
<lb/>hatred. Upon one occasion he saw this, I think, and after-
<lb break="no"/>wards avoided, or made a show of avoiding me.</p><p></p><p>It was about the same period, if I remember aright, that,
<lb/>in an altercation of violence with him, in which he was more
<lb/>than usually thrown off his guard, and spoke and acted with
<lb/>an openness of demeanor rather foreign to his nature, I dis-
<lb break="no"/>covered, or fancied I discovered, in his accent, his air, and
<lb/>general appearance, a something which first startled, and
<lb/>then deeply interested me, by bringing to mind dim visions
<lb/>of my earliest infancy—wild, confused and thronging mem-
<lb break="no"/>ories of a time when memory herself was yet unborn. I
<lb/>cannot better describe the sensation which oppressed me
<lb/>than by saying that I could with difficulty shake off the be-
<lb break="no"/>lief of my having been acquainted with the being who stood
<lb/>before me, at some epoch very long ago—some point of the
<lb/>past even infinitely remote. The delusion, however, faded
<lb/>rapidly as it came; and I mention it at all but to define the
<lb/>day of the last conversation I there held with my singular 
<lb/>namesake.</p><p></p><p>The huge old house, with its countless subdivisions, had
<lb/>several large chambers communicating with each other,
<lb/>where slept the greater number of the students. There
<lb/>were, however, (as must necessarily happen in a building so
<lb/>awkwardly planned,) many little nooks or recesses, the odds
<lb/>and ends of the structure ; and these the economic ingenu-
<lb break="no"/>ity of Dr. Bransby had also fitted up as dormitories ; although,
<lb/>being the merest closets, they were capable of accommodat-
<lb break="no"/>ing but a single individual. One of these small apartments
<lb/>was occupied by Wilson.</p><p>One night, about the close of my fifth year at the school,
</p><p>and immediately after the altercation just mentioned, find-
<lb break="no"/>ing every one wrapped in sleep, I arose from bed, and, lamp
<lb/>in hand, stole through a wilderness of narrow passages from
<lb/>my own bedroom to that of my rival. I had long been plot-
<lb break="no"/>ting one of those ill-natured pieces of practical wit at his
<lb/>expense in which I had hitherto been so uniformly unsuc-
<lb break="no"/>cessful. It was my intention, now, to put my scheme in op-
<lb break="no"/>eration, and I resolved to make him feel the whole extent
<lb/>of the malice with which I was imbued. Having reached
<lb/>his closet, I noiselessly entered, leaving the lamp, with a
<lb/>shade over it, on the outside. I advanced a step, and listen-
<lb break="no"/>ed to the sound of his tranquil breathing. Assured of his
<lb/>being asleep, I returned, took the light, and with it again
<lb/>approached the bed. Close curtains were around it, which,
<lb/>in the prosecution of my plan, I slowly and quietly with-
<lb break="no"/>drew, when the bright rays fell vividly upon the sleeper,
<lb/>and my eyes, at the same moment, upon his countenance.
<lb/>I looked ; — and a numbness, an iciness of feeling instantly
<lb/>pervaded my frame. My breast heaved, my knees tottered,
<lb/>my whole spirit became possessed with an objectless yet in-
<lb break="no"/>tolerable horror. Gasping for breath, I lowered the lamp
<lb/>in still nearer proximity to the face. Were these—these the
<lb/>lineaments of William Wilson ? I saw, indeed, that they
<lb/>were his, but I shook as if with a fit of the ague in fancying
<lb/>they were not. What was there about them to confound me
<lb/>in this manner ? I gazed ; — while my brain reeled with a
<lb/>multitude of incoherent thoughts. Not thus he appeared—
<lb/>assuredly not thus — in the vivacity of his waking hours.
<lb/>The same name ! the same contour of person ! the same day
<lb/>of arrival at the academy ! And then his dogged and mean-
<lb break="no"/>ingless imitation of my gait, my voice, my habits, and my
<lb/>manner ! Was it, in truth, within the bounds of human
<lb/>possibility, that what I now saw was the result, merely, of
<lb/>the habitual practice of this sarcastic imitation ? Awe-
<lb break="no"/>stricken, and with a creeping shudder, I extinguished the
<lb/>lamp, passed silently from the chamber, and left, at once, the
<lb/>halls of that old academy, never to enter them again.</p><p></p><p>After a lapse of some months, spent at home in mere idle-
<lb break="no"/>ness, I found myself a student at Eton. The brief interval
<lb/>had been sufficient to enfeeble my remembrance of the events
<lb/>at Dr. Bransby’s, or at least to effect a material change in
<lb/>the nature of the feelings with which I remembered them.
<lb/>The truth — the tragedy — of the drama was no more. I
<lb/>could now find room to doubt the evidence of my senses;
<lb/>and seldom called up the subject at all but with wonder at
<lb/>the extent of human credulity, and a smile at the vivid force
<lb/>of the imagination which I hereditarily possessed. Neither
<lb/>was this species of skepticism likely to be diminished by the
<lb/>character of the life I led at Eton. The vortex of thought-
<lb break="no"/>less folly into which I there so immediately and so recklessly
<lb/>plunged, washed away all but the froth of my past hours,
<lb/>engulfed at once every solid or serious impression, and left
<lb/>to memory only the veriest levities of a former existence.</p><p></p><p>I do not wish, however, to trace the course of my misera-
<lb break="no"/>ble profligacy here—a profligacy which set at defiance the
<lb/>laws, while it eluded the vigilance of the institution. Three
<lb/>years of folly, passed without profit, had but given me root-
<lb break="no"/>ed habits of vice, and added, in a somewhat unusual degree,
<lb/>to my bodily stature, when, after a week of soulless dissipa-
<lb break="no"/>tion, I invited a small party of the most dissolute students
<lb/>to a secret carousal in my chambers. We met at a late hour
<lb/>of the night; for our debaucheries were to be faithfully pro-
<lb break="no"/>tracted until morning. The wine flowed freely, and there
<lb/>were not wanting other and perhaps more dangerous seduc-
<lb break="no"/>tions; so that the grey dawn had already faintly appeared
<lb/>in the east, while our delirious extravagance was at its</p><p><pb n="117"/>
</p><p>height. Madly flashed with cards and intoxication, I was
<lb/>in the act of insisting upon a toast of more than wonted
<lb/>profanity, when my attention was suddenly diverted by the
<lb/>violent, although partial unclosing of the door of the apart-
<lb break="no"/>ment, and by the eager voice of a servant from without. He 
<lb/>said that some person, apparently in great haste, demanded
<lb/>to speak with me in the hall.</p><p></p><p>Wildly excited with wine, the unexpected interruption
<lb/>rather delighted than surprised me. I staggered forward at
<lb/>once, and a few steps brought me to the vestibule of the
<lb/>building. In this low and small room there hung no lamp;
<lb/>and now no light at all was admitted, save that of the ex-
<lb break="no"/>ceedingly feeble dawn which made its way through the 
<lb/>semi-circular window. As I put my foot over the threshold,</p><p></p><p>I became aware of the figure of a youth about my own
<lb/>height, and habited in a white kerseymere morning frock, cut
<lb/>in the novel fashion of the one I myself wore at the mo-
<lb break="no"/>ment. This the faint light enabled me to perceive ; but the
<lb/>features of his face I could not distinguish. Upon my en-
<lb break="no"/>tering he strode hurriedly up to me, and, seizing me by the
<lb/>arm with a gesture of petulant impatience, whispered the
<lb/>words “ William Wilson ! ” in my ear.</p><p>I grew perfectly sober in an instant.
</p><p>There was that in the manner of the stranger, and in the
<lb/>tremulous shake of his uplifted finger, as he held it between
<lb/>my eyes and the light, which filled me with unqualified
<lb/>amazement; but it was not this which had so violently
<lb/>moved me. It was the pregnancy of solemn admonition in
<lb/>the singular, low, hissing utterance ; and, above all, it was
<lb/>the character, the tone, the key, of those few, simple, and
<lb/>familiar, yet whispered syllables, which came with a thou-
<lb break="no"/>sand thronging memories of by-gone days, and struck upon
<lb/>my soul with the shock of a galvanic battery. Ere I could
<lb/>recover the use of my senses he was gone.</p><p></p><p>Although this event failed not of a vivid effect upon my 
<lb/>disordered imagination, yet was it evanescent as vivid. For
<lb/>some weeks, indeed, I busied myself in earnest inquiry, or
<lb/>was wrapped in a cloud of morbid speculation. I did not
<lb/>pretend to disguise from my perception the identity of the
<lb/>singular individual who thus perseveringly interfered with
<lb/>my affairs, and harassed me with his insinuated counsel.
<lb/>But who and what was this Wilson ? — and whence came
<lb/>he ?—and what were his purposes ? Upon neither of these
<lb/>points could I be satisfied ; merely ascertaining, in regard to
<lb/>him, that a sudden accident in his family had caused his re-
<lb break="no"/>moval from Dr. Bransby’s academy on the afternoon of the
<lb/>day in which I myself had eloped. But in a brief period I
<lb/>ceased to think upon the subject; my attention being all ab-
<lb break="no"/>sorbed in a contemplated departure for Oxford. Thither I
<lb/>soon went; the uncalculating vanity of my parents furnish-
<lb break="no"/>ng me with an outfit, and annual establishment, which
<lb/>Would enable me to indulge at will in the luxury already so
<lb/>dear to my heart,—to vie in profuseness of expenditure with
<lb/>the haughtiest heirs of the wealthiest earldoms in Great
<lb/>Britain.</p><p></p><p>Excited by such appliances to vice, my constitutional tem-
<lb break="no"/>perament broke forth with redoubled ardor, and I spurned
<lb/>even the common restraints of decency in the mad infatua-
<lb break="no"/>tion of my revels. But it were absurd to pause in the detail
<lb/>of my extravagance. Let it suffice, that among spendthrifts
<lb/>I out-Heroded Herod, and that, giving name to a multitude
<lb/>of novel follies, I added no brief appendix to the long cata-
<lb break="no"/>logue of vices then usual in the most dissolute university of
<lb/>Europe.</p><p>It could hardly be credited, however, that I had, even
here, so utterly fallen from the gentlemanly estate, as to 
</p><p>seek acquaintance with the vilest arts of the gambler by
<lb/>profession, and, having become an adept in his despicable
<lb/> science, to practise it habitually as a means of increasing
<lb/> my already enormous income at the expense of the weak-
<lb break="no"/> minded among my fellow collegians. Such, nevertheless,
<lb/>was the fact. And the very enormity of this offence against
<lb/>all manly and honourable sentiment proved, beyond doubt,
<lb/>the main if not the sole reason of the impunity with which
<lb/>it was committed. Who, indeed, among my most abandon-
<lb break="no"/>ed associates, would not rather have disputed the clearest
<lb/>evidence of his senses, than have suspected of such courses,
<lb/>the gay, the frank, the generous William Wilson — the no-
<lb break="no"/> blest and most liberal commoner at Oxford—him whose fol-
<lb break="no"/>lies (said his parasites) were but the follies of youth and
<lb/>unbridled fancy—whose errors but inimitable whim—whose
<lb/>darkest vice but a careless and dashing extravagance?</p><p></p><p>I had been now two years successfully busied in this way,
<lb/>when there came to the university a young parvenu noble-
<lb break="no"/>man, Glendinning — rich, said report, as Herodes Atticus —
<lb/>his riches, too, as easily acquired. I soon found him of weak
<lb/>intellect, and, of course, marked him as a fitting subject for
<lb/>my skill. I frequently engaged him in play, and contrived,
<lb/>with a gambler’s usual art, to let him win considerable sums,
<lb/>the more effectually to entangle him in my snares. At length,
<lb/>my schemes being ripe, I met him (with the full intention
<lb/>that this meeting should be final and decisive) at the cham-
<lb break="no"/>bers of a fellow-commoner, (Mr. Preston,) equally intimate
<lb/>with both, but who, to do him justice, entertained not even
<lb/>a remote suspicion of my design. To give to this a better
<lb/>coloring, I had contrived to have assembled a party of some
<lb/>eight or ten, and was solicitously careful that the introduc-
<lb break="no"/>tion of cards should appear accidental, and originate in the
<lb/>proposal of my contemplated dupe himself. To be brief
<lb/>upon a vile topic, none of the low finesse was omitted, so
<lb/>customary upon similar occasions that it is a just matter for
<lb/>wonder how any are still found so besotted as to fall its vic-
<lb break="no"/>tim.</p><p></p><p>We had protracted our sitting far into the night, and I had
<lb/>at length effected the manoeuvre of getting Glendinning as
<lb/>my sole antagonist. The game, too, was my favorite écarté.
<lb/>The rest of the company, interested in the extent of our
<lb/>play, had abandoned their own cards, and were standing
<lb/>around us as spectators. The parvenu, who had been in-
<lb break="no"/>duced by my artifices in the early part of the evening, to
<lb/>drink deeply, now shuffled, dealt, or played, with a wild
<lb/>nervousness of manner for which his intoxication, I thought,
<lb/>might partially, but could not altogether account. In a very
<lb/>short period be had become my debtor to a large amount,
<lb/>when, having taken a long draught of port, he did precisely
<lb/>what I had been coolly anticipating—he proposed to double
<lb/>our already extravagant stakes. With a well-feigned show
<lb/>of reluctance, and not until after my repeated refusal had
<lb/>seduced him into some angry words which gave a color of
<lb/>pique to my compliance, did I finally comply. The result,
<lb/>of course, did but prove how entirely the prey was in my
<lb/>toils ; in less than an hour he had quadrupled his debt. For
<lb/>some time his countenance had been losing the florid tinge
<lb/>lent it by the wine; but now, to my astonishment, I per-
<lb break="no"/>ceived that it had grown to a pallor truly fearful. I say to
<lb/>my astonishment. Glendinning had been represented to my
<lb/>eager inquiries as immeasurably wealthy; and the sums
<lb/>which he had as yet lost, although in themselves vast, could
<lb/>not, I supposed, very seriously annoy, much less so violently
<lb/>affect him. That he was overcome by the wine just swal-
<lb break="no"/>lowed, was the idea which most readily presented itself;
<lb/>and, rather with a view to the preservation of my own char-</p><p><pb n="118" break="no" />
</p><p>acter in the eyes of my associates, than from any less inter-
<lb break="no"/>ested motive, I was about to insist, peremptorily, upon a
<lb/>discontinuance of the play, when some expressions at my
<lb/>elbow from among the company, and an ejaculation evincing
<lb/>utter despair on the part of Glendinning, gave me to under-
<lb break="no"/>stand that I had effected his total ruin under circumstances
<lb/>which, rendering him an object for the pity of all, should
<lb/>have protected him from the ill offices even of a fiend.</p><p></p><p>What now might have been my conduct it is difficult to
<lb/>say. The pitiable condition of my dupe had thrown an air
<lb/>of embarrassed gloom over all; and, for some moments, a
<lb/>profound silence was maintained, during which I could not
<lb/>help feeling my cheeks tingle with the many burning glances
<lb/>of scorn or reproach cast upon me by the less abandoned of
<lb/>the party. I will even own that an intolerable weight of
<lb/>anxiety was for a brief instant lifted from my bosom by the
<lb/>sudden and extraordinary interruption which ensued. The
<lb/>wide, heavy folding doors of the apartment were all at once
<lb/>thrown open, to their full extent, with a vigorous and rush-
<lb break="no"/>ing impetuosity that extinguished, as if by magic, every
<lb/>candle in the room. Their light, in dying, enabled us just
<lb/>to perceive that a stranger had entered, about my own height,
<lb/>and closely muffled in a cloak. The darkness, however,
<lb/>was now total; and we could only feel that he was standing
<lb/>in our midst. Before any one of us could recover from the
<lb/>extreme astonishment into which this rudeness had thrown
<lb/>all, we heard the voice of the intruder.</p><p></p><p>“ Gentlemen,” he said, in a low, distinct, and never-to-be-
<lb break="no"/>forgotten whisper which thrilled to the very marrow of my
<lb/>bones, “ Gentlemen, I make no apology for this behaviour,
<lb/>because in thus behaving, I am but fulfilling a duty. You
<lb/>are, beyond doubt, uninformed of the true character of the
<lb/>person who has to-night won at écarté a large sum of mo-
<lb break="no"/>ney from Lord Glendinning. I will therefore put you upon
<lb/>an expeditious and decisive plan of obtaining this very ne-
<lb break="no"/>cessary information. Please to examine, at your leisure, the
<lb/>inner linings of the cuff of his left sleeve, and the several
<lb/>little packages which may be found in the somewhat capa-
<lb break="no"/>cious pockets of his embroidered morning wrapper.”</p><p></p><p>While he spoke, so profound was the stillness that one
<lb/>might have heard a pin drop upon the floor. In ceasing, he
<lb/>departed at once, and as abruptly as he had entered. Can
<lb/>I—shall I describe my sensations? — must I say that I felt
<lb/>all the horrors of the damned? Most assuredly I had little
<lb/>time given for reflection. Many hands roughly seized me
<lb/>upon the spot, and lights were immediately reprocured. A
<lb/>search ensued. In the lining of my sleeve were found all
<lb/>the court cards essential in écarté, and, in the pockets of my
<lb/>wrapper, a number of packs, fac-similes of those used at
<lb/>our sittings, with the single exception that mine were of the
<lb/>species called, technically, arrondées ; the honors being
<lb/>slightly convex at the ends, the lower cards slightly convex
<lb/>at the sides. In this disposition, the dupe who cuts, as cus-
<lb break="no"/>tomary, at the length of the pack, will invariably find that
<lb/>he cuts his antagonist an honor; while the gambler, cutting
<lb/>at the breadth, will, as certainly, cut nothing for his victim
<lb/>which may count in the records of the game.</p><p></p><p>Any burst of indignation upon this discovery would have
<lb/>affected me less than the silent contempt, or the sarcastic
<lb/>composure, with which it was received.</p><p></p><p>“Mr. Wilson,” said our host, stooping to remove from be-
<lb break="no"/>neath his feet an exceedingly luxurious cloak of rare furs,
<lb/>“Mr. Wilson, this is your property." (The weather was
<lb/>cold; and, upon quitting my own room, I had thrown a
<lb/>cloak over my dressing wrapper, putting it off upon readi-
<lb break="no"/>ng the scene of play.) “ I presume it is supererogatory to</p><p></p><p> seek here (eyeing the folds of the garment with a bitter
<lb/> smile) for any farther evidence of your skill. Indeed, we
<lb/>have had enough. You will see the necessity, I hope, of
<lb/>quitting Oxford — at all events, of quitting instantly my
<lb/>chambers.”</p><p></p><p>Abased, humbled to the dust as I then was, it is probable
<lb/>that I should have resented this galling language by imme-
<lb break="no"/>diate personal violence, had not my whole attention been
<lb/>at the moment arrested by a fact of the most startling char-
<lb break="no"/>acter. The cloak which I had worn was of a rare descrip-
<lb break="no"/>tion of fur; how rare, how extravagantly costly, I shall not
<lb/>venture to say. Its fashion, too, was of my own fantastic
<lb/>invention ; for I was fastidious to an absurd degree of cox-
<lb break="no"/>combry, in matters of this frivolous nature. When, there-
<lb break="no"/>fore, Mr. Preston reached me that which he had picked up
<lb/>upon the floor, and near the folding doors of the apartment,
<lb/>it was with an astonishment nearly bordering upon terror,
<lb/>that I perceived my own already hanging on my arm, (where
<lb/>I had no doubt unwittingly placed it,) and that the one pre-
<lb break="no"/>sented me was but its exact counterpart in every, in even
<lb/>the minutest possible particular. The singular being who
<lb/>had so disastrously exposed me, had been muffled, I remem-
<lb break="no"/>bered, in a cloak; and none had been worn at all by any of
<lb/>the members of our party with the exception of myself.
<lb/>Retaining some presence of mind, I took the one offered me
<lb/>by Preston; placed it, unnoticed, over my own; left the apart-
<lb break="no"/>ment with a resolute scowl of defiance; and, next morning
<lb/>ere dawn of day, commenced a hurried journey from Ox-
<lb break="no"/>ford to the continent, in a perfect agony of horror and of
<lb/>shame.</p><p></p><p>I fled in vain. My evil destiny pursued me as if in exul-
<lb break="no"/>tation, and proved, indeed, that the exercise of its mysterious
<lb/>dominion had as yet only begun. Scarcely had I set foot in
<lb/>Paris ere I had fresh evidence of the detestable interest tak-
<lb break="no"/>en by this Wilson in my concerns. Years flew, while I ex-
<lb break="no"/>perienced no relief. Villain !—at Rome, with how untime-
<lb break="no"/>ly, yet with how spectral an officiousness, stepped he in be-
<lb break="no"/>tween me and my ambition ! At Vienna, too—at Berlin—
<lb/>and at Moscow! Where, in truth, had I not bitter cause to
<lb/>curse him within my heart ? From his inscrutable tyranny
<lb/>did I at length flee, panic-stricken, as from a pestilence;
<lb/>and to the very ends of the earth I fled in vain.</p><p></p><p>And again, and again, in secret communion with my own
<lb/>spirit, would I demand the questions “Who is he?—
<lb/>whence came he ?—and what are his objects ?" But no an-
<lb break="no"/>swer was there found. And now I scrutinized, with a min-
<lb break="no"/>ute scrutiny, the forms, and the methods, and the leading traits
<lb/>of his impertinent supervision. But even here there was
<lb/>very little upon which to base a conjecture. It was noticea-
<lb break="no"/>ble, indeed, that, in no one of the multiplied instances in
<lb/>which he had of late crossed my path, had he so crossed it
<lb/>except to frustrate those schemes, or to disturb those actions,
<lb/>which, if fully carried out, might have resulted in bitter mis-
<lb break="no"/>chief. Poor justification this, in truth, for an authority so
<lb/>imperiously assumed! Poor indemnity for natural rights of
<lb/>self-agency so pertinaciously, so insultingly denied !</p><p></p><p>I had also been forced to notice that my tormentor, for a
<lb/>very long period of time, (while scrupulously and with mira-
<lb break="no"/>culous dexterity maintaining his whim of an identity of ap-
<lb break="no"/>parel with myself,) had so contrived it, in the execution of
<lb/>his varied interference with my will, that I saw not, at any
<lb/>moment, the features of his face. Be Wilson what he might,
<lb/>this, at least, was but the veriest of affectation, or of folly.
<lb/>Could he, for an instant, have supposed that, in my admon-
<lb break="no"/>isher at Eton—in the destroyer of my honor at Oxford,—in
<lb/>him who thwarted my ambition at Rome, my revenge at</p><p><pb n="119"/>
</p><p>Paris, my passionate love at Naples, or what he falsely term-
<lb break="no"/>ed my avarice in Egypt,—that in this, my arch-enemy and
<lb/>evil genius, I could fail to recognise the William Wilson of
<lb/>my schoolboy days,—the namesake, the companion, the riv-
<lb break="no"/>al,—the hated and dreaded rival at Dr. Bransby’s? Impos-
<lb break="no"/>sible!—But let me hasten to the last eventful scene of the
<lb/>drama.</p><p></p><p>Thus far I had succumbed supinely to this imperious dom-
<lb break="no"/>ination. The sentiment of deep awe with which I habitually
<lb/>regarded the elevated character, the majestic wisdom, the
<lb/>apparent omnipresence and omnipotence of Wilson, added to
<lb/>a feeling of even terror, with which certain other traits in
<lb/>his nature and assumptions inspired me, had operated, hith-
<lb break="no"/>erto, to impress me with an idea of my own utter weakness
<lb/>and helplessness, and to suggest an implicit, although bit-
<lb break="no"/>terly reluctant submission to his arbitrary will. But, of late
<lb/>days, I had given myself up entirely to wine ; and its mad-
<lb break="no"/>dening influence upon my hereditary temper rendered me
<lb/>more and more impatient of control. I began to murmur,—
<lb/>to hesitate,—to resist. And was it only fancy which induc-
<lb break="no"/>ed me to believe that, with the increase of my own firmness,
<lb/>that of my tormentor underwent a proportional diminution ?
<lb/>Be this as it may, I now began to feel the inspiration of a
<lb/>burning hope, and at length nurtured in my secret thoughts
<lb/>a stern and desperate resolution that I would submit no long-
<lb break="no"/>er to be enslaved.</p><p></p><p>It was at Rome, during the Carnival of 18—, that I attend-
<lb break="no"/>ed a masquerade in the palazzo of the Neapolitan Duke Di
<lb/>Broglio. I had indulged more freely than usual in the ex-
<lb break="no"/>cesses of the wine-table; and now the suffocating atmosphere
<lb/>of the crowded rooms irritated me beyond endurance. The
<lb/>difficulty, too, of forcing my way through the mazes of the
<lb/>company contributed not a little to the ruffling of my tem-
<lb break="no"/>per ; for I was anxiously seeking, (let me not say with what
<lb/>unworthy motive) the young, the gay, the beautiful wife of
<lb/>the aged and doting Di Broglio. With a too unscrupulous
<lb/>confidence she had previously communicated to me the se-
<lb break="no"/>cret of the costume in which she would be habited, and
<lb/>now, having caught a glimpse of her person, I was hurry-
<lb break="no"/>ing to make my way into her presence.—At this moment I
<lb/>felt a light hand placed upon my shoulder, and that ever-re-
<lb break="no"/>membered, low, damnable whisper within my ear.</p><p></p><p>In an absolute phrenzy of wrath, I turned at once upon
<lb/>him who had thus interrupted me, and seized him violently
<lb/>by the collar. He was attired, as I had expected, in a cos-
<lb break="no"/>tume altogether similar to my own ; wearing a Spanish cloak
<lb/>of blue velvet, begirt about the waist with a crimson belt sus-
<lb break="no"/>taining a rapier. A mask of black silk entirely covered his
<lb/>face.</p><p></p><p>“Scoundrel!” I said, in a voice husky with rage, while
<lb/>every syllable I uttered seemed as new fuel to my fury,
<lb/>“scoundrel! impostor! accursed villain ! you shall not—you
<lb/>shall not dog me unto death! Follow me, or I stab you
<lb/>where you stand !”—and I broke my way from the ball-
<lb break="no"/>room into a small ante-chamber adjoining—dragging him
<lb/>unresistingly with me as I went.</p><p></p><p>Upon entering, I thrust him furiously from me. He stag-
<lb break="no"/>gered against the wall, while I closed the door with an oath,
<lb/>and commanded him to draw. He hesitated but for an in-
<lb break="no"/>stant ; then, with a slight sigh, drew in silence, and put him-
<lb break="no"/>self upon his defence.</p><p></p><p>The contest was brief indeed. I was frantic with every
<lb/>species of wild excitement, and felt within my single arm the
<lb/>energy and power of a multitude. In a few seconds I forc-
<lb break="no"/>ed him by sheer strength against the wainscoting, and thus,</p><p>getting him at mercy, plunged my sword, with brute feroci-
ty, repeatedly through and through his bosom.
</p><p>At that instant some person tried the latch of the door. I
<lb/>hastened to prevent an intrusion, and then immediately re-
<lb break="no"/>turned to my dying antagonist. But what human language
<lb/>can adequately portray that astonishment, that horror which
<lb/>possessed me at the spectacle then presented to view ? The
<lb/>brief moment in which I averted my eyes had been sufficient
<lb/>to produce, apparently, a material change in the arrange-
<lb break="no"/>ments at the upper or farther end of the room. A large mir-
<lb break="no"/>ror,—so at first it seemed to me in my confusion—now stood
<lb/>where none had been perceptible before; and, as I stepped
<lb/>up to it in extremity of terror, mine own image, but with
<lb/>features all pale and dabbled in blood, advanced to meet me
<lb/>with a feeble and tottering gait.</p><p></p><p>Thus it appeared I say, but was not. It was my antago-
<lb break="no"/>nist—it was Wilson, who then stood before me in the ago-
<lb break="no"/>nies of his dissolution. His mask and cloak lay, where he
<lb/>had thrown them, upon the floor. Not a thread in all his
<lb/>raiment—not a line in all the marked and singular linea-

Prose and Verse. By Thomas Hood. Part II.
</p><p>Of this number of the Library we said a few words in our
<lb/>last, but we shall be pardoned for referring to it again, as it
<lb/>contains several of the most characteristic, as well as most
<lb/>meritorious compositions of one of the most remarkable men
<lb/>of his time.</p><p>The quizzical Letters entitled “ Copyright and Copy-
<pb n="120" break="no" />
</p><p>wrong” should be read by all true friends and fair enemies
<lb/>of International Copyright. The strong points of the ques-
<lb break="no"/>tion of copyright, generally, were never more forcibly, if ever
<lb/>more ludicrously, put.</p><p></p><p>“ The Bridge of Sighs” is, with one exception, the finest
<lb/>poem written by Hood. It has been much admired and of-
<lb break="no"/>ten quoted—but we have no hesitation in complying with a
<lb/>friend’s request, to copy it in full. We must omit it, how-
<lb break="no"/>ever, till next week.</p><p></p><p>“ The Haunted House” we prefer to any composition of
<lb/>its author. It is a masterpiece of its kind—and that kind
<lb/>belongs to a very lofty—if not to the very loftiest order of
<lb/>poetical literature. Had we seen this piece before penning
<lb/>our first notice of Hood, we should have had much hesita-
<lb break="no"/>tion in speaking of Fancy and Fantasy as his predominant
<lb/>features. At all events we should have given him credit for
<lb/>much more of true Imagination than we did.</p><p></p><p>Not the least merit of the work is its rigorous simplicity.
<lb/>There is no narrative, and no doggrel philosophy. The
<lb/>whole subject is the description, of a deserted house, which
<lb/>the popular superstition considers haunted. The thesis is
<lb/>one of the truest in all poetry. As a mere thesis it is really
<lb/>difficult to conceive anything better. The strength of the
<lb/>poet is put forth in the invention of traits in keeping with
<lb/>the ideas of crime, abandonment, and ghostly visitation.
<lb/>Every legitimate art is brought in to aid in conveying the
<lb/>intended effects; and (what is quite remarkable in the case
<lb/>of Hood) nothing discordant is at any point introduced. He
<lb/>has here very little of what we have designated as the phan-
<lb break="no"/>tastic—little which is not strictly harmonious. The metre
<lb/>and rhythm are not only, in themselves, admirably adapted
<lb/>to the whole design, but, with a true artistic feeling, the poet
<lb/>has preserved a thorough monotone throughout, and renders
<lb/>its effect more impressive by the repetition (gradually in-
<lb break="no"/>creasing in frequency towards the finale) of one of the most
<lb/>pregnant and effective of the stanzas:</p><p>O’er all there hung a shadow and a fear ;
A sense of mystery the spirit daunted,
And said, as plain as whisper in the ear,
The place is haunted !
We quote a few of the most impressive quatrains:
The coot was swimming in the reedy pond,
Beside the water-hen so soon affrighted,
And in the reedy moat the heron, fond
Of solitude, alighted.
The moping heron, motionless and stiff,
</p><p>That on a stone as silently and stilly
<lb/>Stood, an apparent sentinel, as if
<lb/>To guard the water-lily.</p><p></p><p>The vine unpruned, and the neglected peach
<lb/>Drooped from the wall with which they used to grapple ;
<lb/>And on the cankered tree, in easy reach,</p><p>Rotted the golden apple.
Howbeit, the door I pushed—or so I dreamed—
</p><p>Which slowly, slowly, gaped—the hinges creaking
<lb/>With such a rusty eloquence, it seemed
<lb/>That Time himself was speaking.</p><p>The startled bats flew out, bird after bird,
The screech-owl overhead began to flutter,
And seemed to mock the cry that she had heard
Some dying victim utter.
A shriek that echoed from the joisted roof
And up the stair and further still and further,
Till in some ringing chamber far aloof
It ceased its tale of murther.
Meanwhile the rusty armor rattled round,
The banner shuddered and the ragged streamer;
All things the horrid tenor of the sound
Acknowledged with a tremor.
The very stains and fractures on the wall,
Assuming features solemn and terrific,
Hinted some tragedy of that old hall,
Locked up in hieroglyphic.
Some tale that might, perchance, have solved the doubt
Wherefore amongst those flags so dull and livid,
The banner of the Bloody Hand shone out
So ominously vivid.
Those dreary stairs, where with the sounding stress
Of ev’ry step so many echoes blended,
The mind, with dark misgivings, feared to guess
How many feet ascended.
Yet no portentous shape the sight amazed;
Each object plain, and tangible, and valid;
But from their tarnished frames dark figures gazed,
And faces spectre-pallid.
Not merely with the mimic life that lies
Within the compass of Art’s simulation:
Their souls were looking through their painted eyes
With awful speculation.
On every lip a speechless horror dwelt;
On every brow the burden of affliction ;
The old ancestral spirits knew and felt
The house's malediction.
Rich hangings, storied by the needle’s art,
With scripture history, or classic fable ;
But all had faded, save one ragged part,
Where Cain was slaying Abel.
The death-watch ticked behind the panneled oak.
Inexplicable tremors shook the arras,
And echoes strange and mystical awoke,
The fancy to embarrass.
Prophetic hints that filled the soul with dread,
But through one gloomy entrance pointing mostly,
The while some secret inspiration said,
That chamber is the ghostly !
Had Hood only written “ The Haunted House” it would
have sufficed to render him immortal.

The Indicator and Companion. By Leigh Hunt. Part II.
</p><p>This volume contains some two or three papers which are
<lb/>worth preserving—which have in them the elements of life
<lb/>—and which will leave a definite and perhaps a permanent
<lb/>impression upon every one who reads them In general,
<lb/>however, it is made up of that species of easy writing which
<lb/>is not the easiest reading. We find here too much of slip-
<lb break="no"/>shodiness, both in thought and manner, and too little of de-
<lb break="no"/>termined purpose. The tone is not that of a bold genius
<lb/>uttering vigorous things carelessly and inconsiderately, with
<lb/>contempt or neglect of method or completeness, but rather
<lb/>that of a naturally immethodical and inaccurate intellect,
<lb/>making a certain air of ruggedness and insouciance the
<lb/>means of exalting the commonplace into the semblance of
<lb/>originality and strength. Hunt has written many agreeable
<lb/>papers, but no great ones. His points will bear no steady
<lb/>examination. The view at first taken of him by the public
<lb/>is far nearer the truth, perhaps, than that which seems to
<lb/>have been latterly adopted. His “Feast of the Poets ” is
<lb/>possibly his best composition. As a rambling essayist he
<lb/>has too little of the raw material. As a critic he is merely
<lb/>saucy, or lackadaisical, or falsely enthusiastic, or at best
<lb/>pointedly conceited. His judgment is not worth a rush —</p><p><pb n="121"/>
</p><p>witness his absurd eulogies on Coleridge's “Pains of Sleep”
<lb/>quoted in the volume before us. In his “ Remarks upon (on)
<lb/>De Basso’s Ode to a Dead Body,” he has said critically some
<lb/>of the very best things it ever occurred to him to say; but
<lb/>if there be need to show the pure imbecility and irrelevancy
<lb/>of the paper as a criticism, let it only be contrasted with
<lb/>what a truly critical spirit would write. The highest liter-
<lb break="no"/>ary quality of Hunt is a secondary or tertiary grade of Fan-
<lb break="no"/>cy. His loftiest literary attainment is to entertain. This is
<lb/>precisely the word which suits his case. As for excitement
<lb/>we must not look for it in him. And, unhappily, his books
<lb/>are not of such character that they may be taken up, with
<lb/>pleasure, (as may the “ Spectator,”) by a mind exhausted
<lb/>through excitement. In this condition we require repose—
<lb/>which is the antipode of the style of Hunt. And since for
<lb/>the ennuyé he has insufficient stimulus, it is clear that as an
<lb/>author he is fit for very little, if really for any thing at all.</p><p></p><p>Introductory Lectures on Modern History, delivered in Lent
<lb/>Term, 1842, with the Inaugural Lecture delivered in De-
<lb break="no"/>cember, 1841. By Thomas Arnold, D. D., Regius Profes-
<lb break="no"/>sor of Modem History in the Univ rsity of Oxford, &amp;c.
<lb/>Edited from the Second London Edition, with a Preface
<lb/>and Notes, by Henry Reed, M. A., Professor of English
<lb/>Literature in the University of Pennsylvania. New-York:
<lb/>D. Appleton &amp; Co.</p><p></p><p>We take it for granted that there are few of our readers un-
<lb break="no"/>acquainted with the great celebrity of these Lectures, or
<lb/>with the high estimation in which they are held by the his-
<lb break="no"/>torical scholars of Europe. We feel called upon, therefore,
<lb/>to say only a very few words of the book. It would be dif-
<lb break="no"/>ficult, indeed, to say too much, were we to discuss its excel-
<lb break="no"/>lences. Independently of his sterling worth as mere histo-
<lb break="no"/>rian, Dr. Arnold must command the attention and respect of
<lb/>every American by his earnest and most influential zeal as
<lb/>an Apostle of Liberty. The Preface (by Dr. Reed) to this
<lb/>American edition, is an admirably written commentary on 
<lb/>the man.</p><p></p><p>The Messrs. Appleton have recently published “ The Life
<lb/>and Correspondence ” and “ The Miscellaneous Works ” of
<lb/>Doctor Arnold, both edited by Arthur P. Stanley, M. A.
<lb/>These volumes are published uniformly with the one now
<lb/>before us ; and all are in the beautiful style so usual with

<lb break="no"/>dies at Home and at School. By Miss Catherine E. Beech-
<lb break="no"/>er. Revised Edition, with Numerous Additions and Illus-
<lb break="no"/>trative Engravings. New-York: Harper &amp; Brothers.</p><p></p><p>This volume is so well known, and so thoroughly apprecia-
<lb break="no"/>ted, that we need only call attention to the issue of an im-
<lb break="no"/>proved edition. It is very generally adopted as a text-book
<lb/>in female schools. It has been examined by the Massachu-
<lb break="no"/>setts Board of Education, and by them deemed worthy of ad-
<lb break="no"/>mission as a part of the Massachusetts School Library—an
<lb/>honor which speaks for itself.</p><p>Simms’ Magazine,
</p><p>For August, is capital. It contains several of the finest kind
<lb/>of Magazine papers, and is as ably edited as any journal of
<lb/>its species in America—if not more ably edited than any. We
<lb/>invite attention to several Sonnets (anonymous,) and to the
<lb/>articles entitled “ The Epochs and Events of American His-
<lb break="no"/>tory, as suited to the Purposes of Art in Fiction;" “The Su-
<lb break="no"/>baltern’s Yarn;" “ Bayard the Chevalier;” and “A Foreign-
<lb break="no"/>er’s First Glimpses of Georgia.”</p><p>As a matter of course we find Mr. Simms agreeing with 
</p><p>ourselves, “ The Democratic Review,” and in fact with all
<lb/>the unprejudiced critics of the country, in condemning, near-
<lb break="no"/>ly altogether, the very mediocres poems of Mr. Lord. We
<lb/>quote a sentence or two of Mr. Simms’ critique.</p><p></p><p>Metaphysical poetry requires deep sedateness of mood, habitual
<lb/>contemplation, and much of that quieting sort of thought which a rare
<lb/>experience of the world alone can give. Wanting all this, the poems
<lb/>of Mr. Lord, which aim at this character, are vague, wordy, purpose-
<lb break="no"/>less ; without those leading views of his topic which alone can justify
<lb/>the author in attempting it. We see the fruits of his reading, not of
<lb/>his genius, in the poem called “ Worship.” Here is a little of Bryant,
<lb/>and here something more of Coleridge. Phrases from these and other
<lb/>poets are conspicuous upon every page—some of these strangely ob-
<lb break="no"/>trusive, as at p. 8, the “ temple-hunting martlets” of Shakspeare.
<lb/>The ode “ To an American Statesman,” strikes us as a very decided
<lb/>imitation of that to the American flag, by Drake, and faint efforts in
<lb/>the way of Tennyson and Longfellow, are evident as we turn his
<lb/>pages.</p><p></p><p>That Mr. Lord can think, and may, by severe training, and some-
<lb break="no"/>times scourging, be made to think, we have proof in this little volume.
<lb/>We see here and there the head or tail of an idea, the wing or the
<lb/>pen-feathers of a fancy, which elaboration might have rendered legi-
<lb break="no"/>timately his own. That he has a spiritual mood at work is apparent
<lb/>also. But there is no one piece in the collection, no, nor no one para-
<lb break="no"/>graph of any length, which may be considered tolerably perfect, and
<lb/>fit for selection.</p><p>Simms' Magazine is published in Charleston, by Burges

<lb break="no"/>ian heart. He has been grossly maligned, not because mis-

countrymen. The “ Florentine Histories ” show his great
powers—but not in their clearest light.

</p><p>Sale of Pictures at Bordentown.—We mentioned, a

<lb/>public sale, at Bordentown, on the 17th and 19th of Septem-
<lb break="no"/>ber, 1845. The gallery will be open for examination every
<lb/>day until the day of sale. For the information of those who
<lb/>intend to be present at the sale, but who may not be able to
<lb/>procure a catalogue previous to going on, we subjoin the
<lb/>Terms of Sale:</p><p>1st. The sale will commence at 11 o’clock on each day,
and proceed in regular order, according to the catalogue.
</p><p>2d. The purchasers to give their names and places of

<lb/>the purchase money ; in default of which, the lot so pur-
<lb break="no"/>chased to be immediately put up again and re-sold.</p><p></p><p>3d. All bills to be settled in full within three days from
<lb/>the day of sale, (before delivery of the paintings,) otherwise
<lb/>they may be re-sold at the expense of the purchaser.</p><p>The pictures will be sold by Thomas Birch, Jr., who, be-
<pb n="123" break="no" />
</p><p>ing himself a painter of merit, will, undoubtedly, do full
<lb/>justice to the beauty and the character of the works entrust-
<lb break="no"/>ed to his care.</p><p></p><p>On looking through the catalogue we find the names of
<lb/>many eminent masters. Rubens has four pictures ; subject,
<lb/>figures and animals—and a fifth, in which the figures are by
<lb/>Rubens, and the fruit and flowers by Sneyders. Rembrandt
<lb/>has two pictures; subject, Turkish heads. A. Carracchi has
<lb/>one; subject, Christ and his Disciples at Sea. Gaspar Pous-
<lb break="no"/>sin has one; a rich Landscape. Guercino has one; subject,
<lb/>Herod receiving the head of John the Baptist on a charger.
<lb/>The design embraces a group of ten figures. Canaletti has
<lb/>one ; subject, view of London Bridge. Sneyders has seve-
<lb break="no"/>ral ; subject generally, Birds, with Landscape, &amp;c. There
<lb/>are also many pictures by David Teniers, Berghem, Van
<lb/>Eyck, Ruysdael, Terburgh, Adriensen, Swebach, Vander-
<lb break="no"/>linck, Bloemart, &amp;c. The Vernets have also many beautiful
<lb/>Landscapes and Marine views. Lebrun, Philip de Cham-
<lb break="no"/>pagne, St. Denis, Laurent de la Hyre, &amp;c., are well repre-
<lb break="no"/>sented. There are besides very many pictures in the various
<lb/>schools — the Italian, Dutch, Flemish, and French, ancient
<lb/>and modern.</p><p></p><p>We had almost forgotten to state that there are many in-
<lb break="no"/>teresting pieces of sculpture, executed chiefly by Canova,
<lb/>Bartolini, and Rosio—marble busts of Napoleon’s sisters,
<lb/>Pauline and Eliza—his father, Charles Bonaparte, and his
<lb/>wife Maria Louisa — two splendid Medici Vases of Porphy-
<lb break="no"/>ry, three feet in height — one of them presented to Joseph
<lb/>Bonaparte by the King of Sweden—also some antique Bronze
<lb/>Castings from Pompeii, with other interesting items which
<lb/>we have not, at present, space to enumerate.</p><p></p><p>From what we have said, it will be found that this collec-
<lb break="no"/>tion is worthy the attention of connoiseurs in art, for
<lb/>though we do not claim for them the position of first class
<lb/>pictures, yet can we safely assert their general, and, in some
<lb/>cases, remarkable excellence. We shall probably refer to
<lb/>this collection previously to the day of sale.</p><p></p><p>One Thousand Pounds are hereby offered to the Artist who shall
<lb/>produce the best Oil Painting of the Baptism of Christ by immer-

The City in the Sea.
</p><p>Lo! Death has reared himself a throne
<lb/>In a strange city lying alone
<lb/>Far down within the dim West,</p><p>Where the good and the bad and the worst and the best 
Have gone to their eternal rest.
There shrines and palaces and towers
(Time-eaten towers that tremble not!)
Resemble nothing that is ours.
Around, by lifting winds forgot,
Resignedly beneath the sky
The melancholy waters lie.
No rays from the holy heaven come down
On the long night-time of that town ;
But light from out the lurid sea
Streams up the turrets silently—
Gleams up the pinnacles far and free—
Up domes—up spires—up kingly halls—
Up fanes—up Babylon-like walls—
Up shadowy long-forgotten bowers
Of sculptured ivy and stone flowers—
</p><p>Up many and many a marvelous shrine
<lb/>Whose wreathed friezes intertwine
<lb/>The viol, the violet, and the vine.</p><p>Resignedly beneath the sky
The melancholy waters lie.
So blend the turrets and shadows there
That all seem pendulous in air,
While from a proud tower in the town
Death looks gigantically down.
There open fanes and gaping graves
Yawn level with the luminous waves ;
But not the riches there that lie
In each idol’s diamond eye—
Not the gaily-jewelled dead
Tempt the waters from their bed ;
For no ripples curl, alas !
Along that wilderness of glass—
No swellings tell that winds may be
Upon some far-off happier sea—
No heavings hint that winds have been
On seas less hideously serene.
But lo, a stir is in the air!
The wave—there is a movement there!
As if the towers had thrust aside.
In slightly sinking, the dull tide—
As if their tops had feebly given
A void within the filmy Heaven.
The waves have now a redder glow—
The Hours are breathing faint and low—
And when, amid no earthly moans,
Down, down that town shall settle hence,
Hell, rising from a thousand thrones,
Shall do it reverence.

</p><p>Mr. Sheppard, a Bass singer of considerable merit, as we
<lb/>have been told, who appeared at the Park Theatre four or
<lb/>five years since, has arrived in this city, and purposes giving
<lb/>a concert in the early part of the ensuing month. He has
<lb/>numerous warm and influential friends in New York, and will
<lb/>doubtless have a crowded room.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Frederick Horncastle has arrived at Boston, from Lon-
<lb break="no"/>don, and intends giving his highly popular entertainments
<lb/>founded on English character and Irish music.</p><p>The Misses Bramson are giving concerts at New Haven.
</p><p>The French Opera Company opened at Niblo’s on Mon-
<lb break="no"/>day evening. We understand that they have met with re-
<lb break="no"/>markable success, but we have been unable to attend.</p><p></p><p>Signor Antognini is in Canada, and is engaged to get up
<lb/>two grand musical entertainments for parties there. He has
<lb/>sent to New York lor Vocal and Instrumental music to be pre-
<lb break="no"/>sented on each occasion.</p><p>Signor Pico and Lycion De Begnis open the Royal Olym-
pic Theatre at Montreal early in September.
</p><p>The little Misses Kilmiste, better known as the Infant
<lb/>Sisters, gave two concerts, or rather entertainments, at Pal-
<lb break="no"/>mo’s Theatre this week. The following announcement will
<lb/>be found curious and amusing.</p><p></p><p>For Two Nights Only.—Fashionable and elegant performances of
<lb/>the little Misses Kilmiste, known as the Infant Sisters. Tuesday eve-
<lb break="no"/>ning, Aug. 26th, will be performed the admired Burletta, called Dis-
<lb break="no"/>appointment. Principal characters by the Infant Sisters. Mr. Hyde,
<lb/>of London, will perform Overtures, Operatic Airs, and Brilliant Vari-
<lb break="no"/>ations, upon a Penny Whistle. The whole concluding wixh the ad-
<lb break="no"/>mired Burletta, called Papa Jerome, or Les Petites Amantes.</p><p></p><p>A letter has been received in New Orleans from Mexico,
<lb/>dated July 22, giving an account of the reception of Mad.
<lb/>Borghese and other members of the Italian company, late of
<lb/>this city. It was enthusiastic in the extreme. They were
<lb/>in the finest health. The engagement will conclude about
<lb/>the last of November or the beginning of the following
<lb/>month, and then the company will return to New Orleans.</p><p>A new song, rather popular, commences with the words,
“Ha ! ha ! laughed the ivy !’’
</p><p>Miss Delcy and the rest of the English opera company
<lb/>will begin their engagement at the Park shortly. Mr. Ra-
<lb break="no"/>plino will direct the operas.</p><p></p><p>We shall attend to the Musical Publications of Mess. E.
<lb/>Ferrett &amp; Co. very particularly in our next. We acknow-
<lb break="no"/>edge the receipt of Strauss’ Waltzes—Beauties of La Norma
<lb/>—and Airs from The Bohemian Girl. Mess. Ferrett &amp; Co.
<lb/>publish this music at a wonderfully low price.</p><p>The Drama.
</p><p>Under this head there is but little to observe. In New-
<lb break="no"/>York, during the last fortnight, the theatres, without excep-
<lb break="no"/>tion, have been unusually well attended. At the Park the
<lb/>present company is by no means strong. Mrs. Mowatt con-
<lb break="no"/>cluded a short engagement on the 23d ; playing Pauline,
<lb/>Gertrude, in her own “ Fashion” and other róles. Her audi-
<lb break="no"/>ences were large and highly respectable. The enthusiasm</p><p></p><p>was unabated. She is evidently improving, and that rapidly.
<lb/> We have no hesitation in prophesying for her a brilliant fu-
<lb break="no"/> ture—if she be but true to herself. Her worst mannerism is
<lb/>an audible drawing in of the breath. Her action is uneqaul-
<lb break="no"/>led in spirit and grace. Some of the intonations of her voice,
<lb/>are rich beyond expression, and have an obvious effect up-
<lb break="no"/>on the finer spirits of an audience. Her elocution is of a no-
<lb break="no"/>ble order. She is much better supported than formerly by
<lb/>Mr. Crisp. He also, has improved. We noticed this, espe-
<lb break="no"/>cially, in the greater dignity which he gives Melnotte while
<lb/>personating the Prince. It was his fashion, once, to play the
<lb/>part, at this point, as if a brainless coxcomb were the author’s
<lb/>intention. Mr. Bass is a great acquisition to any theatre,
<lb/>and we are surprised to see the coolness with which so truly
<lb/>admirable an actor has been received. His Damas was
<lb/>Nature herself. The part could not have been more truthful-
<lb break="no"/>ly done. Miss Fanny Gordon is a fifth or sixth rate perfor-
<lb break="no"/>mer, with whom we were not particularly pleased.</p><p></p><p>On Monday last, Mr. Hackett made his bow to a Park au-
<lb break="no"/>dience as Falstaff. Of course he was warmly received.
<lb/>The boxes were thoroughly filled, and with a judicious au-
<lb break="no"/>dience.</p><p></p><p>In looking over the play-bills of the Park for the coming
<lb/>season, we were surprised not to find the name of Mr. Mur-
<lb break="no"/>doch. For several months it had been understood, through
<lb/>the city, that he was to perform here at a very early period.
<lb/>We now learn that he will not appear till towards the close
<lb/>of October—on account of Mr. Simpson's foreign engage-
<lb break="no"/>ments. Mr. Murdoch is an American, has noble views of his
<lb/>art, and has labored diligently in its acquisition. He has
<lb/>omitted nothing in the way of self-discipline, and will inev-
<lb break="no"/>itably rank high.</p><p></p><p>At the Bowery Mr. J. M. Scott has been playing his usual
<lb/>characters with success. This theatre has great capabilities
<lb/>which it is a pity were not improved. The stage appoint-
<lb break="no"/>ments want richness, but we presume it is the intention to
<lb/>remedy this evil in the end. Much of the forest scenery is
<lb/>ill conceived. Light is undoubtedly wanting, on the audi-
<lb break="no"/>ence, and color in the pannelings of the boxes, as well as the
<lb/>ceiling. The general coup d'œil of the theatre cannot be
<lb/>compared for an instant with that of the Park, yet its capabi-
<lb break="no"/>lities, we say, are greater. A trifling outlay would render it
<lb/>the handsomer theatre.</p><p>At Niblo's the audiences have been, as usual, large and
respectable. In the performances no particular variation.
The Chatham Street has been doing very well with Ma-
zeppa.
</p><p>Mr. Burton of the Walnut Street Theatre offers a premi-
<lb break="no"/>um of One Thousand Dollars for the best original American
<lb/>Comedy.</p><p>Signora Suarez, one of the stars of the Teatro de Tacon,
Havana, took a benefit on the 4th inst.
S’ra Corcuera, another star, was to have hers on the 11th.
</p><p>Mr. Arrilla, director of the Equestrian company which ar-
<lb break="no"/>rived from France at Matanzas on the 30th July, died on the
<lb/>5th of August, of the yellow fever.</p><p></p><p>The dramatic company of Senors Robunos gave a great
<lb/>representation in Puerto Principe, for the benefit of the suf-
<lb break="no"/>ferers by the last great fire in Matanzas.</p><p></p><p>J. M. Scott, has the agency of the western theatrical cir-
<lb break="no"/>cuit, which comprises some thirty or forty theatres. It is
<lb/>said that he will take about two hundred actors and actres-
<lb break="no"/>ses with him.</p><p><pb n="125"/>

</p><p>Carey &amp; Hart will publish in October “ Literature and
<lb/>Art in America, with an Introductory Plea for Copyright,
<lb/>Universal and Perpetual: by Rufus W. Griswold ”—in one
<lb/>volume octavo.</p><p></p><p>The first complete American edition of the Poems of

</p><p>It is remarkable that the sturdy republican and puritan

<lb/>will in a few days issue, in two large and elegantly printed

<lb/>has been established in the University of Vermont, and the

<lb break="no"/>tution, has been chosen to fill it.</p><p></p><p>We forgot to say, last week, that the “ Schnell Post,"
<lb/>published in New-York, has, by a ministerial edict, been
<lb/>forbidden to be taken at the Cabinets de Lecture, of Leipsic.
<lb/>The exact reason of the prohibition does not yet appear.</p><p></p><p>Messrs. F. W. Thomas (author of “ Clinton Bradshaw”)
<lb/>and Judge A. B. Meek, of Tuscaloosa, Ala., (now at Wash-
<lb break="no"/>ington,) are about to establish a Monthly Magazine. We
<lb/>know both parties as men of talent.</p><p>Mr. Kendall is proceeding with his Life of Jackson.
</p><p>Our friend of “ The Germantown Telegraph ” (a very
<lb/>excellent paper) asks us, with much pertinence, why we call
<lb/>our sheet “ The Broadway Journal ” when it is published in
<lb/>Nassau street. Be it known, that we originated in Broad-
<lb break="no"/>way — were merely seduced by circumstances into Nassau
<lb/>street pro tem. Our destiny however is Broadway. It is
<lb/>Broadway to which we speak. We shall get back to Broad-
<lb break="no"/>way at our earliest convenience.</p><p></p><p>Talking of titles; — while the very respectable “Tele-
<lb break="no"/>graph ” demurs to our “ Broadway ” moiety, two or three
<lb/>Prints not quite so respectable (at least in common sense) ob-,
<lb/>ject to the “Journal ” half. “ A journal,” say they, “is a
<lb/>daily, and nothing else.” The word "journal," to be sure,
<lb/>from the French journie, was a term originally applied to a
<lb/>daily record of events, and was precisely equivalent to “ dia-
<lb break="no"/>ry ”—but in common with a multitude of words its primi- 
<lb/>tive meaning gradually amplified itself, until it vanished al-
<lb break="no"/>together. A journal now is merely a record, generally speak-
<lb break="no"/>ing and for the primitive meaning we fall back upon “diary. </p><p>The argumentum ad absurdum will soon reduce our inquisi-
tors to reason. If primitive meanings are to be adhered to,
we might maintain that Mr. T-----is no sycophant merely
because he is not in the habit of discovering figs.
</p><p>Some time ago we published, as the composition of Wil-
<lb break="no"/>liam Gilmore Simms, a little poem called “ The Whippoor-
<lb break="no"/>will.” It belongs to Dr. Bird, of “ Calavar” memory.</p><p></p><p>The Misses Sedgwick (nieces of the authoress) have es-
<lb break="no"/>tablished a school at 42 West Washington Place. Their ac-
<lb break="no"/>complishments are well known, and of their capacity for the
<lb/>task assumed, no one acquainted with them can entertain a
<lb/>doubt. The Mirror says justly:</p><p></p><p>The name of Sedgwick alone is a recommendation for a school: it
<lb/>is associated with candor, benevolence, and knowledge of the physical
<lb/>and moral laws, and we believe it is rarely in vain that one of a name
<lb/>should show such excellence ; it kindles aspiration and imparts life to
<lb/>others who bear it.</p><p></p><p>“ Here the journeymen,” says the last number of Gra-
<lb break="no"/>ham's Magazine, “ place two scales upon one another at
<lb/>right angles, thus X.” The sentence is a fine exemplifica-
<lb break="no"/>tion of the expediency of “ letting well alone.” It would
<lb/>have been wiser to stop at the “ right angles.”</p><p>An exchange paper says:—
</p><p>“ In the United States Gazette of Friday last, we find, credited to
<lb/>the London World of Fashion for July, a story entitled ‘ Mary, or the
<lb/>Blighted Blossom.' It looked to us at once like an old acquaintance ;
<lb/>and on turning to our files we found that on the 19th of February last
<lb/>was published in this paper, credited to the Buffalo Daily Gazette, a
<lb/>narrative headed ‘ Mary, or the Triumph of the Heart over Itself,’
<lb/>which is word for word, so far as we continued the examination, the
<lb/>same as the ‘ Mary’ first noticed, and which we have a dim recollec-
<lb break="no"/>tion of having at the time copied from the U. S. Gazette. This is only
<lb/>one instance among many in which British periodicals have appropri-
<lb break="no"/>ated to themselves, without acknowledgement, the productions of
<lb/>American minds.”</p><p></p><p>Very true:—and, what is more, it is astonishing to see
<lb/>how a Magazine article, like a traveller, spruces up after
<lb/>crossing the sea. We ourselves have had the honor of being
<lb/>pirated without mercy—but as we found our articles impro-
<lb break="no"/>ved by the process (at least in the opinion of our countrymen)
<lb/>we said nothing, as a matter of course. We have written
<lb/>paper after paper which attracted no notice at all until it ap-
<lb break="no"/>peared as original in “ Bentley’s Miscellany” or the “ Paris
<lb/>Charivari.” The “ Boston Notion” once abused us very lus-
<lb break="no"/>tily for having written “ The House of Usher.” Not long
<lb/>afterwards Bentley published it anonymously, as original
<lb/>with itself,—whereupon “ The Notion,” having forgotten
<lb/>that we wrote it, not only lauded it ad nauseam, but copied
<lb/>it in toto.</p><p></p><p>Robert Dale Owen, in a late letter to “ The Tribune,”
<lb/>fully exculpates himself from the charge of having plagiar-
<lb break="no"/>zed a song, bodily. He says:</p><p></p><p>I	published in the year 1887, a historical drama, entitled “ Pocahon-
<lb break="no"/>tas,” indulgently noticed by the press at the lime, and in that drama,
<lb/>introduced the Song in question (at page 76.) To this drama notes
<lb/>were appended, and the note to page 74 read as follows ;</p><p>’ Tis home where'er the heart is, &amp;c.
</p><p>"	This Song is altered from some fugitive ballad that pleased me at
<lb/>the time that I read it, and has remained in my memory ; though I
<lb/>have forgotten or never knew, the author’s name.”</p><p></p><p>I need hardly add, that the lines appeared in the ' Chaplet of
<lb/>Mercy,’ as mine, equally without my consent or knowledge ; sent
<lb/>thither, doubtless, by some friend who may have seen the Song in the
<lb/>little work in question, and had overlooked the disclaiming note.</p><p><pb n="126"/>

VERSE AND PROSE, by Thomas Hood—Part I,
forming No. 16 of the Library or Choice Reading, beautifully
printed. Price 50 cents.	
</p><p>  "Of all the humorists, Hood was the most poetical. When deal-
<lb break="no"/>ing with the most familiar subjects, whether it might be a sweep be-
<lb break="no"/>wailing the suppression of his cry, or a mother searching through St.
<lb/>Giles’s for her lost infant, or a Miss Kilmansegg’s golden childhood—
<lb/>there was hardly a verse in which some touches of heart , or some play
<lb/>of fancy, did not beckon the laughing reader away into far other
<lb/>Worlds than the jester’s.”—London Athenӕum.</p><p></p><p>" The smile and the sigh were ever blended together ; the laugh at
<lb/>the grotesque idea and whimsical imagination, (rarely seeing objects
<lb/>as others saw them,) and the tear which must flow on such pathetic
<lb/>Narratives as Eugene Aram or the Old Elm Tree. Without a parallel
<lb/>and original as Hood was in the ludicrous, his more enduring fame
<lb/>will rest on the exquisitely humane and simply compassionate.”—Lite-
<lb break="no"/>rary Gazette.	,</p><p></p><p>” He was the inventer of a new sort of guano to fertilize men's
<lb/>minds, and to make them produce larger crops of good actions: or rath-
<lb break="no"/>er it was an intellectual compost that he invented, and the materials
<lb/>of which were satire softened by kindness, and ridicule tempered with
<lb/>good feeling.”—Hood's Magazine for June. Published and for sale

J. F. BROWNE &amp; CO.
MANUFACTURERS OF THE
IMPROVED PATENT DOUBLE-ACTION HARP,
By Royal Letters Patent, London. Established 1810. (Many years with Erard,
J.F. BROWNE respectfully informs his Friends and the Musical World, that he has established himself for
  the manufacture and importation of these very beautiful instruments, at
281 BROADWAY, and 73 1-2 CHAMBERS STREET.
His arrangements are such as to enable him to transact business at European prices, thereby saving purchasers the high duties imposed by
Tariff on these Instruments.
</p><p>J. F. Browne would observe, these Harps are constructed on the most approved principles, with all the modem improvements of London and
<lb/>Paris, are unequalled in brilliancy of lone, fineness of touch, and perfectness of mechanism. Particular care is taken to fit them for the ex-
<lb break="no"/>tremes of climate in this country, in which respect they will be found far superior to any of European manufacture, imported in the usual way.</p><p>These Harps are patronized by the elite of musical taste and professional talent in Europe; among the latter, he would mention N. C Bochsa,
who invariably selects from this establishment.
J. F. Browne begs to offer the opinions of some of the first professional talent in this country.
</p><p>Mb. J. F. Browne, Sir :—Having had for several years past, the opportunity of making a professional use of your Harps, and of testing
<lb/>their qualities, it affords me pleasure to certify, that in point of tone, workmanship, and above all, a solidity that stands proof against the in-
<lb break="no"/>constancy of our trying climate, they have in all cases given me the most entire satisfaction. I am yours, CHARLES THIBAULT,,
<lb/>January, 1845.	No. 40 Beach Street, N. Y.</p><p></p><p>Dear Sir :—I write to express the delight I experienced in performing on one of your Harps at Sig. Casella’s Concert in this city. The
<lb/>mechanism is perfect, and the quality of Tone certainly superior to any harp I have heard for many years. I remember my old Master,
<lb/>Bochsa, always gave the preference to your Harps, indeed he himself used no other.	Yours, most truly, H. G. TRUST.</p><p>Philadelphia, March 4th, 1844.
</p><p>Mr. J. F. Browne, Sir :—I have much pleasure in saying, that the Harp of your make I performed on at the St. George’s Society Concert,
<lb/>is, in brilliancy of lone, touch and elegance of workmanship, the finest I ever played on. This will apply to all your Harps. The Grand six
<lb/>and a half Gothic Double action, is a most splendid instrument.	Yours, with respect, ELIZABETH SLOMAN.</p><p>New York, January 16th, 1845.	A pupil of N. C. Bochsa.
</p><p>Mr. J. F. Browne, Sir :—Having at your request closely scrutinized your double-action Harps. I find they possess the best qualities of the
<lb/>first Makers in Europe combined. That the ease of touch, by which the most brilliant tone is obtained, the perfection and case of modulation,
<lb/>they are superior to any I have used; their elegance of exterior must gratify the most refined taste. Your new Grand Gothic six and a half oc-
<lb break="no"/>tavo, is the most splendid effort of art yet produced in the musical world; it will give me great pleasure in recommending your Harps at every
<lb/>opportunity.	Yours Truly, HENRY HORN.</p><p>January 12th, 1854.	An eminent professor, and Member of the Royal Academy.
</p><p>These are but a very small part of the testimonials received, but will suffice to show the estimate of persons every way capable of making a
<lb/>correct decision. J. F. Browne has also received the Franklin Medal of the Society of Arts, Philadelphia, for his splendid improvements in
<lb/>this delightful Instrument.</p><p>Harps from 300 to 1000 dollars. Harps repaired, strings, &amp;c.

</p><p>THIS is the only thorough, complete and progressive work
<lb/>yet published in this country. Where pupils have used this me-
<lb break="no"/>thod, the most rapid advancement has been observed in all cases.
<lb/>The most prominent feature of this work is that the lessons, exerci-
<lb break="no"/>ses, scales and studies are given in such progressive order, that they
<lb/>enlist the interest of pupils, and carry them almost imperceptibly
<lb/>through those mechanical difficulties which, otherwise, are too often
<lb/>made irksome in other instruction books. The time has arrived when
<lb/>a superficial knowledge of the Piano is of but little account, and it is
<lb/>only by the study of such methods as Bertini’s that pupils will be ena-
<lb break="no"/>bled to read music with facility, and at the same time become good
<lb/>musicians.</p><p></p><p>This method commences in the most plain and simple manner ; the
<lb/>rudiments of music being given and illustrated at the same time, and
<lb/>each lesson is fully explained by marginal notes on the same page.</p><p></p><p>The publishers are in possession of the highest recommendations
<lb/>from professional gentlemen, who speak of the superior merits of
<lb/>Bertini’s Method over all others yet published in this country, most
<lb/>of them having used the foreign copies previously. It will only be
<lb/>necessary to give a few of the names in the principal cities.</p><p>Boston.	New-York.
