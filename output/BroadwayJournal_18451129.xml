TO MISS ANNE C. LYNCH.
As on the tempest-chafed and struggling sea
In silence falls the pensile, silvery beam,
And the vexed waters murmur tranquilly,
And imaged there the stars of beauty gleam,—
Even so—sweet lady—o’er my spirit glide
Thy lyre’s soft melodies, like summer light;
And lo, within, as on the moonlit tide,
A vision fairer than the heaven of night!
Oh, ever might the high and holy Thought
Waked by thy muse—the senseless heart enfold,
As once warm life within the marble cold
With passionate clasp the noble sculptor wrought,—
Thus would the flame that still aspires on high
Be kindled there—thus life be bom that could not die!
E. F. ELLET.
A Tale of the  Ragged Mountains.
</p><p>During the fall of the year 1827, while residing near
<lb/>Charlottesville, Virginia, I casually made the acquaint-
<lb break="no"/>ance of Mr. Augustus Bedloe. This young gentleman
<lb/>was remarkable in every respect, and excited in me a
<lb/>profound interest and curiosity. I found it impossible to
<lb/>comprehend him either in his moral or his physical rela-
<lb break="no"/>tions. Of his family I could obtain no satisfactory ac-
<lb break="no"/>count. Whence he came, I never ascertained. Even
<lb/>about his age—although I call him a young gentleman—
<lb/>there was something which perplexed me in no little de-
<lb break="no"/>gree. He certainly seemed young—and he made a
<lb/>point of speaking about his youth—yet there were mo-
<lb break="no"/>ments when I should have had little trouble in imagining
<lb/>him a hundred years of age. But in no regard was he
<lb/>more peculiar than in his personal appearance. He was
<lb/>singularly tall and thin. He stooped much. His limbs
<lb/>were exceedingly long and emaciated. His forehead was
<lb/>broad and low. His complexion was absolutely bloodless.
<lb/>His mouth was large and flexible, and his teeth were
<lb/>more wildly uneven, although sound, than I had ever be-
<lb break="no"/>fore seen teeth in a human head. The expression of his
<lb/>smile, however, was by no means unpleasing, as might
<lb/>be supposed ; but it had no variation whatever. It was
<lb/>one of profound melancholy—of a phaseless and unceas-
<lb break="no"/>ing gloom. His eyes were abnormally large, and round
<lb/>like those of a cat. The pupils, too, upon any accession
<lb/>or diminution of light, underwent contraction or dilation,
<lb/>just such as is observed in the feline tribe. In moments
<lb/>of excitement the orbs grew bright to a degree almost in-
<lb break="no"/>conceivable ; seeming to emit luminous rays, not of a re-
<lb break="no"/>flected, but of an intrinsic lustre, as does a candle or the
<lb/>sun; yet their ordinary condition was so totally vapid,</p><p>filmy and dull, as to convey the idea of the eyes of a
long-interred corpse.
</p><p>These peculiarities of person appeared to cause him
<lb/>much annoyance, and he was continually alluding to them
<lb/>in a sort of half explanatory, half apologetic strain,
<lb/>which, when I first heard it, impressed me very painfully.</p><p></p><p>I soon, however, grew accustomed to it, and my uneasi-
<lb break="no"/>ness wore off. It seemed to be his design rather to in-
<lb break="no"/>sinuate than directly to assert that, physically, he had
<lb/>not always been what he was—that a long series of neu-
<lb break="no"/>ralgic attacks had reduced him from a condition of more
<lb/>than usual personal beauty, to that which I saw. For
<lb/>many years past he had been attended by a physician,
<lb/>named Templeton—an old gentleman, perhaps seventy
<lb/>years of age—whom he had first encountered at Saratoga,
<lb/>and from whose attention, while there, he either receiv-
<lb break="no"/>ed, or fancied that he received, great benefit. The result
<lb/>was that Bedloe, who was wealthy, had made an ar-
<lb break="no"/>rangement with Doctor Templeton, by which the latter,
<lb/>in consideration of a liberal annual allowance, had con-
<lb break="no"/>sented to devote his time and medical experience exclu-
<lb break="no"/>sively to the care of the invalid.</p><p></p><p>Doctor Templeton had been a traveller in his younger
<lb/>days, and, at Paris, had become a convert, in great meas-
<lb break="no"/>ure, to the doctrines of Mesmer. It was altogether by
<lb/>means of magnetic remedies that he had succeeded in
<lb/>alleviating the acute pains of his patient; and this suc-
<lb break="no"/>cess had very naturally inspired the latter with a certain
<lb/>degree of confidence in the opinions from which the rem-
<lb break="no"/>edies had been educed. The Doctor, however, like all
<lb/>enthusiasts, had struggled hard to make a thorough con-
<lb break="no"/>vert of his pupil, and finally so far gained his point as to
<lb/>induce the sufferer to submit to numerous experiments.—
<lb/>By a frequent repetition of these, a result had arisen,
<lb/>which of late days has become so common as to attract
<lb/>little or no attention, but which, at the period of which
<lb/>I write, had very rarely been known in America. I mean
<lb/>to say, that between Doctor Templeton and Bedloe there
<lb/>had grown up, little by little, a very distinct and strongly
<lb/>marked rapport, or magnetic relation. I am not prepar-
<lb break="no"/>ed to assert, however, that this rapport extended beyond
<lb/>the limits of the simple sleep-producing power ; but this
<lb/>power itself had attained great intensity. At the first
<lb/>attempt to induce the magnetic somnolency, the mesmer-
<lb break="no"/>ist entirely failed. In the fifth or sixth he succeeded very
<lb/>partially, and after long continued effort. Only at the
<lb/>twelfth was the triumph complete. After this the will
<lb/>of the patient succumbed rapidly to that of the physi-
<lb break="no"/>cian, so that, when I first became acquainted with the
<lb/>two, sleep was brought about almost instantaneously, by
<lb/>the mere volition of the operator, even when the invalid
<lb/>was unaware of his presence. It is only now, in the year
<lb/>1845, when similar miracles are witnessed daily by thou-
<lb break="no"/>sands, that I dare venture to record this apparent impos-
<lb break="no"/>sibility as a matter of serious fact.</p><p><pb n="316"/>
</p><p>The temperature of Bedloe was, in the highest degree,
<lb/>sensitive, excitable, enthusiastic. His imagination was
<lb/>singularly vigorous and creative ; and no doubt it derived
<lb/>additional force from the habitual use of morphine, which
<lb/>he swallowed in great quantity, and without which he
<lb/>would have found it impossible to exist. It was his prac-
<lb break="no"/>tice to take a very large dose of it immediately after
<lb/>breakfast, each morning—or rather immediately after a
<lb/>cup of strong coffee, for he ate nothing in the forenoon—
<lb/>and then set forth alone, or attended only by a dog,
<lb/>upon a long ramble among the chain of wild and dreary
<lb/>hills that lie westward and southward of Charlottesville,
<lb/>and are there dignified by the title of the Ragged Moun-
<lb break="no"/>tains.</p><p></p><p>Upon a dim, warm, misty day, towards the close of
<lb/>November, and during the strange interregnum of the
<lb/>seasons which in America is termed the Indian Summer
<lb/>Mr. Bedloe departed, as usual, for the hills. The day
<lb/>passed, and still he did not return.</p><p></p><p>About eight o’clock at night, having become seriously
<lb/>alarmed at his protracted absence, we were about setting
<lb/>out in search of him, when he unexpectedly made his ap-
<lb break="no"/>pearance, in health no worse than usual, and in rather
<lb/>more than ordinary spirits. The account which he gave
<lb/>of his expedition, and of the events which had detained
<lb/>him, was a singular one indeed.</p><p></p><p>“You will remember,” said he, “that it was about
<lb/>nine in the morning when I left Charlottesville. I bent
<lb/>my steps immediately to the mountains, and, about ten,
<lb/>entered a gorge which was entirely new to me. I fol-
<lb break="no"/>lowed the windings of this pass with much interest.—
<lb/>The scenery which presented itself on all sides, although
<lb/>scarcely entitled to be called grand, had about it an in-
<lb break="no"/>describable, and to me, a delicious aspect of dreary deso-
<lb break="no"/>lation. The solitude seemed absolutely virgin. I could
<lb/>not help believing that the green sods and the gray rocks
<lb/>upon which I trod, had been trodden never before by the
<lb/>foot of a human being. So entirely secluded, and in fact
<lb/>inaccessible, except through a series of accidents, is the
<lb/>entrance of the ravine, that it is by no means impossible
<lb/>that I was indeed the first adventurer—the very first and
<lb/>sole adventurer who had ever penetrated its recesses.</p><p></p><p>“ The thick and peculiar mist, or smoke, which distin-
<lb break="no"/>guishes the Indian Summer, and which now hung heavi-
<lb break="no"/>ly over all objects, served, no doubt, to deepen the vague
<lb/>impressions which these objects created. So dense was
<lb/>this pleasant fog, that I could at no time see more than a
<lb/>dozen yards of the path before me. This path was ex-
<lb break="no"/>cessively sinuous, and as the sun could not be seen, I soon
<lb/>lost all idea of the direction in which I journeyed. In
<lb/>the meantime the morphine had its customary effect—
<lb/>that of enduing all the external world with an intensity
<lb/>of interest. In the quivering of a leaf—in the hue of a
<lb/>blade of grass—in the shape of a trefoil—in the humming
<lb/>of a bee—in the gleaming of a dew-drop—in the breath-
<lb break="no"/>ing of the wind—in the faint odors that came from the
<lb/>forest—there came a whole universe of suggestion—a gay
<lb/>and motly train of rhapsodical and immethodical thought.</p><p></p><p>“ Busied in this, I walked on for several hours, during
<lb/>which the mist deepened around me to so great an ex-
<lb break="no"/>tent, that at length I was reduced to an absolute groping
<lb/>of the way. And now an indescribable uneasiness pos-
<lb break="no"/>sessed me—a species of nervous hesitation and tremor.—
<lb/>I feared to tread, lest I should be precipitated into some
<lb/>abyss. I remembered, too, strange stories told about these
<lb/>Ragged Hills, and of the uncouth and fierce races of men
<lb/>who tenanted their groves and caverns. A thousand</p><p></p><p>vague fancies oppressed and disconcerted me—fancies
<lb/>the more distressing because vague. Very suddenly
<lb/>my attention was arrested by the loud beating of a
<lb/>drum.</p><p></p><p>“ My amazement was, of course, extreme. A drum in
<lb/>these hills was a thing unknown. I could not have been
<lb/>more surprised at the sound of the trump of the Arch-
<lb break="no"/>angel. But a new and still more astounding source of
<lb/>interest and perplexity arose. There came a wild rat-
<lb break="no"/>tling or jingling sound, as if of a bunch of large keys—
<lb/>and upon the instant a dusky-visaged and half-naked
<lb/>man rushed past me with a shriek. He came so close to
<lb/>my person that I felt his hot breath upon my face. He
<lb/>bore in one hand an instrument composed of an assemb-
<lb break="no"/>lage of steel rings, and shook them vigorously as he ran.
<lb/>Scarcely had he disappeared in the mist, before, panting
<lb/>after him, with open mouth and glaring eyes, there dart-
<lb break="no"/>ed a huge beast. I could not be mistaken in its charac-
<lb break="no"/>ter. It was a hyena.</p><p></p><p>“ The sight of this monster rather relieved than heigh-
<lb break="no"/>tened my terrors—for I now made sure that I dreamed,
<lb/>and endeavored to arouse myself to waking consciousness.
<lb/>I stepped boldly and briskly forward. I rubbed my eyes.
<lb/>I called aloud. I pinched my limbs. A small spring of
<lb/>water presented itself to my view, and here, stooping, I
<lb/>bathed my hands and my head and neck. This seemed
<lb/>to dissipate the equivocal sensations which had hitherto
<lb/>annoyed me. I arose, as I thought, a new man, and pro-
<lb break="no"/>ceeded steadily and complacently on my unknown way.</p><p></p><p>“ At length, quite overcome by exertion, and by a
<lb/>certain oppressive closeness of the atmosphere, I seated
<lb/>myself beneath a tree. Presently there came a feeble
<lb/>gleam of sunshine, and the shadow of the leaves of the
<lb/>tree fell faintly but definitely upon the grass. At this
<lb/>shadow I gazed wonderingly for many minutes. Its cha-
<lb break="no"/>racter stupified me with astonishment. I looked upward.
<lb/>The tree was a palm.</p><p></p><p>“ I now arose hurriedly, and in a state of fearful agita-
<lb break="no"/>tion—for the fancy that I dreamed would serve me no
<lb/>longer. I saw—I felt that I had perfect command of my
<lb/>senses—and these senses now brought to my soul a world
<lb/>of novel and singular sensation. The heat became all
<lb/>at once intolerable. A strange odor loaded the breeze.—
<lb/>A low continuous murmur, like that arising from a full,
<lb/>but gently-flowing river, came to my ears, intermingled
<lb/>with the peculiar hum of multitudinous human voices.</p><p></p><p>“ While I listened in an extremity of astonishment
<lb/>which I need not attempt to describe, a strong and brief
<lb/>gust of wind bore off the incumbent fog as if by the wand
<lb/>of an enchanter.</p><p></p><p>“I found myself at the foot of a high mountain, and
<lb/>looking down into a vast plain, through which wound a
<lb/>majestic river. On the margin of this river stood an
<lb/>Eastern-looking city, such as we read of in the Arabian
<lb/>Tales, but of a character even more singular than any
<lb/>there described. From my position, which was far above
<lb/>the level of the town, I could perceive its every nook and
<lb/>corner, as if delineated on a map. The streets seemed
<lb/>innumerable, and crossed each other irregularly in all di-
<lb break="no"/>rections, but were rather long winding alleys than streets,
<lb/>and absolutely swarmed with inhabitants. The houses
<lb/>were wildly picturesque. On every hand was a wilder-
<lb break="no"/>ness of balconies, of verandahs, of minarets, of shrines,
<lb/>and fantastically carved oriels. Bazaars abounded ; and
<lb/>in these were displayed rich wares in infinite variety and
<lb/>profusion—silks, muslins, the most dazzling cutlery, the
<lb/>most magnificent jewels and gems. Besides these things,</p><p><pb n="317"/>
</p><p>were seen, on all sides, banners and palanquins, litters
<lb/>with stately dames close veiled, elephants gorgeously
<lb/>caparisoned, idols grotesquely hewn, drums, banners and
<lb/>gongs, spears, silver and gilded maces. And amid the
<lb/>crowd, and the clamor, and the general intricacy and con-
<lb break="no"/>fusion—amid the million of black and yellow men, tur-
<lb break="no"/>baned and robed, and of flowing beard, there roamed a
<lb/>countless multitude of holy filleted bulls, while vast le-
<lb break="no"/>gions of the filthy but sacred ape clambered, chattering
<lb/>and shrieking, about the cornices of the mosques, or clung
<lb/>to the minarets and oriels. From the swarming streets
<lb/>to the banks of the river, there descended innumerable
<lb/>flights of steps leading to bathing places, while the river
<lb/>itself seemed to force a passage with difficulty through
<lb/>the vast fleets of deeply-burthened ships that far and wide
<lb/>encumbered its surface. Beyond the limits of the city
<lb/>arose, in frequent majestic groups, the palm and the
<lb/>cocoa, with other gigantic and wierd trees of vast age ;
<lb/>and here and there might be seen a field of rice, the
<lb/>thatched hut of a peasant, a tank, a stray temple, a gyp-
<lb break="no"/>sy camp, or a solitary graceful maiden taking her way,
<lb/>with a pitcher upon her head, to the banks of the magni-
<lb break="no"/>ficent river.</p><p></p><p>“ You will say now, of course, that I dreamed; but not so.
<lb/>What I saw—what I heard—what I felt—what I thought
<lb/>—had about it nothing of the unmistakeable idiosyncrasy
<lb/>of the dream. All was rigorously self-consistent. At
<lb/>first, doubting that I was really awake, I entered into a
<lb/>series of tests, which soon convinced me that I really
<lb/>was. Now, when one dreams, and, in the dream, sus-
<lb break="no"/>pects that he dreams, the suspicion never fails to confirm
<lb/>itself, and the sleeper is almost immediately aroused.—
<lb/>Thus Novalis errs not in saying that ‘ we are near wak-
<lb break="no"/>ing when we dream that we dream.’ Had the vision
<lb/>occured to me as I describe it, without my suspecting it
<lb/>as a dream, then a dream it might absolutely have been,
<lb/>but, occurring as it did, and suspected and tested as it
<lb/>was, I am forced to class it among other phenomena.”</p><p></p><p>“ In this I am not sure that you are wrong,” observed
<lb/>Dr. Templeton, “ but proceed. You arose and descended
<lb/>into the city.”</p><p></p><p>“ I arose,” continued Bedloe, regarding the Doctor with
<lb/>an air of profound astonishment, “ I arose, as you say,
<lb/>and descended into the city. On my way, I fell in with
<lb/>an immense populace, crowding, through every avenue,
<lb/>all in the same direction, and exhibiting in every action
<lb/>the wildest excitement. Very suddenly, and by some in-
<lb break="no"/>conceivable impulse, I became intensely imbued with per-
<lb break="no"/>sonal interest in what was going on. I seemed to feel
<lb/>that I had an important part to play, without exactly un-
<lb break="no"/>derstanding what it was. Against the crowd which en-
<lb break="no"/>vironed me, however, I experienced a deep sentiment of
<lb/>animosity. I shrank from amid them, and, swiftly, by a
<lb/>circuitous path, reached and entered the city. Here all
<lb/>was the wildest tumult and contention. A small party
<lb/>of men, clad in garments half-Indian half European, and
<lb/>officered by gentlemen in a uniform partly British, were
<lb/>engaged, at great odds, with the swarming rabble of the
<lb/>alleys. I joined the weaker party, arming myself with
<lb/>the weapons of a fallen officer, and fighting I knew not
<lb/>whom with the nervous ferocity of despair. We were
<lb/>soon overpowered by numbers, and driven to seek refuge
<lb/>in a species of kiosk. Here we barricaded ourselves,
<lb/>and, for the present, were secure. From a loop-hole near
<lb/>the summit of the kiosk, I perceived a vast crowd, in fu-
<lb break="no"/>rious agitation, surrounding and assaulting a gay palace
<lb/>that overhung the river. Presently, from an upper win-</p><p></p><p>dow of this palace, there descended an effeminate-look-
<lb break="no"/>ing person, by means of a string made of the turbans of
<lb/>his attendants. A boat was at hand, in which he escap-
<lb break="no"/>ed to the opposite bank of the river.</p><p></p><p>And now a new object took possession of my soul. I
<lb/>spoke a few hurried but energetic words to my compan-
<lb break="no"/>ions, and, having succeeded in gaining over a few of them
<lb/>to my purpose, made a frantic sally from the kiosk. We
<lb/>rushed amid the crowd that surrounded it. They retreat-
<lb break="no"/>ed, at first, before us. They rallied, fought madly, and
<lb/>retreated again. In the mean time we were borne far
<lb/>from the kiosk, and became bewildered and entangled
<lb/>among the narrow streets of tall overhanging houses, into
<lb/>the recesses of which the sun had never been able to
<lb/>shine. The rabble pressed impetuously upon us, harass-
<lb break="no"/>ing us with their spears, and overwhelming us with
<lb/>flights of arrows. These latter were very remarkable,
<lb/>and resembled in some respects the writhing creese of
<lb/>the Malay. They were made to imitate the body of a
<lb/>creeping serpent, and were long and black, with a pois-
<lb break="no"/>oned barb. One of them struck me upon the right tem-
<lb break="no"/>ple. I reeled and fell. An instantaneous and deadly
<lb/>sickness seized me. I struggled—I gasped—I died.”</p><p></p><p>“ You will hardly persist now,” said I, smiling, “ that
<lb/>the whole of your adventure was not a dream. You are
<lb/>not prepared to maintain that you are dead ?”</p><p></p><p>When I said these words, I of course expected some
<lb/>lively sally from Bedloe in reply ; but, to my astonish-
<lb break="no"/>ment, he hesitated, trembled, became fearfully pallid, and
<lb/>remained silent. I looked towards Templeton. He sat
<lb/>erect and rigid in his chair—his teeth chattered, and his
<lb/>eyes were starting from their sockets. “ Proceed !” he
<lb/>at length said hoarsely to Bedloe.</p><p></p><p>“For many minutes,” continued the latter, “ my sole
<lb/>sentiment—my sole feeling—was that of darkness and
<lb/>nonentity, with the consciousness of death. At length,
<lb/>there seemed to pass a violent and sudden shock through
<lb/>my soul, as if of electricity. With it came the sense of
<lb/>elasticity and of light. This latter I felt—not saw. In
<lb/>an instant I seemed to rise from the ground. But I had
<lb/>no bodily, no visible, audible, or palpable presence. The
<lb/>crowd had departed. The tumult had ceased. The city
<lb/>was in comparative repose. Beneath me lay my corpse,
<lb/>with the arrow in my temple, the whole head greatly
<lb/>swollen and disfigured. But all these things I felt—not
<lb/>saw. I took interest in nothing. Even the corpse seem-
<lb break="no"/>ed a matter in which I had no concern. Volition I had
<lb/>none, but appeared to be impelled into motion, and flitted
<lb/>buoyantly out of the city, retracing the circuitous path
<lb/>by which I had entered it. When I had attained that
<lb/>point of the ravine in the mountains, at which I had en-
<lb break="no"/>countered the hyena, I again experienced a shock as of
<lb/>a galvanic battery ; the sense of weight, of volition, of
<lb/>substance, returned. I became my original self, and bent
<lb/>my steps eagerly homewards—but the past had not lost
<lb/>the vividness of the real—and not now, even for an in-
<lb break="no"/>stant, can I compel my understanding to regard it as a
<lb/>dream.”</p><p></p><p>“ Nor was it,” said Templeton, with an air of deep
<lb/>solemnity, “yet it would be difficult to say how other-
<lb break="no"/>wise it should be termed. Let us suppose only, that the
<lb/>soul of the man of to-day is upon the verge of some stupen-
<lb break="no"/>dous psychal discoveries. Let us content ourselves with
<lb/>this supposition. For the rest I have some explanation
<lb/>to make. Here is a water-colour drawing, which I should
<lb/>have shown you before, but which an unaccountable sen-
<lb break="no"/>iment of horror has hitherto prevented me from showing.”</p><p><pb n="318"/>
</p><p>We looked at the picture which he presented. I saw
<lb/>nothing in it of an extraordinary character ; but its effect
<lb/>upon Bedloe was prodigious. He nearly fainted as he
<lb/>gazed. And yet it was but a miniature portrait—a mi-
<lb break="no"/>raculously accurate one, to be sure—of his own very re-
<lb break="no"/>markable features. At least this was my thought as I
<lb/>regarded it.</p><p></p><p>“ You will perceive,” said Templeton, “ the date of
<lb/>this picture—it is here, scarcely visible, in this corner—
<lb/>1780. In this year was the portrait taken. It is the like-
<lb break="no"/>ness of a dead friend—a Mr. Oldeb—to whom I became
<lb/>much attached at Calcutta, during the administration of
<lb/>Warren Hastings. I was then only twenty years old.—
<lb/>When I first saw you, Mr. Bedloe, at Saratoga, it was
<lb/>the miraculous similarity which existed between yourself
<lb/>and the painting, which induced me to accost you, to
<lb/>seek your friendship, and to bring about those arrange-
<lb break="no"/>ments which resulted in my becoming your constant
<lb/>companion. In accomplishing this point, I was urged
<lb/>partly, and perhaps principally, by a regretful memory
<lb/>of the deceased, but also, in part, by an uneasy, and not
<lb/>altogether horrorless curiosity respecting yourself.</p><p></p><p>“ In your detail of the vision which presented itself to
<lb/>you amid the hills, you have described, with the mi-
<lb break="no"/>nutest accuracy, the Indian city of Benares, upon the
<lb/>Holy River. The riots, the combats, the massacre, were
<lb/>the actual events of the insurrection of Cheyte Sing,
<lb/>which took place in 1780, when Hastings was put in im-
<lb break="no"/>minent peril of his life. The man escaping by the string
<lb/>of turbans, was Cheyte Sing himself. The party in the
<lb/>kiosk were sepoys and British officers, headed by Hast-
<lb break="no"/>ings. Of this party I was one, and did all I could to
<lb/>prevent the rash and fatal sally of the officer who fell,
<lb/>in the crowded alleys, by the poisoned arrow of a Ben-
<lb break="no"/>galee. That officer was my dearest friend. It was
<lb/>Oldeb. You will perceive by these manuscripts,” (here
<lb/>the speaker produced a note-book in which several pages
<lb/>appeared to have been freshly written) “ that at the very
<lb/>period in which you fancied these things amid the hills,</p><p>I was engaged in detailing them upon paper here at
home.”
In about a week after this conversation, the following
paragraphs appeared in a Charlottesville paper.
</p><p>“We have the painful duty of announcing the death
<lb/>of Mr. Augustus Bedlo, a gentleman whose amiable
<lb/>manners and many virtues have long endeared him to
<lb/>the citizens of Charlottesville.</p><p></p><p>“Mr. B., for some years past, has been subject to neur-
<lb break="no"/>algia, which has often threatened to terminate fatally ;
<lb/>but this can be regarded only as the mediate cause of
<lb/>his decease. The proximate cause was one of especial
<lb/>singularity. In an excursion to the Ragged Mountains,
<lb/>a few days since, a slight cold and fever were contract-
<lb break="no"/>ed, attended with great determination of blood to the
<lb/>head. To relieve this, Dr. Templeton resorted to topical
<lb/>bleeding. Leeches were applied to the temples. In a
<lb/>fearfully brief period the patient died, when it appeared
<lb/>that, in the jar containing the leeches, had been intro-
<lb break="no"/>duced, by accident, one of the venomous vermicular sang-
<lb break="no"/>sues which are now and then found in the neighboring
<lb/>ponds. This creature fastened itself upon a small artery
<lb/>in the right temple. Its close resemblance to the medi-
<lb break="no"/>cinal leech caused the mistake to be overlooked until too
<lb/>late.</p><p></p><p>“ N. B. The poisonous sangsue of Charlottesville may
<lb/>always be distinguished from the medicinal leech by its
<lb/>blackness, and especially by its writhing or vermicular
<lb/>motions, which very nearly resemble those of a snake.”</p><p></p><p>I was speaking with the editor of the paper in ques-
<lb break="no"/>tion, upon the topic of this remarkable accident, when it
<lb/>occurred to me to ask how it happened that the name of
<lb/>the deceased had been given as Bedlo.</p><p></p><p>“ I presume,” said I, “ you have authority for this
<lb/>spelling, but I have always supposed the name to be writ-
<lb break="no"/>ten with an e at the end.”</p><p></p><p>“ Authority ?—no,” he replied. “ It is a mere typo-
<lb break="no"/>graphical error. The name is Bedlo with an e, all the
<lb/>world over, and I never knew it to be spelt otherwise in
<lb/>my life.”</p><p></p><p>“ Then,” said I mutteringly, as I turned upon my heel,
<lb/>“ then indeed has it come to pass that one truth is
<lb/>stranger than any fiction—for Bedlo, without the e, what
<lb/>is it but Oldeb conversed ? And this man tells me it is
<lb/>a typographical error.”	Edgar A. Poe.</p><p>To ---------
“ In Heaven a spirit doth dwell,
Whose heart-strings are a lute.”
I cannot tell the world how thrills my heart
To every touch that flies thy lyre along;
How the wild Nature and the wondrous Art,
Blend into Beauty in thy passionate song—
But this I know—in thine enchanted slumbers,

Taught thee the music of his own sweet numbers,
And tuned—to chord with his—thy glorious lyre!

Art-Singing and Heart-Singing.*
</p><p>Great is the power of Music over a people ! As for
<lb/>us of America, we have long enough followed obedient
<lb/>and child-like in the track of the Old World. We have
<lb/>received her tenors and her buffos, her operatic troupes
<lb/>and her vocalists, of all grades and complexions ; listened
<lb/>to and applauded the songs made for a different state of
<lb/>society—made, perhaps, by royal genius, but made to
<lb/>please royal ears likewise ; and it is time that such lis-
<lb break="no"/>tening and receiving should cease. The subtlest spirit
<lb/>of a nation is expressed through its music—and the mu-
<lb break="no"/>sic acts reciprocally upon the nation’s very soul. Its ef-
<lb break="no"/>fects may not be seen in a day, or a year, and yet these
<lb/>effects are potent invisibly. They enter into religious
<lb/>feelings—they tinge the manners and morals—they are
<lb/>active even in the choice of legislators and high magis-
<lb break="no"/>trates. Tariff can be varied to fit circumstances—bad
<lb/>laws obliterated and good ones formed—those enactments
<lb/>which relate to commerce or national policy, built up or
<lb/>taken away, stretched or contracted, to suit the will of
<lb/>the government for the time being. But no human pow-
<lb break="no"/>er can thoroughly suppress the spirit which lives in na-
<lb break="no"/>tional lyrics, and sounds in the favorite melodies sung by
<lb/>high and low.</p><p></p><p>There are two kinds of singing—heart-singing and art-
<lb break="no"/>singing. That which touches the souls and sympathies
<lb/>of other communities may have no effect here—unless it
<lb/>appeals to the throbbings of the great heart of humanity</p><p></p><p>* The author desires us to say, for him, that he pretends to no
<lb/>scientific knowledge of music. He merely claims to appreciate
<lb/>so much of it (a sadly disdained department, just now) as affects,
<lb/>in the language ol the deacons, “ the natural heart of man.” It is
<lb/>scarcely necessary to add that we agree with our correspondent
<lb/>throughout.	Ed. B. J.</p><p><pb n="319"/>
</p><p>itself—pictures love, hope, or mirth in their comprehen-
<lb break="no"/>sive aspect. But nearly every nation has its peculiarities
<lb/>and its idioms, which make its best intellectual efforts
<lb/>dearest to itself alone, so that hardly any thing which
<lb/>comes to us in the music and songs of the Old World, is
<lb/>strictly good and fitting to our own nation.</p><p></p><p>With all honor and glory to the land of the olive and
<lb/>the vine, fair-skied Italy—with no turning up of noses at
<lb/>Germany, France, or England—we humbly demand
<lb/>whether we have not run after their beauties long enough.</p><p></p><p>“ At last we have found it!” exclaimed we, some nights
<lb/>since, at the conclusion of the performances by the Che-
<lb break="no"/>ney Family, in Niblo’s Saloon. At last we have found,
<lb/>and heard, and seen something original and beautiful in
<lb/>the way of American musical execution. Never hav-
<lb break="no"/>ing been present at any of the Hutchinsons’ Concerts,
<lb/>(the Cheneys, we are told, are after the same tok-
<lb break="no"/>en,) the elegant simplicity of this style took us com-
<lb break="no"/>pletely by surprise, and our gratification was inexpressi-
<lb break="no"/>ble. This, said we in our heart, is the true method
<lb/>which must become popular in the United States—which
<lb/>must supplant the stale, second-hand, foreign method,
<lb/>with its flourishes, its ridiculous sentimentality, its anti-
<lb break="no"/>republican spirit, and its sycophantic influence, tainting
<lb/>the young taste of the republic.</p><p></p><p>The Cheney young men are such brown-faced, stout-
<lb break="no"/>shouldered fellows as you will see in almost any Ameri-
<lb break="no"/>can church, in a country village, of a Sunday. The girl
<lb/>is strangely simple, even awkward, in her ways. Or it
<lb/>may possibly be that she disdains the usual clap-trap of
<lb/>smiles, hand-kissing, and dancing-school bends. To our
<lb/>taste, there is something refreshing about all this. We
<lb/>are absolutely sick to nausea of the patent-leather, curl-
<lb break="no"/>ed-hair, “japonicadom” style. The Cheneys are as
<lb/>much ahead of it as real teeth are ahead of artificial
<lb/>ones—even those which Dodge, (nature-rival, as he is,)
<lb/>sent to the late Fair. We beg these young Yankees to
<lb/>keep their manners plain alway. The sight of them, as
<lb/>they are, puts one in mind of health and fresh air in the
<lb/>country, at sunrise—the dewy, earthy fragrance that
<lb/>comes up then in the moisture, and touches the nostrils
<lb/>more gratefnlly than all the perfumes of the most ingen:
<lb/>ious chemist.</p><p></p><p>These hints we throw out rather as suggestive of a
<lb/>train of thought to other and more deliberate thinkers
<lb/>than we—and not as the criticisms of a musical connois-
<lb break="no"/>seur. If they have pith in them, we have not much
<lb/>doubt others will|carry them out. If not, we at least know
<lb/>they are written in that true wish for benefitting the sub-
<lb break="no"/>ject spoken of, which should characterize all such es-

TO HER WHO CAN UNDERSTAND THEM.
Air—To ladies’ eyes a round—boy.
The song that o’er me hovered
In summer’s hour—in summer’s hour
To day with joy has covered
My winter bower—my winter bower.
Blest be the lips that breathe it!
As mine have been—as mine have been
When pressed, in dreams, beneath it,
To hers unseen—to hers unseen.
And may her heart, wherever
Its hope may be—its hope may be—
Beat happily, though never
To beat for me—to beat for me!
Is she spirit, given
One hour to earth—one hour to earth,
To bring me dreams from heaven
</p><p>Her place of birth—her place of birth?
<lb/>Or minstrel maiden—hidden
<lb/>Like cloistered nun—like cloistered nun—</p><p></p><p>A bud, a flower forbidden
<lb/>To air and sun—to air and sun?
<lb/>For had I power to summon
<lb/>With harp divine—with harp divine—</p><p>The angel, or the woman,
The last were mine—the last were mine!
</p><p>If earth-born beauty’s fingers
<lb/>Awaked the lay, awaked the lay
<lb/>Whose echoed music lingers
<lb/>Around my way, around my way—</p><p>Where smiles the hearth she blesses
With voice and eye, with voice and eye?
Where binds the Night her tresses,
</p><p>When sleep is nigh, when sleep is nigh?
<lb/>Is Fashion’s bleak, cold mountain
<lb/>Her bosom’s throne, her bosom’s throne?
<lb/>Or Love’s green vale and fountain,</p><p>With one alone, with one alone?
</p><p>Why ask, why seek a treasure
<lb/>Like her I sing, like her I sing?
<lb/>Her name, nor pain nor pleasure
<lb/>To me should bring, to me should bring.</p><p>Love must not grieve nor gladden
My thoughts of snow, my thoughts of snow;
Nor woman soothe or sadden
My hours below, my hours below.
Before a worldlier altar
I’ve knelt too long, I’ve knelt too long;
And if my footsteps falter,
’Tis but in song, ’tis but in song.
Nor would I break the vision
Young fancies frame, young fancies frame,
That decks, with stars elysian,
A poet’s name, a poet’s name—
</p><p>For her, whose gentle spirit
<lb/>Such dreams sublime, such dreams sublime
<lb/>Gives hues they do not merit
<lb/>To sons of rhyme, to sons of rhyme.</p><p>But place the proudest near her,
Whate’er his pen, whate’er his pen,
She’ll say—(be mute who hear her!)
“ Mere mortal men—mere mortal men!”
Yet though unseen, unseeing,
We meet and part, we meet and part,
Be still my worshipped being, 
In mind and heart, in mind and heart.
And bid thy song that found me,
My minstrel maid, my minstrel maid!
Be winter’s sunbeam round me,
And summer’s shade, and summer’s shade.
I could not gaze upon thee,
And dare thy spell, and dare thy spell—
And when a happier won thee,
Thus bid farewell, thus bid farewell!
Fitz Greene Halleck.

Western Clearings. By Mrs. C. M. Kirkland, Author
of “A New Home"  etc.
</p><p>Very few American books have produced as widely ex-
<lb break="no"/>tended a sensation as Mrs. Kirkland’s “New Home.”—
<lb/>The cause of this lay not merely in its picturesque and
<lb/>amusing descriptions, its fresh and racy humor, or its
<lb/>animated individual portraitures. It was the truth of its
<lb/>delineations that constituted its great charm. The West
<lb/>—the wild, rich, independent, glorious West—has been
<lb/>a field hitherto untrodden by the sketcher or the novelist.
<lb/>Some few brief glimpses of character we had, strange to
<lb/>sojourners in the civilized East, in the works of other
<lb/>writers ; but to Mrs. Kirkland alone we owe our acquain-
<lb break="no"/>tance with the home and home-life of the backwoodsman.
<lb/>She has represented scenes that could have occurred no-
<lb break="no"/>where else, with a fidelity and vigor that show her pic-
<lb break="no"/>tures taken from the very life; with a fine chisel that cut
<lb/>breath itself, she has placed before us the veritable set-
<lb break="no"/>tlers of the forest, with all their peculiarities, national
<lb/>and individual; their free and fearless spirit, their home-
<lb break="no"/>ly, utilitarian views ; their shrewdness, and sharp look-
<lb break="no"/>ing out for self-interest; their thrifty care, and inventions
<lb/>multiform; their coarseness of manner, united with real
<lb/>delicacy and substantial kindness, when their sympathies
<lb/>are called into action; in a word, with all the character-
<lb break="no"/>istics that stamp the “Yankee,” in a region where the
<lb/>salient points of character are not smoothed down by con-
<lb break="no"/>tact with society, as an original creation among men.—
<lb/>So life-like, or rather so living, have been the represen-
<lb break="no"/>tations of Mrs. Kirkland, that they have not only been
<lb/>recognized universally abroad, but appropriated at home
<lb/>as individual portraits, by many who have been disposed
<lb/>to plead trumpet-tongued, if not like angels, against what
<lb/>they imagined “ the deep damnation of their taking off."
<lb/>This was to be expected, and inevitable.</p><p></p><p>It will readily be seen that a minute and truthful pic-
<lb break="no"/>ture of Western life could never be given in any grave his-
<lb break="no"/>tory half so well as in the form of stories, where the per-
<lb break="no"/>sons are suffered to develope themselves. This method
<lb/>has been in part adopted by Mrs. Kirkland, in her former
<lb/>sketches of Forest Life ; and more entirely in the present
<lb/>volume. “ Western Clearings” is a collection of graphic
<lb/>Tales, each illustrative of the customs, manners and ideas
<lb/>of a peculiar people, and descriptive of a new and unci-
<lb break="no"/>vilized, but great and growing country. We can only
<lb/>glance at a few of these. “ The Land Fever,” is a
<lb/>story of the wild days when the madness of specula-
<lb break="no"/>tion in land was at its height. Both it, and “ The
<lb/>Ball at Thram’s Huddle,” are richly characteristic.—
<lb/>Only those who have had the fortune to visit or live
<lb/>in these newly settled regions, can enjoy such pic-
<lb break="no"/>tures to the full. “ Chances and Changes,” and “ Love
<lb/>vs. Aristocracy,” are more regularly constructed Tales,
<lb/>with the “ universal passion” for the moving power, but
<lb/>colored with glowing hues of the West. “The Bee-tree”
<lb/>exhibits a striking, but too numerous class among the
<lb/>settlers, and marks, also, the length and breadth of the
<lb/>bitterness that grows out of an unprosperous condition.</p><p></p><p>“Ambuscades,” and “ Half-lengths from Life,” we re-
<lb break="no"/>member as the most piquant and delightful of the stories
<lb/>in an annual a year or two since, to which the book owed,
<lb/>according to the confession of the publishers, a large sale
<lb/>among the conscious and pen-dreading Western people
<lb/>themselves. Tom Oliver, in the first mentioned Tale, is
<lb/>admirably sketched “ Half-lengths from Life,” has the</p><p></p><p>heart’s core and spirit of a backwoods life, on the trying
<lb/>subject of caste. “ The Schoolmaster’s Progress,” is un-
<lb break="no"/>rivalled in truth and humor. The Western Schoolmas-
<lb break="no"/>ter—that walking nondescript—that stiff, solitary, unique
<lb/>figure in the drama of a new settlement—sublimely ming-
<lb break="no"/>led with the associations of our school-days—occupying
<lb/>a middle position between “ our folks” and “ company,”
<lb/>where he “ boarded round”—is depicted to the very life.
<lb/>The individual cannot fail to be recognized as the repre-
<lb break="no"/>sentative of a class. The occupation, indeed, always
<lb/>seems to mould those engaged in it into the same like-
<lb break="no"/>ness. They all, like Master Horner, “know well what
<lb/>belongs to the pedagogical character, and that facial
<lb/>solemnity stands high on the list of indispensable qualifi-
<lb break="no"/>cations.” The spelling school, also, is a new country
<lb/>feature which we owe thanks to our fair author for re-
<lb break="no"/>cording. How important that such good old customs
<lb/>should be preserved on the speaking page, when hereaf-
<lb break="no"/>ter they may lose their peculiarity, if they be not effaced
<lb/>from the memory, in the march of improvement!</p><p></p><p>“An Embroidered Fact,” is a narration of actual events,
<lb/>described to the author by the hero himself. We like it
<lb/>less than the other stories. The incidents are singular—
<lb/>but not illustrative of the country. The same may be
<lb/>said of the tragic occurrences in “Bitter Fruits from
<lb/>Chance-sown Seeds but this last abounds in capital
<lb/>touches of character. All the horrors of the Tale are
<lb/>caused by the suspicion of pride ; an accusation, says the
<lb/>author, as destructive at the West as that of witchcraft
<lb/>in olden times, or the cry of mad dog at the present day.</p><p></p><p>“Western Clearings,” we are confident, will sustain
<lb/>the author’s high reputation as one of the most original
<lb/>and accomplished of American writers. Even her style
<lb/>has a touch of Western freshness that renders it, and her
<lb/>arch, playful satire, especially charming. The imagina-
<lb break="no"/>tive or creative faculty is possessed by Mrs. Kirkland in
<lb/>a high degree; but she is unrivalled in power of delinea-
<lb break="no"/>tion; and in a marvellous felicity of expression, whereby
<lb/>a world of meaning or humor is convey ed in some brief
<lb/>phrase, she is approached by no female writer in the
<lb/>country.</p><p>
America and the American People. By Frederick Von
Raumer, Professor of History in the University of
Berlin, etc, etc. Translated from the German by
William W. Turner. New-York; J. &amp; G. H. Lang-
ley.
</p><p>We cannot better preface the few words we have to
<lb/>say of this book than by the citation of a passage in
<lb/>Professor Turner’s introduction.</p><p></p><p>His opinions on the whole respecting the institutions, the past
<lb/>history, and the future prospects of this country, are in the highest
<lb/>degree favorable ; and whenever he allows himself to find fault,
<lb/>which is but seldom, he does it with evident reluctance, and with
<lb/>the air of a friend whose admonitions are wholesome, not with
<lb/>the bitterness of an enemy. The comparisons too, which he makes
<lb/>between many of the American institutions and the corresponding
<lb/>institutions of Europe, will be found useful and instructive. One
<lb/>virtue of his will not be the less esteemed on account of its rarity
<lb/>among writers in this country; and that is, that he has at least en-
<lb break="no"/>deavored to make himself well acquainted with what he has under-</p><p>taken to write about. He has also shown great and commendable 
carefulness in every instance, not to violate the privileges of a guest 
by exposing to the world the confidences of private and social in-
tercourse,--a proceeding which some writers on both sides of the 
water might imitate with advantage. 
</p><p>	Elsewhere the translator well observes that it is ra-
<lb break="no"/>ther the subjectivity than the objectivity of the book
<lb/>that will claim the attention of readers in this country</p><p><pb n="321"/>
</p><p>—that Americans will not resort to a work of this kind,
<lb/>written by a foreigner, and which treats of such a va-
<lb break="no"/>riety of delicate and different topics, to obtain minute
<lb/>information on matters of fact.</p><p></p><p>The Baron himself, with a genuine modesty, admits
<lb/>that he is not unaware of his incapacity for such detail.
<lb/>“Should my book reach America,” he says, “I request
<lb/>my readers there not to forget that it is especially in-
<lb break="no"/>tended for Germany and that it can offer nothing new to
<lb/>the well-informed inhabitants of the United States.”</p><p></p><p>These considerations and admissions should be care-
<lb break="no"/>fully borne in mind by every American who reads the
<lb/>book. Its commendable features are candor, evident de-
<lb break="no"/>sire for truth, freedom from prejudice, comprehensive-
<lb break="no"/>ness, and masterly breadth of generalization.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps there are no points at which we have greater
<lb/>need of making allowance for the foreigner’s imperfect
<lb/>means of information in detail, than those which concern
<lb/>the state of our National Literature. Were we to say,
<lb/>in round terms, that Professor Von Rammer has set forth
<lb/>with accuracy not one fact in relation to American letters,
<lb/>we fear that we should not be very far from the truth.
<lb/>The German who is so rash as to estimate our condition by
<lb/>what he here reads, will find himself in what may be
<lb/>termed a high state of information.</p><p></p><p>“ The greater American periodicals or critical re-
<lb break="no"/>views” says the Baron, among other things, “ distinguish
<lb/>themselves by propriety, moderation, and dignity ; they
<lb/>display an accurate knowledge of all sciences and often
<lb/>contain criticisms which are masterly both in form and
<lb/>substance.”</p><p></p><p>Of the “propriety” we are not prepared to speak—
<lb/>and the “ dignity” will do—but the “moderation” (so far
<lb/>at least as concerns the Down-East Review) must have
<lb/>reference to the applause or attention bestowed upon
<lb/>those insignificant indivduals who have the misfortune
<lb/>to reside out of the limits of Massachusetts.</p><p>“Authors of really able productions” continues the
Baron, “ are liberally rewarded in America.”
</p><p>Some one has informed the traveller, no doubt, that
<lb/>Mr. Prescott received six thousand dollars for “ The
<lb/>Conquest of Mexico”—for this is the one brilliant point
<lb/>usually cited in defence of the liberality of American
<lb/>publishers. Had the Professor made farther inquiry he
<lb/>would have found that Mr. Prescott was engaged for
<lb/>many years at his work, and that he expended for the
<lb/>necessary books and other materials a large sum :—
<lb/>the compensation thus afforded him, amounting in the
<lb/>end to little more than any common scavenger might
<lb/>have earned in the same period, upon our highways.</p><p></p><p>The most really curious portion, however, of the com-
<lb break="no"/>ments on American Literature, is to be found in the fol-
<lb break="no"/>lowing passage:</p><p></p><p>The richest or at least the most prolific department of poetry is
<lb/>the lyric. But as in thousands of years there have been but one
<lb/>Pindar and one Horace, (although every spring puts forth count-
<lb break="no"/>less pleasing yet mostly perishable lyric blossoms,) it is performing
<lb/>a valuable service, when a man of taste and information makes a
<lb/>suitable, well assorted selection, and guides the friend of poetry in
<lb/>his ramble through those groves, from which he might otherwise
<lb/>be deterred by their immensity. Such service has been rendered
<lb/>by Mr. Griswold, in his Poets and Poetry of America.</p><p></p><p>We have heard it asserted that it was out of the pow-
<lb break="no"/>er of any such book as that of Mr. Griswold to effect
<lb/>either good or evil—but we think that the evil is here
<lb/>sufficiently obvious. His book is the largest one of its
<lb/>kind. A distinguished foreigner very naturally supposes
<lb/>it the best. He is not in condition to consider or to com-</p><p></p><p>prehend the innumerable petty arts by which, in Ameri-
<lb break="no"/>ca, a dexterous quack may force even the most contempt-
<lb break="no"/>ible work into notoriety and consequent circulation. The
<lb/>foreigner’s opinions, and through him the opinions of
<lb/>his countrymen, are thus in danger of being based (at
<lb/>least for a time) upon a foundation, for which “ frothy”
<lb/>is far too solid—far too respectable a term. If Dr.
<lb/>Griswold’s book is really to be received as a fair re-
<lb break="no"/>presentation of our poetical literature, then are we in a
<lb/>very lamentable—or rather in a very ridiculous condi-
<lb break="no"/>tion indeed.</p><p></p><p>Following such authority, Professor Von Raumer quotes
<lb/>in especial, “ The Old Man’s Carousal” by Paulding!
<lb/>and a lyric (the name of which we forget) by the Right
<lb/>Reverend Bishop Doane!</p><p></p><p>We have been much surprised to find, in the Trans-
<lb break="no"/>lator’s Preface, no acknowledgment of his indebtedness
<lb/>to those who aided him in his very difficult task—to
<lb/>Mr. Kirkland, for example, and to the accomplished
<lb/>Mrs. Ellett—who, between them, prepared nearly, if not
<lb/>quite, one half of the book. The omission, however,
<lb/>may either have been accidental or have arisen from
<lb/>some motives of publishing policy—motives which, we
<lb/>admit, are now and then exceedingly difficult to under-
<lb break="no"/>stand.</p><p>The Philosophy of Mystery. By Walter Cooper Dendy,
</p><p>Fellow and Honorary Librarian of the Medical Socie-
<lb break="no"/>ty of London, etc. etc. New York: Harper and Bro-
<lb break="no"/>thers.</p><p></p><p>This really beautiful volume is No. 3 of Harper’s New
<lb/>Miscellany. The style of this series is especially good;
<lb/>the type is of proper size, the paper unusually fine, and the
<lb/>binding (in boards, with embossed muslin,) particularly
<lb/>neat and tasteful. The number of pages in a volume is
<lb/>about 450. In literary character, the books of this se-
<lb break="no"/>ries will tend towards the utile rather than the dulce—
<lb/>combining the two as far as possible.</p><p></p><p>“ The Philosophy of Mystery” is an exceedingly able
<lb/>work—far better, we think, than the “ Natural Magic”
<lb/>of Brewster—a book of identical purpose carried out in a
<lb/>totally different way. The “ Natural Magic” is the more
<lb/>ratiocinative—Mr. Dendy’s essay the more poetical, the
<lb/>more imaginative, and to us the more interesting. Sel-
<lb break="no"/>dom, indeed, have we read any book which, for the time,
<lb/>so thoroughly engrossed us.</p><p>Wiley &amp; Putman's Foreign Library. Nos. 3 and 4. The

<lb/>It is not as a tourist, however, or as a sketcher, that Vic-

<lb/>Not that we object to Willisism—in Willis.</p><p>We quote a portion of the Preface:
</p><p>About a year ago, a girl sat down in her own quiet little room,
<lb/>and, for very idleness, without object and without plan, produced
<lb/>plan, produced a letter, which, the next week, found its way into
<lb/>the New York Mirror. It was the first letter in this collection;
<lb/>and Mr. Willis, one of the editors, after various speculations con-
<lb break="no"/>cerning the author, added—</p><p></p><p>“ Well—we give in!—On condition that you are under twenty-
<lb break="no"/>five, and that you will wear a rose (recognizably) in your boddice
<lb/>the first day you appear in Broadway with the hat and 'balzarine,’
<lb/>we will pay the bills. Write us, thereafter, a sketch of ‘ Bel’ and
<lb/>and yourself, as cleverly done as this letter, and you may 'snug-
<lb break="no"/>gle down’ on the sofa, and consider us paid, and the public charmed
<lb/>with you.”</p><p></p><p>A reply was given by way of carrying out the frolic still father,
<lb/>accompanied by the sketch of “ The Cousins,” which appeared in
<lb/>the Mirror immediately after. These met with such a kind recep-
<lb break="no"/>tion, that the pen became a more familiar thing than formerly in
<lb/>those fingers, and so, behold upon them an indelible ink-mark.</p><p></p><p>We presume that there are not more than one or two of

</p><p>Some person has had the audacity to send us a book
<lb/>thus entitled, with a slip of paper containing the follow-
<lb break="no"/>ing words:</p><p></p><p>“ The Sibyl’s Wreath.—In this very pretty little volume we
<lb/>have found more real fun than all the games we have yet seen.—
<lb/>It is well got up, and deserves the patronage of every family in

opinion as editorial—as our own.
</p><p>We have no such opinion. The book is contemptible
<lb/>at all points, and we should be sorry to recommend it to
<lb/>"every family in the Union.” What would “ every fami-
<lb break="no"/>ly in the Union” think of us, if, upon looking into a book
<lb/>at our recommendation, “ every family in the Union”

In valleys calm and deep,
Where pine and ever-green cedar grow
And bending willows weep.
Beautiful flowers its banks adorn,
Its waves are lily-crowned,
And harvests of the emerald com
Swell o’er the plains around.
Yet not for this, for evermore
I love its silvery tide;
My steadfast, peerless Isadore
Dwells on the river-side!
Still unto her my spirit leans,
When, by the river side,
’Mid fragrant flowers and evergreens
I walk at eventide.
Upon its grassy banks at noon,
Like one in dreams astray,
I listen to the tremulous tune
The gliding waters play.
I loiter by its waves at night,
Through shadowy vales afar,
With visions of ideal delight
Entranced as lovers are.
With tremulous stars the waters gleam,
Like old enchanted streams:—
Beneath her lattice, wreathed with vine,
They murmur whilst she dreams!

Nor the love thou hast lost,
Nor the tears that it cost,
Nor the life which has reached its December.

ODE TO THE MUSES
BY THE REV. JOHN PIERPONT.

Ye gentle muses! make me first
Of bards—like Harry Hirst !
To me the fire afford,
Of William W. Lord!
And be my songs like Coxe’s “ Saul,’’
</p><p>Filled up with most abundant fol
<lb/>-lol,
<lb/>fol</p><p>de riddle dol!
</p><p>Ye gentle muses! let my rhymes
<lb/>Ring like the clinking chimes
<lb/>Of those Campanalo-
<lb break="no"/>—gian ringers, whom you know,</p><p>Within the Tabernacle Hall,
</p><p>Present abundantly the fol
<lb/>—lol,
<lb/>fol</p><p>de riddle ded!
Ye gentle muses! if you will,
With fire my verses fill;
Permit this lamp of mine
O’er other lamps to shine;
And, if you won’t, confound ye all!
</p><p>I’ll treat you to abundant fol
<lb/>-lol,
<lb/>fol</p><p>de riddle dol!

Epigram.
From the Saxon.
Tom’s choice in fellowship and friends,
Behold his levee’s silent throngs;
Bad measures, meant for viler ends,
		Foul thoughts and meditated wrongs;		
All passions low, all base desires,			
And prejudices monster-grown,			
Crowd to the saloon of his sires,			
Yet Tom is in his house,—alone!

The Double Dream.
Our life is two-fold—Byron.
Fondly all through yesternight,
Fondly did I dream of thee,
And my soul, in deep delight,
Wandered with thine far and free:
Brightest visions round me shone;
All for which my heart had yearned,
All the dearest scenes I’d known,
’Neath the spell of sleep , returned:
Fancy too assumed the helm,
And the ship of thought drove far,
O’er the dream-sea’s mystic realm,—
Thou, the sole and guiding star!
Wilt thou hear me sing the scenes
Mirrored in that Eden sleep —
Unto thee my spirit leans,
Enchantress, for the meaning deep!

I.
First, within a brilliant hall.
’Mid the youthful, gay, and bright,
Glanced a form more fair than all,
Like a spirit on my sight!
Proudly through the circling dance,
As, between the stars, the moon,
Moved she, with a stately glance,
To the old and festive tune.
Sweet the music,—for it seemed
But her motion’s atmosphere,—
Filled with light that round her beamed,—
Captivating eye and ear.
Thoughts, like fountains years-subdued,
In my bosom poured their tide,
And, entranced like Saul, I stood,
Mute with homage at her side!

II.
</p><p>Months seemed passed,—and now a scene
<lb/>Pastoral-sweet was round me spread ;—
<lb/>On the hills, the spring-time’s green,</p><p>And the blue sky overhead!
Winding down a forest river,
In a lightly-leaning boat,—
Snowy sails in breezy quiver,
By her side I seemed to float.
Music from her voice was breathed,
Sweeter than a singing bird’s;
Smiles around her lips were wreathed,
Like the starlight of her words.
Long we sailed,—and passion’s sighs
Kneeling then, I dared to pour,—
But a storm o’erwhelmed the skies!
I was wrecked upon the shore!

III.
Fancy now more wild became!
</p><p>Far through foreign lands I roved,
<lb/>Armed,—a knight,—in lists of fame,—
<lb/>Championing my Ladye-Love.</p><p>Pomp and splendor round me shone,
Cavaliers and maidens bright,—
But above them all was one
Beautiful as morning light!—
On my shield her scroll I bore,—
Fairest Virgin op the West,—
Round my breast her scarf I wore,
And her colors in my crest.
Shouting loud defiance out,
</p><p>Sought I then the marshalled strife,—
<lb/>Proudly with the boldest fought,—
<lb/>Perilling with joy my life!</p><p>Soon a victor, from the scene
To her feet I bore the prize,—
Crowned her there as Beauty’s Queen,—
Drank my plaudits from her eyes!
IV.
But a change now strangely passed
O’er my wild and fevered dream;—
Where tall trees their shadows cast,
By a sweet, secluded stream,
We were roving;—overhead,
Smiling like an angel’s face,
Hung the moon, as if to shed
Love-light on that trysting place.
In the shadows and the hush
Of that old, moon-silvered grove,—
Prayer, and vow, and tear, and blush!—
Plighted we our troth and love!—
What beside this then occurred
Underneath that smiling sky,
Thou must ask that startled bird!—
Thou must dream as well as I!
Such my visions yesternight,—
So my spirit roved with thine,—
Drinking in a wild delight,—
Revelling ’mid scenes divine!
Strange indeed our dreams are wrought;
Fancy, Memory and Hope,
All combine to cheat the thought
With their gay Kaleidescope!
What within my dream was drawn
From the Past, thy heart can tell;
What was Fancy’s work alone,
Thou canst see and solve as well.
But our dreams are Sibyls too;—
Could we read their visits right,
We might in their lessons view
Stars to guide the Future’s night.
Then, enchantress, solve the scenes
Mirrored in my last night’s sleep!
Unto thee my spirit leans,
Belshazzar-like, for meaning deep.

Musical Department.
</p><p>First Concert of the Philharmonic Society.—The
<lb/>Overtures and Symphonies were certainly performed in a
<lb/>style worthy of the Philharmonic Society, and we tender
<lb/>our thanks to the government thereof, for thus interrupt-
<lb break="no"/>ing the musical drowsiness which prevailed ever since
<lb/>the last concert of this Society. Madame Lazarre’s play-
<lb break="no"/>ing was exquisite, though a slight nervousness could be
<lb/>perceived during the whole performance of the very diffi-
<lb break="no"/>cult composition. Mrs. Mott acquitted herself well, and
<lb/>Mr. Wollenhaupt was so scared that it would not be
<lb/>doing him justice to make any comments on his perform-
<lb break="no"/>ance.</p><p>
A full notice of Ole Bull’s Concert, on Wednesday last,
will be found in our next.

</p><p>Mr. Huber, the celebrated Violincellist, gave a Musi-
<lb break="no"/>cal Soirée on Tuesday evening last. We found a most
<lb/>brilliant array of ladies, and a most interesting party of
<lb/>gentlemen. Ms. Huber favored us with some of his
<lb/>choicest compositions ; and nothing we could say would
<lb/>be enough to express their beauty, and the artistical
<lb/>style in which they were performed. He was accompa-
<lb break="no"/>nied on the Piano, by his sister, and many a complete
<lb/>professor could yet learn of her. Mrs. Mott sang some
<lb/>very beautiful airs with her usual good grace ; and Mr.</p><p><pb n="325"/>
</p><p>White, an amateur, sang a bass-solo very respectably.—
<lb/>We feel assured that Mr. Huber’s concerts will be attended
<lb/>by the elite of New-York.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Templeton’s Concert at the Tabernacle.—Al-
<lb break="no"/>though the price of the tickets was only 50 cents, a
<lb/>most fashionable audience greeted this charming vocalist
<lb/>with their cheers, and the desire was universally expres-
<lb break="no"/>sed, that he might repeat his entertainment as soon as
<lb/>possible.</p><p></p><p>The Delcy Troupe, we believe, are not quite as suc-
<lb break="no"/>cessful as the placards in the street try to make one be-
<lb break="no"/>lieve. The performance of Lucia di Lammermoor was
<lb/>as good a specimen of musical murder as we have wit-
<lb break="no"/>nessed.</p><p></p><p>The German Opera.—Der Freischutz is to be the first
<lb/>performance, and Mr. Rapetti will lead the orchestra.—
<lb/>If properly managed, it will be a profitable enterprise.</p><p></p><p>A New system of musical notation for the Blind has
<lb/>been invented. We shall speak at length of it at some
<lb/>future opportunity.</p><p>Ole Bull has invited the pupils of the Institution for
the Blind to his last Farewell Concert.
Homans &amp; Ellis have published some of De Meyer’s
compositions.
We heard some of the best singing at Dr. Potts’ church,
on Sunday last.
</p><p>An Oratorio, composed by an American, will be
<lb/>brought out soon, in this city. We hope it will be more
<lb/>successful than the American Grand Opera.</p><p>Mrs. Mott, assisted by Mr. Kyle, intend giving a
series of Concerts at Boston.
</p><p>Ole Bull sails positively on the 1st of December, for
<lb/>Havre. We are really anxious to hear what his old ac-
<lb break="no"/>quaintances in Europe will say of his playing.</p><p></p><p>Miss Northall.—This lady gives a concert at the
<lb/>Apollo, on the fourth of December. In addition to the at-
<lb break="no"/>traction of her own voice—no small attraction by the bye
<lb/>—she has obtained the assistance of Sig. De Begnis and
<lb/>Mr. Timm.</p><p>
The Drama.

Mr. Forrest is playing occasionally in the English pro-
vinces, always to great houses, and with brilliant success.
Miss Cushman, at the latest advices, did not appear to
be employed.
</p><p>Mr. Andersoh, formerly in this country, is playing in
<lb/>London with moderate success—Mr. Macready to
<lb/>crowded audiences, and, according to report, better than
<lb/>for many years.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Murdock played at Baltimore five nights, to the
<lb/>best houses of the season. His next engagement, we un-
<lb break="no"/>derstand, is at Boston.</p><p></p><p>The Keans are playing at this latter city with fair suc-
<lb break="no"/>cess. The American public, begin, we think, to grow ‘ a
<lb/>weary of them.’</p><p>Mrs. Mowatt passed through Richmond last week, on
her way to engagements at the South.
</p><p>Some one or other in the name of the “Santee” River,
<lb/>makes himself conspicuous in a letter to the Charleston
<lb/>Courier, in sneering at dramatic and musical performers:
<lb/>compares, in a most exceptionable spirit, the Philadelphia
<lb/>audiences to bourgeois, and thinks to be an American actor
<lb/>“ is’nt much,” &amp;c. We doubt whether the able and gen-
<lb break="no"/>tlemanly conductor of that print, or any body else, egrees
<lb/>with him in that.</p><p>The Delcy engagement, at the Park Theatre, has prov-
</p><p>ed a failure. The organization of the company is ineffi-
<lb break="no"/>cient, but the best we imagine it was in the power of the
<lb/>management to command.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Hudson’s new Lectures at Boston, (Lear and Othel-
<lb break="no"/>lo,) have attracted a great deal of attention, and have been
<lb/>very successful with the audiences to which they have
<lb/>been delivered.</p><p>
Editorial Miscellany.

</p><p>The Frog-Pond seems to be dried up—and the Frogs
<lb/>are, beyond doubt, all dead—as we hear no more croaking
<lb/>from that quarter.</p><p>
</p><p>We copy the subjoined passage from “Wilmer &amp;
<lb/>Smith’s European Times.” The observations are so
<lb/>plainly just as to need not a word in the way of com-
<lb break="no"/>ment :</p><p></p><p>A Boston publication, called ‘ Littell’s Living Age,’ has found
<lb/>its way to this city, and is advertised in our newspapers, though it
<lb/>consists of nothing but pilfering from the English magazines and
<lb/>reviews. It may also be met with in one or two cabinets de lecture,
<lb/>frequented by the English and Americans. Pirated editions, or if
<lb/>you prefer the phrase, reprints, of the works of Scott, Bulwer,
<lb/>Dickens, and other eminent authors, are imported into France in
<lb/>great numbers from America, and, from the lowness of their price,
<lb/>meet with a ready sale. There are one or two English circulating
<lb/>libraries in this city entirely stocked with American reprints. The
<lb/>injury this causes to the authors and proprietors of the works is
<lb/>incalculable. At one time a brace of publishers here carried on a
<lb/>roaring trade by reprinting all the works that issued from the Eng-
<lb break="no"/>lish press, and smuggling them into England for the circulating
<lb/>libraries; one of these honest men actually became enriched from
<lb/>his wholesale piracies on Walter Scott alone.</p><p></p><p>But a law lately passed, directing the immediate destruction of
<lb/>every pirated work, has put a considerable check on their consci-
<lb break="no"/>entious trade; and it now appears that they find it more profitable
<lb/>to import from the United States than to reprint. Belgium preys
<lb/>with a voracious audacity on French literature,—not a work can
<lb/>be published here that is not brought out there, and sold all over
<lb/>the Continent infinitely cheaper than French publishers, who have
<lb/>authors to pay, can afford. The publishers of M. Thiers’ Histore
<lb/>du Consulat et de l' Empire has been cruelly victimized by those
<lb/>Belgian pirates. He has paid somewhere about ₤20,000 for the
<lb/>copyright of the work, and has sold some 30,000 copies. The Bel-
<lb break="no"/>gians have not paid one single farthing for copyright, and have
<lb/>sold 100,000 copies. It is a burning and scandalous shame to gov-
<lb break="no"/>ernments of such enlightened countries as America, England,
<lb/>France and Belgium, that a law of literary copyright is not estab-
<lb break="no"/>lished.</p><p>The Mirror says:
</p><p>Americans.—An address delivered before the Eucleian Society
<lb/>of the New-York University, June 30, 1845, by Cornelius Ma-
<lb break="no"/>thews. We published the address in the Mirror soon after its de-
<lb break="no"/>livery. We could not understand it then, and cannot now.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Mathews, we should judge, punctuates his manuscript with
<lb/>a pepper-box. We like his thoughts better than the idiosyncrasies
<lb/>of his style. He should reform it altogether.</p><p></p><p>Whatever, in the opinion of the worshippers of Bri-
<lb break="no"/>tain and everything British, may be objectionable in the
<lb/>matter of Mr. Mathews’ address, its manner, at least, is
<lb/>simple and unaffected, and we are quite at a loss to dis-
<lb break="no"/>cover anything incomprehensible in any portion of the
<lb/>essay. There is a good saying of Dr. Johnson’s, about
<lb/>the extreme unfairness of requiring an author to supply
<lb/>at once thought and brains for its comprehension.</p><p>We do not intend to claim the honor of originating
in the Journal the exquisite poem, by Halleck, now pub-
<pb n="326" break="no" />
</p><p>lished. It is not included, however, in any edition of his
<lb/>poems. Independently of the high intrinsic merit of the
<lb/>piece, there is a tale about it—a romantic tale—which
<lb/>we could unfold, if we thought proper, and which to cer-
<lb break="no"/>tain readers will give it additional interest.</p><p>
Items from foreign Sources.
</p><p>In these days of peace and political fusion, the Revolution and
<lb/>the Empire in France are, as we have seen, gradually com-
<lb break="no"/>completing their unfinished monuments. Fifty years after the first
<lb/>proposal of the project by the celebrated painter David, and its
<lb/>adoption by the Convention, the city of Lille has been celebrating
<lb/>the anniversary of the memorable siege which it sustained in 1792,
<lb/>by the inauguration of a monument, consisting of a granite column,
<lb/>surmounted by a bronze statue represnting the city of Lille. The
<lb/>spirit of the occasion, and of its proceedings, our readers know
<lb/>enough of their gallant neighbours the French to have no difficulty
<lb/>in conceiving. Thirty-nine towns and communes of the northern
<lb/>part of France were represented by deputations of their national
<lb/>guard; St. Cyr and the Polytechnic Schools sent representatives;
<lb/>and the army contributed a delegate of each rank from every regi-
<lb break="no"/>ment. An old gunner of 1792, caught amongst them in the midst
<lb/>of their excitement, had the dangerous honours of an ovation on the
<lb/>shoulders of his fellow-citizens: and Louis Phillippe, who knows
<lb/>his countrymen better than any of us, or of themselves, contrived with
<lb/>his matchless tact, to sympathise in the feeling of the hour, after a
<lb/>fashion identifying his own royal attributes with its republican
<lb/>bias. In his name, the Mayor of Lille, amid the tumultous accla-
<lb break="no"/>mations of the crowd, presented to M. Scheppers, the sole surviving
<lb/>member of the municipality of Lille, at the period of the siege,
<lb/>the “ Star of the Brave,” as the latter called it in the figurative
<lb/>mood of the occasion—“ one of the finest episodes of the day,” say
<lb/>the highly excited journals of the department.—London Athenaum.</p><p>
</p><p>It is an amusing sight, and enlivening withal, to look at the rows
<lb/>of white tents, the beautiful girls and their elegant dresses, the
<lb/>crowds of spectators, each sheltered by a bright coloured umbrella,
<lb/>and some thirty or forty ladies and gentlmen, fat and thin, tall and
<lb/>short, old and young, in the water together, dipping and spluttering,
<lb/>shouting and shrieking, as the white-crested wave rolls towards
<lb/>them—some attempting to swim, others, fearful of being caried out
<lb/>to sea, clinging to their attendants’ arms, and endeavoring to make
<lb/>their escape to terra firma. Here an old woman bearing aloft a
<lb/>little cherub, independent of any costume, to dip it a due number of
<lb/>times—there a bathing girl encouraging a stout old gentleman to
<lb/>venture into the water, after he has received the first souse on the
<lb/>head from the contents of a bason, to prevent his feeling the effect of
<lb/>the shock to his feet. Sometimes three or four young ladies will go
<lb/>in together, or a gentleman may be seen leading gallantly some fair
<lb/>one of his acquaintance: but everything is conducted with the
<lb/>strictest propriety and decorum; so that however extraordinary the
<lb/>style may appear at first to a stranger, he soon becomes accustomed
<lb/>to it.</p><p></p><p>The most amusing scenes have passed, never to recur, when the
<lb/>friars came down to bathe. Some years ago there was an enor-
<lb break="no"/>mously fat friar, who was ordered to take a certain number of baths
<lb/>at a certain hour in the morning, and it was the general amusement
<lb/>to go down and see him perform the ceremony. He had ten persons
<lb/>to attend him, six men who stood on the shore holding ropes attached
<lb/>to his waist (for he had conscious of his own floating qualities, a
<lb/>most pious horror of being washed away), and four women who
<lb/>accompanied him into the water. When they got him there with a
<lb/>proper solicitude for his health, they took good care to make him per-
<lb break="no"/>form his ablutions abundantly. While the men slackened the rope,
<lb/>they used to dip him and duck him most unmercifully, pressing his
<lb/>head down with their hands, like the merry wives of Windsor
<lb/>packing Sir John Falstaff into the clothes-basket. He dared not
<lb/>resist, for fear they should leave him to his fate, and they would not
<lb/>let him out till he had taken the prescribed number of dips—he
<lb/>spluttering, and crying, and praying and swearing all the time.
<lb/>Now and then, though seldom, the same scene is enacted with a
<lb/>stout artizan, or a country farmer.—Lusitawan Sketches.</p><p></p><p>Dr. Balfour, of Glasgow, has been appointed Professor

<lb/>Clergyman of the Episcopal Church, New York. Parts 1 &amp; 2.
<lb/>This work is beautifully printed on fine paper, embellished, and
<lb/>handsomely bound. Price 37 1/2 cents.</p><p>The following are extracts from a few of the notices it has re-
ceived from the Press:—
“ There is a natural vigor in this poem (World for Sale) which
is wrung from the life,—a wild music from the very heart strings.”
—Morning News.
</p><p>“ This is a scene (snow) that every one will recognize as life-
<lb break="no"/>like and truthful,—no artist could paint it better.”—Hud. Riv.
<lb/>Chronicle.</p><p>“We have seen many quartos, not taken either from the lowest
rank of dullness, with far less that is acceptable in them.”—Dem.
Review.
</p><p>“We commend this volume to the lover of true poetry, and can
<lb/>say, in all sincerity, if Mr. Hoyt, in his following numbers, sus-
<lb break="no"/>tains the character of this, there is no doubt of his success.”—N.
<lb/>Y. Evening Mirror.</p><p></p><p>“ It is printed in a very neat and even elegant style, worthy of
<lb/>the grace, delicacy and beauty of the poems.”—N. Y. Courier and
<lb/>Enquirer.</p><p></p><p>“ He writes with grace, taste and genius, and many of his pro-
<lb break="no"/>ductions possess merit of the highest order. Some of his best
<lb/>pieces will be incorporated in a new edition of the Poets and
<lb/>Poetry of America.”—Phil. Nat. Gazette.</p><p></p><p>“We give a stanza from the principal poem in the volume,
<lb/>commending this delicious little brochure as one of the best New
<lb/>Year’s presents that could be selected."—N. Y. Express.</p><p></p><p>" The Chaunt is one of the finest modern poems that we have
<lb/>read this many a day, and abounds in highly wrought and beautiful
<lb/>passages. The author, Rev. Ralph Hoyt, is destined to a high
<lb/>rank in the American temple of poetry, and we heartily thank
<lb/>him for providing us such a rare poetic feast as he has given us
<lb/>in this volume.”—N. Y. Rambler.</p><p></p><p>“ Full of delicate description, perfect truth and beauty of senti-
<lb break="no"/>ment; and style pure and limpid as the chrystal stream, all envel-
<lb break="no"/>oped in a charming atmosphere of grace and piety and purest im-
<lb break="no"/>agination. It is a gem and a noble offering,”— Churchman.</p><p></p><p>“Part II. contains the second canto of a very fine poem,—the
<lb/>Chaunt of Life: From the first stanza we quote three remarkably
<lb/>beautiful lines. The fourth and fifth stanzas are very noble.—
<lb/>The poem Old has so many rare and peculiar excellences, that
<lb/>we shall venture to copy it in full.”—Broadway Journal.</p><p>“ The Chaunt of Life is like the opening of some glorious ma
</p><p>jestic strain of music, through which the mournful spirit of the
<lb/>past gives tone and unutterable earnestness to the aspirations of
<lb/>the present and the hopes of the future. Such strains as those of
<lb/>our author will be heard. They sink at once into the heart and
<lb/>abide there."—Prot. Churchman.</p><p></p><p>“We have not seen a volume in a year that we have been more
<lb/>taken with than this. It is a pleasure to meet an author who can,
<lb/>like Mr. Hoyt, make his theories attractive and his method strik-
<lb break="no"/>ing without setting up for a misanthrope, or invoking the aid of
<lb/>the infernals.—Phil. Sat. Eve. Post.</p><p>

J. F. BROWNE &amp; CO.
MANUFACTURER OF THE
IMPROVED PATENT DOUBLE-ACTION HARP,
By Royal Letters Patent, London. Established 1810. (Many years with Erard.
J. F. BROWNE respectfully informs his Friends and the Musical World, that he has established himself for the manufacture
and importation of these very beautiful instruments, at
281 BROADWAY, and 73 1-2 CHAMBERS STREET.
His arrangements are such as to enable him to transact business at European prices, thereby saving purchasers the high duties
mposed by Tariff on these Instruments.
</p><p>J. F. Browne would observe, these Harps are constructed on the most approved principles, with all the modern improvements of
<lb/>London and Paris, are unequalled in brilliancy of tone, fineness of touch, and perfectness of mechanism. Particular care is taken
<lb/>to fit them for the extremes of climate in this country, in which respect they will be found far superior to any of European manufac-
<lb break="no"/>ture, imported in the usual way.</p><p>These Harps are patronized by the elite of musical taste and professional talent in Europe; among the latter, he would mention
N. C. Boscha, who invariably selects from this establishment.
J. F. Browne begs to offer the opinions of some of the first professional talent in this country.
</p><p>Mr. J. F. Browne, Sir Having had for several years past, the opportunity of making a professional use of your Harps, and of
<lb/>testing their qualities, it affords me pleasure to certify, that in point of tone, workmanship, and above all, a solidity that stands proof
<lb/>against the inconstancy of our trying climate, they have in all cases given me the most entire satisfaction.</p><p>January, 1845.	I am yours, CHARLES THIBAULT, No. 40 Beach St., N. Y.
</p><p>Dear Sir:—I write to express the delight I experienced in performing on one of your Harps at Sig. Casella’s Concert in this city.—
<lb/>The mechanism is perfect, and the quality of Tone certainly superior to any harp I have heard for many years. I remember my old
<lb/>Master, Boscha, always gave the preference to your Harps, indeed he himself used no other. Yours, most truly, H. G. TRUST!
<lb/>Philadelphia, March 4th, 1844.</p><p></p><p>Mr. J. F. Browne, Sir :—I have much pleasure in saying, that the Harp of your make I performed on at the St. George’s Society
<lb/>Concert, is, in brilliancy of tone, touch, and elegance of workmanship, the finest I ever played on. This will apply to all your Harps
<lb/>The grand six and a half Gothic Double action, is a most splendid instrument. Yours, with respect, ELIZABETH SLOMAN.
<lb/>New York, January 16th, 1845.	A pupil of N. C. Boscha.</p><p></p><p>Mr. J. F. Browne, Sir:--Having at your request closely scrutinized your double-action Harps, I find they possess the best quali-
<lb break="no"/>ties of the first makers in Europe combined. That in the ease of touch, by which the most brilliant tone is obtained, in perfection and
<lb/>ease of modulation, they are superior to any I have used; their elegance of exterior must gratify the most refined taste. Your new
<lb/>Grand Gothic six and a half octave, is the most splendid effort of art yet produced in the musical world ; it will give me great pleasure
<lb/>in recommending your Harps at every opportunity.	Yours Truly, HENRY HORN.</p><p>January 12th, 1845.	An eminent professor, and Member of the Royal Academy.
</p><p>These are but a very small part of the testimonials received, but will suffice to show the estimate of persons every way capable of
<lb/>making a correct decision. J. F. Browne has also received the Franklin Medal of the Society of Arts, Philadelphia, for his splendid
<lb/>improvements in this delightful Instrument.</p><p>Harps from 300 to 1000 dollars. Harps repaired, strings, &amp;c.

By the Rev. Joseph Wolff. LL.D.
</p><p>“This work has created a prodigious excitement throughout
<lb/>England: it is unique in its character, as a literary production. It
<lb/>seems to partake of the features of an autobiography; the narrative
<lb/>being full of personal detail, description of the perilous adventure
<lb/>and imminent hazard of the author, in his expedition through the
<lb/>East. No man living, perhaps, has travelled so extensively as this
<lb/>celebrated individual, and few could have contributed a more in-
<lb break="no"/>tensely interesting narrative of his experience.</p><p></p><p>“It will thus be seen that this extraordinary and eccentric man
<lb/>is admirably qualified to present a transcript of Asiatic Character-
<lb break="no"/>istics,—supplying much that is novel and exceedingly curious
<lb/>about tribes and nations of which we know so little. To say that
<lb/>the work is an acceptable addition to the library of travel, is affirm-
<lb break="no"/>ing far too little of so striking a production : it is a book that ought
<lb/>to be read and deliberately enjoyed by every intelligent person, for
<lb/>its quaintness, freshness, and superabounding interest. The work

<lb/>Dentist in this city. Dr. S.’s manner of inserting artificial teeth
<lb/>varies in many essential points from the usual mode ; and his suc-
<lb break="no"/>cess in pleasing all, he is happy to say, has brought him many
<lb/>difficult cases, which had been unsuccessfully treated by Dentists
<lb/>of established professional reputation, and whose prices for the
<lb/>same operation were double his own. The object in inserting
<lb/>artificial teeth is to supply the deficiency occasioned by the loss of
<lb/>natural teeth, both in regard to utility, comfort in wearing, and
<lb/>natural appearance. In all these points, Doct S.’s manner is pre-
<lb break="no"/>eminent. His mechanical tact and ingenuity have enabled him to I
<lb/>surmount many obstacles, which have long, with the profession
<lb/>generally, impeded the path to success in every operation. He
<lb/>makes use of the best materials in all his operations—and in cases
<lb/>where the gum has fallen away by absorption, (which is always
<lb/>the case, more or less, when teeth have been extracted,) which
<lb/>causes a contraction of the lips and checks, the disfigurement of
<lb/>which cannot be fully obviated without adopting the artificial gums,
<lb/>which will supply the deficiency, and give to the mouth its usual
<lb/>redundancy—besides, their beauty and natural appearance, ren-
<lb break="no"/>der detection impossible.</p><p>Dr. S. would be happy to refer those who require it, to many of

<lb/>as small a quantity of each kind as they like and have them packed
<lb/>in one chest. These Teas also come in five pound Chinese pack-

<lb/>It is of the first pickings, and ex

</p><p>*Caution. —Large quantities of Hyson Skin are retailed in
<lb/>this market as being a Hyson Tea. It is well worth while to com-
<lb break="no"/>pare the Hyson tea usually sold at 75 cents with the genuine arti-
<lb break="no"/>cle that the Company offer at the same price. The difference is so
<lb/>perceptible on trial as to render any further comment unnecessary.</p><p></p><p>Monstrous Fraud.—Gunpowder and Imperial Teas cannot be
<lb/>retailed by small dealers, in this country, at 75 cents per pound,
<lb/>because they frequently cost that money in China, and no Importer
<lb/>in this city can sell good Gunpowder or Imperial Tea at a less
<lb/>price than 75 cents per pound by the hundred packages. T. F.
<lb/>Davies, Esq., in his interesting work on China, details the manner
<lb/>in which he saw the lowest grades of Black Teas manufactured
<lb/>and colored with Prussian Blue, so as to closely imitate Gunpow-
<lb break="no"/>der and Imperial Teas, and adds, the Prussian Blue being a com-
<lb break="no"/>bination of Prussic Acid with Iron, is of course a dangerous poi-
<lb break="no"/>son. Let purchasers therefore beware of adulterated leas, and
<lb/>deal with those venders whose characters and resources raise them
<lb/>above suspicion. Beware of the Gunpowder and Imperial Teas
<lb/>retailed at 75 cents per pound, and compare them with the genuine
<lb/>article sold by the Pekin Tea Company No one, it is presumed,
<lb/>wishes to drink poison. The Company have published a book,
<lb/>giving full details on this subject, which may be had at their
<lb/>Warehouse, 75 Fulton street, free of charge.</p><p>RECOMMENDATIONS.
</p><p>We drink Green Tea, and for many years have been paying one dollar per
<lb/>pound for it. But thanks to the Pekin Tea Company, we now get a better tea
<lb/>from them at 75 cents per pound. We drink one pound per week, by which
<lb/>we are now saving thirteen dollars per year, and enjoying better tea in the
<lb/>bargain. Commend us to the Pekin Tea Company, say we.—Mirror.</p><p></p><p>The Pekin Tea Company, 75 Fulton street, are performing a great and good
<lb/>work, and will, in a few years, beyond all doubt, drive all the poor teas which
<lb/>have deluged this country, and defrauded consumers of the article, out of the
<lb/>market. They import none but pure and fragrant teas, and retail them by the
<lb/>single pound at wholesale prices. Families are always sure of obtaining good
<lb/>teas at this great tea warehouse, in quantities to suit their convenience, and at
<lb/>the same price that the merchant pays who buys to sell again.—Daily True
<lb/>Sun.</p><p></p><p>You may be sure of obtaining at all times, pure and highly flavored teas, by
<lb/>the single pound, at wholesale prices, of ihe Pekin Tea Company, 75 Fulton
<lb/>street.—They have probably the largest stock, and greatest variety of fine
<lb/>green and black teas, of any one establishment in the United States. They
<lb/>are doing a large business, and a great benefit to consumers of tea.—Atlas.</p><p></p><p>Heretofore it has been very difficult, indeed impossible, to always obtain
<lb/>good green and black teas. But now you have only to visit the ware rooms of
<lb/>the Pekin Tea Company, 75 Fulton street, to obtain as delicious and fragrant
<lb/>teas as you could wish for.—Daily Sun.</p><p>If any of our readers desire to have good tea, they can obtain it of the Pekin
Tea Company, 75 Fulton street.—Mercury.
A Word to Tea Drinkers.—The Pekin Tea Company, 75 Fulton street,
</p><p>have imported into this market some five hundred thousand dollars worth of
<lb/>the finest grades of Green and Black Teas grown in the Celestial Empire, done
<lb/>up in all the various fancy packages that Chinese ingenuity can invent. It is
<lb/>a privilege to buy teas at this great establishment, and a luxury and comfort
<lb/>to drink them They sell good teas only, and retail them at wholesale prices.
<lb/>Country merchants who wish to always sell good teas can always obtain them
<lb/>at this place, on reasonable terms.—Emporium.</p><p></p><p>The Pekin Tea Company—We very cheerfully call the attention of all
<lb/>lovers of pure and fragrant Teas, both in town and country, to the great Tea
<lb/>warehouse of this Company. Our long acquaintance with the proprietors en-
<lb break="no"/>ables us to bespeak for them the entire confidence of the public. We know
<lb/>that their Teas, both in quality and price, are all that is stated of them. Many
<lb/>a lover of the fragrant herb has been compelled to eschew the drinking of Tea
<lb/>in consequence of its injurious effects, until at length he has become hopeless
<lb/>of finding, among any of the imported varieties of Tea in our market a kind
<lb/>which had not such an effect. In this, however, such persons will be agree-
<lb break="no"/>ably disappointed. The Pekin Tea Company have commenced the importation
<lb/>of choice varieties of Garden Teas, of most delicious flavor-cultivated and
<lb/>picked with great care, which have heretofore never been introduced into this
<lb/>country, except as presents to importers. Among these they have, an Oolong,
<lb/>mild as zephyr, and fragrant as a rose, which we especially recommend to all
<lb/>nervous persons, Its effect upon many of those who have tried it, has been
<lb/>to make them confirmed tea drinkers. Ladies who have used it, say they
<lb/>never before drank such tea. But all tastes can here he suited, with the great
<lb/>advantage over other stores of getting a pure article at wholesale price, how-
<lb break="no"/>ever small the quantity. The Company’s Warehouse is at 75 Fulton street.—
<lb/>New World.</p><p></p><p>Tea.—The Pekin Tea Company, No 75 Fulton street, unquestionably sell
<lb/>the best teas imported into this market. That they sell them cheaper than any
<lb/>other establishment, is a fact proven in a thousand instances since they have
<lb/>opened their store.</p><p></p><p>We would advise our friends to call at this place, and if they don’t wish to
<lb/>buy, at least to obtain a little pamphlet, kept on their counter, entitled "Hints
<lb/>to Tea Drinkers,” and therefrom learn a little useful information on the subject.</p><p>The pamphlet is given gratis.—Anglo American.
</p><p>The finest specimens of green and black teas ever sold in this country, are
<lb/>imported by the Pekin Tea Company, 75 Fulton street. Those who want good
<lb/>teas at reasonable prices, can always get them there.—Tribune.</p><p></p><p>We have tried the teas imported by the Pekin Tea Company, 75 Fulton street,
<lb/>and if we live will try them often. They are selling the most delicious teas
<lb/>we ever drank, and retail them at wholesale prices.—Evening Post. oct8</p><p>PIANO FORTES.
