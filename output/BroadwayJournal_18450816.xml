<lb/>without violating the rules of courtesy in stopping to gaze at
<lb/>him. As he approached, he occasionally turned towards the
<lb/>boys with an angry glance, but without saying anything, and
<lb/>then hurried on as if to outstrip them, but it would not do.
<lb/>They followed close behind the orator, each one observing
<lb/>him so intently that he said nothing to his companions.</p><p>Just before I met him, he stopped a Mr. C---------, a cashier of
</p><p>one of the banks, said to be as odd a fish as John himself. I
<lb/>loitered into a store close by—and really he was the strang-
<lb break="no"/>est looking being I ever beheld.</p><p></p><p>His long, thin legs, about as thick as a stout walking-
<lb break="no"/>cane, and of much such a shape, were encased in a pair of
<lb/>tight small clothes, so tight that they seemed part and par-
<lb break="no"/>cel of the wearer. Handsome white stockings were fasten-
<lb break="no"/>ed with great tidiness at the knees by a small gold buckle,
<lb/>and over them, coming about half way up the calf, were a
<lb/>pair of what, I believe, are called hose, coarse and country
<lb/>knit. He wore shoes. They were old-fashioned, and fasten-
<lb break="no"/>ed also with buckles—huge ones. He trod like an Indian,
<lb/>without turning his toes out, but planking them down straight
<lb/>ahead. It was the fashion in those days to wear a fan-tailed
<lb/>coat, with a small collar, and buttons far apart behind, and
<lb/>few on the breast. Mr. Randolph’s was the reverse of all
<lb/>this. Instead of its being fan-tailed, it was what, I believe,
<lb/>the knights of the needle call swallow-tailed: the collar was
<lb/>immensely large, the buttons behind were in kissing prox-
<lb break="no"/>imity, and they sat together as close on the breast of the gar-
<lb break="no"/>ment as the feasters at a crowded public festival. His waist
<lb/>was remarkably slender; so slender that, as he stood with
<lb/>his arms akimbo, he could easily, as I thought, with his long
<lb/>bony fingers, have spanned it. Around him his coat, which
<lb/>was very tight, was held together by one button and, in con-</p><p></p><p>sequence, an inch or more of tape, to which the buttons was
<lb/>attached, was perceptible where it was pulled through the
<lb/>cloth. About his neck he wore a large white cravat, in
<lb/>which his chin was occasionally buried as he moved his
<lb/>head in conversation; no shirt collar was perceptible: every
<lb/>other person seemed to pride himself upon the size of his,
<lb/>as they were then worn large. Mr. Randolph’s complexion
<lb/>was precisely that of a mummy—withered, saffron, dry, and
<lb/>bloodless; you could not have placed a pin's point on his face
<lb/>where you would not have touched a wrinkle. His lips were
<lb/>thin, compressed, and colorless; the chin, beardless as a
<lb/>boy’s, was broad for the size of his face, which was small;
<lb/>his nose was straight, with nothing remarkable in it, except
<lb/>perhaps it was too short. He wore a fur cap, which he took
<lb/>off, standing a few moments uncovered.</p><p></p><p>I observed that his head was quite small, a characteristic
<lb/>which is said to have marked many men of talent: Byron,
<lb/>Walter Scott, and Chief Justice Marshall, for instance. Judge
<lb/>Burnet of Cincinnati, who has been alike distinguished at
<lb/>the bar, on the bench, and in the United States Senate, has
<lb/>also a very small head.</p><p>THE BROADWAY JOURNAL.

Lenore.
Ah, broken is the golden bowl! the spirit flown forever!
Let the bell toll!—a saintly soul floats on the Stygian river,
And, Guy De Vere, hast thou no tear ?—weep now or never more!
See! on yon drear and rigid bier low lies thy love, Lenore!
Come! let the burial rite be read—the funeral song be sung !—
An anthem for the queenliest dead that ever died so young—
dirge for her the doubly dead in that she died so young.
“Wretches! ye loved her for her wealth and hated her for her
pride,
“And when she fell in feeble health, ye blessed her—that she
died!
“How shall the ritual, then, be read?—the requiem how be
sung
“By you — by yours, the evil eye, — by yours, the slanderous
tongue
“That did to death the innocence that died, and died so young?”
Peccavimus; but rave not thus! and let a Sabbath song
Go up to God so solemnly the dead may feel no wrong!
The sweet Lenore hath “gone before,” with Hope, that flew be-
side,
Leaving thee wild for the dear child that should have been thy
bride—
For her, the fair and debonair, that now so lowly lies,
The life upon her yellow hair but not within her eyes—
The life still there, upon her hair—the death upon her eyes.
“Avaunt! to-night my heart is light. No dirge will I upraise,
*But waft the angel on her flight with a Poean of old days!
“Let no bell toll! — lest her sweet soul, amid its hallowed
mirth,
“Should catch the note, as it doth float—up from the damned
Earth.
“To friends above, from fiends below, the indignant ghost is
riven—
“From Hell unto a high estate far up within the Heaven—
“From moan and groan, to a golden throne, beside the King of
Heaven.
EDGAR A. POE.
John Randolph, of Roanoke.
Great wits to madness nearly are allied.
</p><p>I REMEMBER some years since to have seen John Randolph
<lb/>in Baltimore. I had frequently read and heard descriptions
<lb/>of him, and one day, as I was standing in Market, now Bal-</p><p></p><p>timore-street, I remarked a tall, thin, unique-looking being
<lb/>hurrying towards me with a quick impatient step, evidently
<lb/>much annoyed by a crowd of boys who were following close
<lb/>at his heels, not in the obstreperous mirth with which they
<lb/>would have followed a crazy or a drunken man, or an organ
<lb/>grinder and his monkey, but in the silent, curious wonder,
<lb/>with which they would have haunted a Chinese bedecked in
<lb/>full costume. I instantly knew the individual to be Ran-
<lb break="no"/>dolph from the descriptions. I therefore advanced towards</p><p><pb n="82"/>
</p><p>Mr. Randolph’s hair was remarkably fine—fine as an in-
<lb break="no"/>fant’s, and thin. It was very long, and was parted with great
<lb/>care on the top of his head, and was tied with a bit of black
<lb/>ribbon about three inches from his neck ; the whole of it
<lb/>formed a queue not thicker than the little finger of a delicate
<lb/>girl. His forehead was low, with no bumpology about it;
<lb/>but his eye, though sunken, was most brilliant and startling
<lb/>in its glance. It was not an eye of profound, but of passion-
<lb break="no"/>ate thought, with an expression at times such as physicians
<lb/>asscribe to that of insanity, but an insanity which seemed to
<lb/>quicken, not destroy, intellectual acuteness. I never beheld
<lb/>an eye that struck me more. It possessed a species of fasci-
<lb break="no"/>nation, such as would make you wonder over the character
<lb/>of its possessor, without finding any clew in your wonder-
<lb break="no"/>ment to discover it, except that he was passionate, wayward,
<lb/>and fearless. He lilted his long bony finger impressively as
<lb/>he conversed, and gesticulated with it in a peculiar manner.
<lb/>His whole appearance struck me, and I could easily imagine
<lb/>how, with his great command of language, so appropriate
<lb/>and full, so brilliant and classical, joined to the vast informa-
<lb break="no"/>tion that his discursive oratory enabled him to exhibit in its
<lb/>fullest extent, from the storehouse of which, the vividness of
<lb/>his imagination was always pointing out a happy analogy or
<lb/>bitter sarcasm, that startled the more from the fact, that his
<lb/>hearers did not perceive it until the look, tone, and finger
<lb/>brought it down with the suddenness of lightning—and with
<lb/>its effects, upon the head of his adversary; taking all this into
<lb/>consideration, I could easily imagine, how when almost a boy,
<lb/>he won so much fame, and preserved it so long, and with so
<lb/>vast an influence, notwithstanding the eccentricity and incon-
<lb break="no"/>sistency of his life, public and private.</p><p></p><p>By-the-bye, the sudden, unexpected, and aphoristical way
<lb/>in which Randolph often expressed his sentiments, had much
<lb/>to do with his oratorical success. He would, like Dean
<lb/>Swift, make a remark, seemingly a compliment, and explain
<lb/>it into a sarcasm, or he would utter an apparent sarcasm, and
<lb/>turn it into a compliment. Many speakers, when they have
<lb/>said a thing, hurry on to a full explanation, fearful that the
<lb/>hearer may not understand them; but when Randolph ex-
<lb break="no"/>pressed one of these startling thoughts, he left the hearer
<lb/>for some time puzzling in doubt as to what he meant, and,
<lb/>when it pleased him, in the coolest manner in the world he
<lb/>explained his meaning, not a little delighted if he discovered
<lb/>that his audience were wondering the while upon whom the
<lb/>blow would descend, or what principle the remark would be
<lb/>brought to illustrate. A little anecdote, which I heard a
<lb/>Member of Congress from Kentucky tell of him, shows this
<lb/>characteristic. The Congressman, on his first visit to Wash-
<lb break="no"/>ington, (he had just been elected,) was of course desirous of
<lb/>seeing the lions. Randolph, though not a member of either
<lb/>house, was there, and had himself daily borne into the Se-
<lb break="no"/>nate or House, by his faithful Juba, to listen to the debates.
<lb/>Every body, noted or unnoted, were calling on the eccentric
<lb/>orator, and the Member from Kentucky determined to do like-
<lb break="no"/>wise, and gratify his curiosity. A friend, General---, pro-
<lb break="no"/>mised to present him, saying though: “You must be prepar-
<lb break="no"/>ed for an odd reception, for if Randolph is in a bad humor,
<lb/>he will do and say any thing; if he is in a good humor, you
<lb/>will see a most finished gentleman ” They called. Mr.
<lb/>Randolph was stretched out on a sofa. “He seemed,” said
<lb/>the member, “a skeleton endowed with those flashing eyes
<lb/>which ghost stories give to the reanimated body when sent
<lb/>upon some earthly mission.”</p><p></p><p>The Congressman was presented by his friend, the Gene-
<lb break="no"/>ral, as a Member of Congress from Kentucky. “Ah! from
<lb/>Kentucky, sir!” exclaimed Randolph, in his shrill voice, as</p><p></p><p>he rose to receive him; “from Kenlucky, sir ; well, sir, I
<lb/>consider your State the Botany Bay of Virginia!” The Ken-
<lb break="no"/>tuckian thought that the next remark would be a quotation
<lb/>from Barrington’s Botany Bay Epilogue, applied by Randolph
<lb/>to the Virginia settlers of Kentucky:</p><p>True patriots we, for be it understood,
We left our country for our country’s good.
</p><p>but Randolph, after a pause, continued : “I do not make this
<lb/>remark, sir, in application to the morals or the mode of set-
<lb break="no"/>tlement in Kentucky. No, sir, I mean to say that it is my
<lb/>opinion, sir, that the time approaches when Botany Bay will,
<lb/>in all respects surpass England, and I fear it will soon be so
<lb/>with your State and mine.”</p><p></p><p>I cite this little anecdote, not from any peculiar pith that
<lb/>it possesses, but in illustration of his character, and in proof
<lb/>of the remark above made.</p><p></p><p>If Mr. Randolph had lived in ancient times, Plutarch, with
<lb/>all his powers in tracing the analogies of character, would
<lb/>have looked in vain for his parallel. And a modern biogra-
<lb break="no"/>pher, with all ancient and modern times before him, will find
<lb/>the effort fruitless that seeks his fellow. At first, the reader
<lb/>might think of Diogenes as furnishing some resemblance to
<lb/>him, and that all that Randolph wanted was a tub; but not so.
<lb/>If another Alexander had asked him what he would have that
<lb/>imperial power could bestow—the answer never would have
<lb/>been to request to stand out of his sunlight. No: Randolph,
<lb/>if he could not have got any higher emolument and honor,
<lb/>would immediately have requested to be sent upon a foreign
<lb/>mission ; that over, if Alexander had nothing more to give,
<lb/>and was so situated as not to be feared, who does not believe
<lb/>that the ex-minister would turn tail on him ?</p><p></p><p>The fact is, that Randolph was excessively ambitious, a
<lb/>cormorant alike for praise and plunder; and though his pa-
<lb break="no"/>triotism could point out the disinterested course to others, his
<lb/>love of money would not let him keep the track himself
<lb/>—at least in his latter years, when Mammon, the old man’s
<lb/>God, beset him, and he turned an idolator to that for which
<lb/>he had so often expressed his detestation that his country-
<lb break="no"/>men believed him. His mission to Russia broke the charm,
<lb/>that the prevailing opinion of his disinterestedness cast about
<lb/>him; and his influence in his native State was falling fast
<lb/>beneath the appointment and outfit and salary that had
<lb/>disenchanted it, when he died; and now old Virginia will
<lb/>forget and forgive the inconsistencies of one of her greatest
<lb/>sons to do reverence to his memory.</p><p></p><p>Randolph’s republicanism was never heartfelt: he was at
<lb/>heart an aristocrat. He should have been born in England, a
<lb/>noble—there he would stubbornly have resisted the encroach-
<lb break="no"/>ments of all below him upon his own prerogatives, station>
<lb/>dignity, and quality, of all above him a little below his level,
<lb/>or at least upon an equality with his. Randolph would have
<lb/>lifted Wilkes up to be a thorn in the side of a king whom he
<lb/>disliked, and to overthrow his minister; had he been himself
<lb/>a minister, his loyalty would then have pronounced Wilkes
<lb/>an unprincipled demagogue. Wilkes, we know, when he
<lb/>got in office, said he could prove to his majesty that he him-
<lb break="no"/>self had not been a Wilkite.</p><p></p><p>Randolph was intensely selfish, and his early success as a
<lb/>politician and orator impressed him with an exaggerated opi-
<lb break="no"/>nion of his own importance at an early age, when such opi-
<lb break="no"/>nions are easily made and not easily eradicated. In the case
<lb/>of Randolph, this overweaning self-estimation grew mon-
<lb break="no"/>strous. “Big man me, John,” and the bigness or littleness
<lb/>of others’ services were valued and proclaimed, just as they
<lb/>elevated or depressed the interests and personal dignity of
<lb/>(he orator of Roanoke. And often, when his interest had</p><p><pb n="83"/>
</p><p>nothing to do with the question presented to him, his caprice
<lb/>would sway his judgment—for his personal resentments led
<lb/>him far away from every consideration, save that of how he
<lb/>could best wound his adversary.</p><p></p><p>His blow wanted neither vigor nor venom; his weapons
<lb/>were poisoned with such consummate skill, and he so well
<lb/>knew the vulnerable point of every character, that often
<lb/>when the wound by an observer who knew nothing of his op-
<lb break="no"/>ponent seemed slight, it was rankling in the heart. Randolph ;
<lb/>was well acquainted with the private history of the eminent
<lb/>men of his time, the peccadilloes, frailties, indiscretions,
<lb/>weaknesses, vanities, and vices of them all. He used his
<lb/>tongue as a jockey would his whip ; hit the sore place till
<lb/>the blood came, and there was no crack, or flourish, or noise,
<lb/>in doing it. It was done with a celerity and dexterity which
<lb/>showed the practised hand, and its unexpectedness as well
<lb/>as its severity, often dumb-founded the victim so completely,
<lb/>that he had not one word to say, but withdrew in silence.</p><p></p><p>I remember hearing two anecdotes of Randolph, which
<lb/>strikingly type his character. One exhibits his cynical rude-
<lb break="no"/>ness and disregard for the feelings of others—in fact, a wish
<lb/>to wound their feelings—and the other his wit. I do not
<lb/>vouch for their accuracy, but I give them as I have frequent-
<lb break="no"/>ly heard them, as perhaps has the reader.</p><p>Once, when Randolph was in the city of B----, he was in
</p><p>the daily habit of frequenting the bookstore of one of the larg-
<lb break="no"/>est booksellers in the place. He had made some purchases
<lb/>from him, and was very curious in looking over his books, &amp;c.
<lb/>In the course of Randolph’s visits he became very familiar</p><p>with Mr.------, the bookseller, and they held long chats to-
gether; the orator of Roanoke showing off with great cour-
tesy. Mr.-----, was quite a pompous man, rather vain of
</p><p>his acquaintance with the lions who used to stop in his shop.
<lb/>Subsequently, being in Washington with a friend, he espied
<lb/>Randolph advancing towards him, and told his friend that
<lb/>he would introduce him to the great man. His friend,
<lb/>however, knowing the waywardness of Randolph, declined.</p><p>“ Well,” said -Mr.----, “ I’m sorry you will not be in-
</p><p>troduced. I’ll go up and give him a shake of the hand at
<lb/>any rate.” Up he walked, with outstretched hand to salute
<lb/>the cynic. The aristocratic republican (by the bye, how of-
<lb break="no"/>ten your thoroughgoing republican is a full blooded aristo-
<lb break="no"/>crat in his private relations) immediately threw his hands
<lb/>behind him, as if he could not dull his palm in that way,
<lb/>and gazed searchingly into the face of the astonished book-
<lb break="no"/>seller. “ Oh, oh !” said he, as if recollecting himself, “ You</p><p>arc Mr. B-----from Baltimore ?" “ Yes sir,” was the reply.
“ A bookseller ?” “ Yes sir,” again. “ Ah ! I bought books
from you ?”	“ Yes, sir, you did." “ Did I forget to pay you
</p><p>for them “ No, sir, you did not.” “ Good morning, sir!”
<lb/>said the orator, lifting his cap with offended dignity, and
<lb/>passing on. This anecdote does not show either Randolph’s
<lb/>goodness of head or heart, but it shows his character.</p><p>The other anecdote is as follows: The Honorable Peter
----, who was a watch-maker, and who represented B--------
</p><p>County for many years in Congress, once made a motion to
<lb/>amend a resolution ottered by Randolph, on the subject of
<lb/>military claims. Mr. Randolph rose up after the amendment
<lb/>had been offered, and drawing out his watch from his fob,
<lb/>asked the Honorable Peter what o'clock it was. He told him.
<lb/>"Sir," replied the orator, “you can mend my watch, but
<lb/>not my motions. You understand tictics, sir, but not tac-
<lb break="no"/>tics."</p><p></p><p>That too, was a fine retort, when, after he had been
<lb/>speaking, several members rose in succession and attacked
<lb/>him. “Sir," said he to the Speaker, “ I’m in the condition</p><p>of old Lear—
The little dogs and all,
Tray, Blanch, and Sweetheart,
See—they bark at me.
</p><p>“ Mr. Randolph,” exclaimed an acquaintance to him,
<lb/>hurrying to his side in the street, “ I have tried my hardest
<lb/>to overtake you.” “ You will have to try harder than your
<lb/>hardest to keep up with me—sir, to keep up with me !” ex-
<lb break="no"/>claimed the orator, running off at the top of his speed.</p><p></p><p>He said of a person who refused to accept his challenge
<lb/>upon the ground of religious scruples against duelling, that
<lb/>“ he had sculked behind the communion table.” He called
<lb/>the Greeks, “ Christless Christians.” Of the new Constitu-
<lb break="no"/>tion of Virginia, he said; “ It was brought into life with the
<lb/>Sardonic grin of death upon its countenance.”</p><p></p><p>A political opponent boasted on the stump, that if his mind
<lb/>was not naturally as strong as the Orator’s of Roanoke, he
<lb/>had done his best by an arduous collegiate course to improve
<lb/>it, &amp;c."</p><p></p><p>“ Not the first weak soil, gentlemen,” exclaimed Randolph
<lb/>interrupting him, “ that excessive cultivation has reduced to
<lb/>barrenness; — let him stay at home—let him lie fallow-
<lb break="no"/>fallow.”</p><p>A volume of such pithy sayings of his might easily be col-
lected.
</p><p>All accounts agree in praising the oratorical powers of
<lb/>Randolph. His manner was generally slow and impressive;
<lb/>his voice squeaking, but clear and distinct, and as far as it
<lb/>could be heard, what he said was clearly understood. His
<lb/>gesture was chiefly with his long and skeleton like finger.
<lb/>The impressiveness with which he used it has been remark-
<lb break="no"/>ed by all who have heard him. When he was sarcastic,
<lb/>amidst a thousand it would say, stronger than any language,
<lb/>to the individual whom he meant, “thou art the man.” In
<lb/>his choice of language he was very fastidious, making some-
<lb break="no"/>times a considerable pause to select a word. His reading was
<lb/>extensive, and in every department of knowledge—romances,
<lb/>tales, poems, plays, voyages, travels, history, biography,
<lb/>philosophy—all arrested his attention, and each had detained
<lb/>him long enough to render him familiar with the best works
<lb/>of the kind. Mis mind was naturally erratic, and his desul-
<lb break="no"/>tory reading, as he never devoted himself to a profession,
<lb/>and dipped a little into all, increased his natural and mental
<lb/>waywardness. He seldom reasoned, and when he did, it
<lb/>was with an effort that was painful, and which cost him more
<lb/>trouble than it was worth. He said himself in one of his
<lb/>speeches in the Senate of the United States, that “ he had
<lb/>a defect, whether of education or nature was immaterial, per-
<lb break="no"/>haps proceeding from both—a defect which had disabled him,
<lb/>from his first entrance into public life to the present hour,
<lb/>from making a regular speech." The defect was, doubtless,
<lb/>both from education and nature; education might have, in
<lb/>some measure, corrected the tendencies of his nature, but
<lb/>there was, perhaps, an indiosyncrasy in the constitution of
<lb/>the man, which compelled him to be erratic in mind as well
<lb/>as in temper.</p><p></p><p>He said that “ ridicule was the keenest weapon in the
<lb/>whole parliamentary army,” and he learned all the tricks of
<lb/>fence with it, and never played with foils. He seemed to
<lb/>have had more admiration for the oratory of Chatham than
<lb/>that of any other individual—if we may judge from the man-
<lb break="no"/>ner in which that great man is mentioned in his speeches.
<lb/>They were certainly unlike in character, — very unlike.
<lb/>Chatham having had bad health, and it being well known
<lb/>that he went to Parliament and made his best efforts when
<lb/>almost sinking from sickness Randolph might have felt
<lb/>that, as he had done the same thing, their characters were</p><p></p><p>when he rose to reply to Henry, and so strong was Henry’s
<lb/>conviction of his powers, that he spoke of them in the high-
<lb break="no"/>est terras, and prophesied his future eminence. Randolph
<lb/>gloriously said of Henry that, “ he was Shakspeare and
<lb/>Garrick combined.”</p><p></p><p>Randolph’s character and conduct forcibly impress upon us
<lb/>the power of eloquence in a Republic. How many twists,
<lb/>and tergiversations, and obliquities were there in his course;
<lb/>yet how much influence he possessed, particularly in Virgi-
<lb break="no"/>nia! How much he was feared, courted, admired, shunned,
<lb/>hated, and all because he wielded the weapon that “ rules
<lb/>the fierce democracy!” How many men, far his superiors in
<lb/>practical usefulness, lived unhonored and without influence,
<lb/>and died unsung, because they had not eloquence. Eloquence
<lb/>is superior to all other gifts, even to the dazzling fascinations
<lb/>of the warrior; for it rules alike in war and peace, and it
<lb/>wins all by its spell. Randolph was the very personification
<lb/>of inconsistency. Behold him talking of the splendid misery </p><p>of “ office-holders;” what did he want with office ; a cup of
 cold water was better in his condition ; the sword of Damo-
cles was suspended over him by a single hair, &amp;c., &amp;c.;—
 when lo ! he goes to the frigid north—for what ? For health ?
No, for an outfit and salary! and dies childless, worth, it is 
said, nearly a million !
</p><p>Randolph’s oratory reminds us forcibly of Don Juan; and
<lb/>if Byron had written nothing but Don Juan, Randolph might
<lb/>have been called the Byron of orators. He had all the wit,
<lb/>eccentricity, malice, and flightiness of that work—its touches
<lb/>that strike the heart, and sarcasms that scorn, the next mo-
<lb break="no"/>ment, the tear that has started.</p><p></p><p>In a dying state, Randolph went to Washington during
<lb/>the last Session of Congress, and although not a member, he
<lb/>had himself borne daily to the hall of legislation to witness
<lb/>the debate. He returned home to his constituents, and was </p><p></p><p>elected to Congress, and started on a tour to Europe, if pos-
<lb break="no"/>sible to regain his health ; he said it was “ the last throw of
<lb/>the die.”</p><p></p><p>He expired in Philadelphia, where he had first appeared
<lb/>in the councils of the nation, in the sixty-first year of his age,
<lb/>leaving a reputation behind him for classic wit and splendid
<lb/>eloquence which few of his contemporaries may hope to
<lb/>equal; and a character which his biographer may deem him-
<lb break="no"/>self fortunate if he can explain to have been compatible
<lb/>with either the duties of social life, the sacredness of friend-
<lb break="no"/>ship, or the requirements of patriotism, unless he offer as an
<lb/>apology, partial derangement. In the letter in which the
<lb/>deceased acknowledged that he had made a misstatement
<lb/>with regard to the character of Mr. Lowndes, on the tariff,
<lb/>he assigned, as a reason for the error, the disordered state of
<lb/>his mind, arising from the exciting medicine which he was
<lb/>compelled to take to maintain life.</p><p></p><p>“Remorse,remorse, remorse!” Shortly before he died, he
<lb/>repeated the word three times, and requested the doctor to
<lb/>write it upon the back of one of his (Randolph’s) cards, and
<lb/>to underscore the word, so as to make it emphatic. (Re-
<lb break="no"/>morse !) “ Put it in your pocket, doctor, and recur to it when
<lb/>I an gone—Remorse, remorse, remorse!”</p><p></p><p>Yet was the ruling passion strong in death. The doctor
<lb/>was reading the bible to him and mispronounced the word
<lb/>“ omnipotent,” accenting it as though it were not a compound
<lb/>word—omni-potent. “Nipotent—nipotent,sir!” he exclaim-
<lb break="no"/>ed with oratorical energy.</p><p></p><p>I have, perhaps, expressed myself harshly—inconsistently
<lb/>with that charitable feeling which all should possess, who
<lb/>are “ treading upon ashes under which the fire is not yet ex-
<lb break="no"/>tinguished.” If so, to express our conscientious opinions is</p><p><pb n="84"/>
</p><p>assimilated. Chatham was seized with a fainting fit when
<lb/>making his last speech, and died a short time afterwards.
<lb/>And probably it is not idle speculation to say that Randolph,
<lb/>with a morbid, or perhaps insane admiration of his character
<lb/>—wished to sink as Chatham did, in the legislative hall, and
<lb/>be borne thence to die.</p><p></p><p>However, there was enough in the character of Chatham
<lb/>to win the admiration of any one who loved eloquence, with-
<lb break="no"/>out seeking in adventitious circumstances a motive for his ad-
<lb break="no"/>miration ; and Randolph appreciated such talents as his too
<lb/>highly not to have admitted them under all circumstances,
<lb/>but his reverence was doubtless increased, from the resem-
<lb break="no"/>blance which he saw in their bodily conditions, and which he
<lb/>was very willing to believe extended to their minds. Chat-
<lb break="no"/>ham was bold, vehement, resistless—not often witty, but
<lb/>eminently successful when he attempted it; invective was
<lb/>his forte. In some of these points, Randolph resembled him ;
<lb/>but then Chatham’s eloquence was but a means to gain his
<lb/>ends; his judgment was intuitive, his sagacity unrivalled;
<lb/>he bore down all opposition by his fearless energies, and he
<lb/>compelled his enemies to admit that he was a public bene-
<lb break="no"/>factor in the very breath in which they expressed their perso-
<lb break="no"/>nal dislike. Chatham kept his ends steadily in view, and
<lb/>never wavered in his efforts to gain them. Not so Randolph.
<lb/>He reminds us of the urchin in the “Lay of the last Min-
<lb break="no"/>strel,” who always used the fairy gifts with a spirit of devil-
<lb break="no"/>try, to provoke, to annoy, and to injure, no matter whom he
<lb/>wounded, or when, or where. Randolph did not want per-
<lb break="no"/>sonal dignity, but he wanted the dignity which arises from
<lb/>consistent conduct, a want which no brilliancy of talent can
<lb/>supply. On the contrary, the splendor of high talents but
<lb/>serves to make such inconsistency the more apparent. He
<lb/>was an intellectual meteor, whose course no one could pre-
<lb break="no"/>dict ; but, be it where it might, all were certain that it would
<lb/>blaze, and wither, and destroy. As a statesman, it is be-
<lb break="no"/>lieved that he never originated a single measure, though his
<lb/>influence often destroyed the measures of others. Some one
<lb/>observes, “that the hand which is not able to build a hovel
<lb/>may destroy a palace,” and he seemed to have had a good
<lb/>deal of the ambition of him who fired the Ephesian dome. As
<lb/>a scholar, he left nothing behind him, though his wit was va-
<lb break="no"/>rious, and his acquirements profound. He seems not to have
<lb/>written a common communication for a newspaper, without
<lb/>great labor and fastidious correction. I have been informed
<lb/>by a compositor who set a part of his speech on “ Retrench-
<lb break="no"/>ment," which he dedicated to his constituents, that emendations
<lb/>were endless. I have a part of the MS. of this speech before
<lb/>me; it is written with a trembling hand, but with great at-
<lb break="no"/>tention to punctuation, and with a delicate stroke of the pen.
<lb/>It was as an orator he shone ; and as an orator his power of
<lb/>chaining the audience has been perhaps never surpassed. In
<lb/>an assembly where Demosthenes, Cicero, Chatham, Mira-
<lb break="no"/>beau, or Henry spoke, Randolph’s eloquence would have
<lb/>been listened to with profound interest, and his opposition
<lb/>would have been feared. As an orator, he felt his power—
<lb/>he knew that in eloquence he yielded a magic wand, and he
<lb/>was not only fearless of opposition, but he courted it; for who
<lb/>of his contemporaries has equalled him in the power of carry-
<lb break="no"/>ing on successfully the partisan warfare of desultory debate—
<lb/>the cut and thrust—the steady aim? who could wield like him
<lb/>the tomahawk, and who of them possessed his dexterity in
<lb/>scalping afoe? His trophies are numberless, and he wore them
<lb/>with the pride of his progenitors, for there was truly a good
<lb/>deal of Indian blood in his veins. It is said that Randolph first
<lb/>signalized himself by making a stump speech in Virginia in
<lb/>opposition to Patrick Henry ; scarcely any one knew him |</p><p>THE BROADWAY JOURNAL.
</p><p>modern Scholiasts are equally acute. These fellows demon-
<lb break="no"/>strate a hidden meaning in “ The Antediluvians, ”a parable in
<lb/>“ Powhatan,” new views in “ Cock Robin,” and transcenden-
<lb break="no"/>talism in “ Hop 0’ My Thumb.” In short, it has been
<lb/>shown that no man can sit down to write without a very
<lb/>profound design. Thus to authors in general much trouble
<lb/>is spared. A novelist, for example, need have no care of his
<lb/>moral. It is there—that is to say it is somewhere—and the
<lb/>moral and the critics can take care of themselves. When
<lb/>the proper time arrives, all that the gentleman intended, and
<lb/>all that he did not intend, will be brought to light, in the
<lb/>“ Dial,” or the “ Down-Easter,” together with all that he
<lb/>ought to have intended, and the rest that he clearly meant
<lb/>to intend :—so that it will all come very straight in the end.</p><p></p><p>There is no just ground, therefore, for the charge brought
<lb/>against me by certain ignoramuses—that I have never writ-
<lb break="no"/>ten a moral tale, or, in more precise words, a tale with a
<lb/>moral. They are not the critics predestined to bring me out,
<lb/>and develop my morals:—that is the secret. By and by the
<lb/>“ North American Quarterly Humdrum” will make them
<lb/>ashamed of their stupidity. In the meantime, by way of
<lb/>staying execution—by way of mitigating the accusations
<lb/>against me—I offer the sad history appended;—a history
<lb/>about whose obvious moral there can be no question what-
<lb break="no"/>ever, since he who runs may read it in the large capitals which
<lb/>form the title of the tale. I should have credit for this ar-
<lb break="no"/>rangement—a far wiser one than that of La Fontaine and
<lb/>others, who reserve the impression to be conveyed until the
<lb/>last moment, and thus sneak it in at the fag end of their
<lb/>fables.</p><p></p><p>Defuncti injuria ne afficiantur was a law of the twelve
<lb/>tables, and De mortuis nil nisi bonum is an excellent injunc-
<lb break="no"/>tion—even if the dead in question be nothing but dead small
<lb/>beer. It is not my design, therefore, to vituperate my de-
<lb break="no"/>ceased friend, Toby Dammit. He was a sad dog, it is true,
<lb/>and a dog's death it was that he died ; but he himself was
<lb/>not to blame for his vices. They grew out of a personal de-
<lb break="no"/>fect in his mother. She did her best in the way of flogging
<lb/>him while an infant—for duties to her well-regulated mind
<lb/>were always pleasures, and babies, like tough steaks, or the
<lb/>modem Greek olive trees, are invariably the better for beat-
<lb break="no"/>ing—but, poor woman ! she had the misfortune to be left-
<lb break="no"/>handed, and a child flogged left-handedly had better be left
<lb/>unflogged. The world revolves from right to left. It will
<lb/>not do to whip a baby from left to right. If each blow in
<lb/>the proper direction drives an evil propensity out, it follows
<lb/>that every thump in an opposite one knocks its quota of wick-
<lb break="no"/>edness in. I was often present at Toby’s chastisements, and,
<lb/>even by the way in which he kicked, I could perceive that he
<lb/>was getting worse and worse every day. At last I saw,
<lb/>through the tears in my eyes, that there was no hope of the
<lb/>villain at all, and one day when he had been cuffed until
<lb/>he grew so black in the face that one might have mistaken
<lb/>him for a little African, and no effect had been produced be-
<lb break="no"/>yond that of making him wriggle himself into a fit, I could
<lb/>stand it no longer, but went down upon my knees forthwith,
<lb/>and, uplifting my voice, made prophecy of his ruin.</p><p></p><p>The fact is that his precocity in vice was awful. At five
<lb/>months of age he used to get into such passions that he was
<lb/>unable to articulate. At six months, I caught him gnawing
<lb/>a pack of cards. At seven months he was in the constant
<lb/>habit of catching and kissing the female babies. At eight
<lb/>months he peremptorily refused to put his signature to the
<lb/>Temperance pledge. Thus he went on increasing in iniqui-
<lb break="no"/>ty, month after month, until, at the close of the first year, he
<lb/>not only insisted upon wearing moustaches, but had con-</p><p>85
sometimes to do wrong.
Why draw his frailties from their dread abode ?
</p><p>For who can tell, in the close alliance between reason and
<lb/>madness which were so strongly mixed up in his character,
<lb/>how much his actions and words partook of the one or the
<lb/>other? Where they alternated, or where one predominated,
<lb/>or where they mingled their influence, not in the embrace of
<lb/>love, but in the strife for mastery, oh ! how much he may
<lb/>have struggled with his mental aberrations and felt that they
<lb/>were errors, and yet struggled in vain! His spirit, like
<lb/>the great eye of the universe, may have known that clouds
<lb/>and storms beset it, and have felt that it was contending
<lb/>with disease and coming death, yet hoped at last to beam
<lb/>forth in its brightness.</p><p>The day draws on, though storms keep out the sun,
And thus the heart will break, and brokenly live on.
And so it is with the mind, and Randolph’s “brokenly liv-
ed on,” until the raven shadows of the night of death gather- 
ed over him, and gave him to the dark beyond.

A Dream.
In visions of the dark night
I have dreamed of joy departed—
But a waking dream of life and light
Hath left me broken-hearted.
</p><p>Ah ! what is not a dream by day
<lb/>To him whose eyes are cast
<lb/>On things around him with a ray
<lb/>Turned back upon the past ?</p><p>That holy dream—that holy dream,
While all the world were chiding,
Hath cheered me as a lovely beam
A lonely spirit guiding.
What though that light, thro' storm and night,
So trembled from afar—
What could there bo more purely bright
In Truth’s day-star ?	P.

A TALE WITH A MORAL.
</p><p>“ Con tal que las costumbres de un autor," says Don Thom-
<lb break="no"/>as De Las Torres, in the preface to his “ Amatory Poems”
<lb/>“ sean puras y castas, importo muy poco que no sean igual-
<lb break="no"/>mente severas sus obras"—meaning, in plain English, that,
<lb/>provided the morals of an author are pure, personally, it sig-
<lb break="no"/>nifies nothing what are the morals of his books. We pre-
<lb break="no"/>sume that Don Thomas is now in Purgatory for the assertion.
<lb/>It would be a clever thing, too, in the way of poetical jus-
<lb break="no"/>tice, to keep him there until his “ Amatory Poems” get out
<lb/>of print, or are laid definitely upon the shelf through lack of
<lb/>readers. Every fiction should have a moral; and, what is
<lb/>more to the purpose, the critics have discovered that every
<lb/>fiction has. Philip Melancthon, some lime ago, wrote a
<lb/>commentary upon the “ Batrachomyomachia” and proved
<lb/>that the poet’s object was to excite a distaste for sedition.
<lb/>Pierre La Seine, going a step farther, shows that the inten-
<lb break="no"/>tion was to recommend to young men temperance in eating
<lb/>and drinking. Just so, too, Jacobus Hugo has satisfied him-
<lb break="no"/>self that, by Euenis, Homer meant to insinuate John Calvin ; </p><p>by Antinous, Martin Luther; by the Lotophagi, Protestants
in general; and, by the Harpies, the Dutch. Our more
took myself to remonstrance. Again I collected my energies
for a final attempt at expostulation.
</p><p>When I had made an end of my lecture, Mr. Dammit in-
<lb break="no"/>dulged himself in some very equivocal behaviour. For some
<lb/>moments he remained silent, merely looking me inquisitively
<lb/>in the face. But presently he threw his head to one side,
<lb/>and elevated his eyebrows to great extent. Then he spread
<lb/>out the palms of his hands and shrugged up his shoulders.
<lb/>Then he winked with the right eye. Then he repeated
<lb/>the operation with the left. Then he shut them both up
<lb/>very tight. Then he opened them both so very wide that I
<lb/>became seriously alarmed for the consequences. Then, ap-
<lb break="no"/>plying his thumb to his nose, he thought proper to make an
<lb/>indescribable movement with the rest of his fingers. Final-
<lb break="no"/>ly, setting his arms a-kimbo, he condescended to reply.</p><p></p><p>I can call to mind only the heads of his discourse. He
<lb/>would be obliged to me if I would hold my tongue. He wish-
<lb break="no"/>ed none of my advice. He despised all my insinuations. He
<lb/>was old enough to take care of himself. Did I still think him
<lb/>baby Dammit? Did I mean to say anything against his
<lb/>character? Did I intend to insult him? Was I a fool?
<lb/>Was my maternal parent aware, in a word, of my absence
<lb/>from the domiciliary residence ? He would put this latter
<lb/>question to me as to a man of veracity, and he would bind
<lb/>himself to abide by my reply. Once more he would demand
<lb/>explicitly if my mother knew that I was out. My confusion,
<lb/>he said, betrayed me, and he would be willing to bet the Dev-
<lb break="no"/>il his head that she did not.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Dammit did not pause for my rejoinder. Turning upon
<lb/>his heel, he left my presence with undignified precipitation.
<lb/>It was well for him that he did so. My feelings had been
<lb/>wounded. Even my anger had been aroused. For once I
<lb/>would have taken him up upon his insulting wager. I would
<lb/>have won for the Arch-Enemy Mr. Dammit’s little head—
<lb/>for the fact is, my mamma was very well aware of my
<lb/>merely temporary absence from home.</p><p></p><p>But Khoda shefa midehed—Heaven gives relief—as the
<lb/>Musselmen say when you tread upon their toes. It was in
<lb/>pursuance of my duty that I had been insulted, and I bore
<lb/>the insult like a man. It now seemed to me, however, that
<lb/>I had done all that could be required of me, in the case of
<lb/>this miserable individual, and I resolved to trouble him
<lb/>no longer with my counsel, but to leave him to his conscience
<lb/>and himself. But although I forebore to intrude with my
<lb/>advice, I could not bring myself to give up his society alto-
<lb break="no"/>gether. I even went so far as to humor some of his less rep-
<lb break="no"/>rehensible propensities; and there were times when I found
<lb/>myself lauding his wicked jokes, as epicures do mustard,
<lb/>with tears in my eyes:—so profoundly did it grieve me to
<lb/>hear his evil talk.</p><p></p><p>One fine day, having strolled out together arm in arm, our
<lb/>route led us in the direction of a river. There was a bridge,
<lb/>and we resolved to cross it. It was roofed over, by way of
<lb/>protection from the weather, and the arch-way, having but
<lb/>few windows, was thus very uncomfortably dark. As we
<lb/>entered the passage, the contrast between the external glare,
<lb/>and the interior gloom, struck heavily upon my spirits. Not
<lb/>so upon those of the unhappy Dammit, who offered to bet the
<lb/>Devil his head that I was hipped. He seemed to be in an
<lb/>unusual good humor. He was excessively lively—so much
<lb/>so that I entertained I know not what of uneasy suspicion.
<lb/>It is not impossible that he was affected with the transcen-
<lb break="no"/>dentals. I am not well enough versed, however, in the diagno-</p><p>sis of this disease to speak with decision upon the point; and
unhappily there were none of my friends of the “ Dial” pres
<pb n="86"/>
traded a propensity for cursing and swearing, and for back-
ing his assertions by bets.
</p><p>Through this latter most ungentlemanly practice, the ruin
<lb/>which I had predicted to Toby Dammit overtook him at
<lb/>last. The fashion had “ grown with his growth and strength-
<lb break="no"/>ened with his strength,” so that, when he came to be a man,
<lb/>he could scarcely utter a sentence without interlarding it
<lb/>with a proposition to gamble. Not that he actually laid wa-
<lb break="no"/>gers—no. I will do my friend the justice to say that he
<lb/>would as soon have laid eggs. With him the thing was a
<lb/>mere formula—nothing more. His expressions on this head
<lb/>had no meaning attached to them whatever. They were
<lb/>simple if not altogether innocent expletives—imaginative
<lb/>phrases wherewith to round off a sentence. When he said
<lb/>“ I’ll bet you so and so,” nobody ever thought of taking him
<lb/>up; but still I could not help thinking it my duty to put him
<lb/>down. The habit was an immoral one, and so I told him.
<lb/>It was a vulgar one—this I begged him to believe. It was
<lb/>discountenanced by society—here I said nothing but the
<lb/>truth. It was forbidden by act of Congress—here I had not
<lb/>the slightest intention of telling a lie. I remonstrated—but
<lb/>to no purpose. I demonstrated—in vain. I entreated—he
<lb/>smiled. I implored—he laughed. I preached—he sneered.
<lb/>I threatened—he swore.	I kicked him—he called for the</p><p></p><p>police. I pulled his nose—he blew it, and offered to bet the
<lb/>Devil his head that I would not venture to try that experi-
<lb break="no"/>ment again.</p><p></p><p>Poverty was another vice which the peculiar physical de-
<lb break="no"/>ficiency of Dammit’s mother had entailed upon her son. He
<lb/>was detestably poor; and this was the reason, no doubt,
<lb/>that his expletive expressions about betting, seldom took a
<lb/>pecuniary turn. I will not be bound to say that I ever heard
<lb/>him make use of such a figure of speech as “I'll bet you a
<lb/>dollar.” It was usually “ I’ll bet you what you please,” or</p><p>"I’ll bet you what you dare,” or “ I’ll bet you a trifle,” or
else, more significantly still, “ I'll bet the Devil my head."
</p><p>This latter form seemed to please him best:—perhaps be-
<lb break="no"/>cause it involved theleast risk; for Dammit had become exces-
<lb break="no"/>sively parsimonious. Had any one taken him up, his head
<lb/>was small, and thus his loss would have been small too.
<lb/>But these are my own reflections, and I am by no means sure
<lb/>that I am right in attributing them to him. At all events the
<lb/>phrase in question grew daily in favor, notwithstanding the
<lb/>gross impropriety of a man’s betting his brains like bank-
<lb break="no"/>notes :—but this was a point which my friend’s perversity
<lb/>of disposition would not permit him to comprehend. In the
<lb/>end, he abandoned all other forms of wager, and gave him-
<lb break="no"/>self up to “ I'll bet the Devil my head," with a pertinacity
<lb/>and exclusiveness of devotion that displeased not less than
<lb/>it surprised me. I am always displeased by circumstances
<lb/>for which I cannot account. Mysteries force a man to thinkt
<lb/>and so injure his health. The truth is, there was something
<lb/>in the air with which Mr. Dammit was wont to give utter-
<lb break="no"/>ance to his offensive expression—something in his manner of
<lb/>enunciation—which at first interested, and afterwards made
<lb/>me very uneasy—something which, for want of a more defi-
<lb break="no"/>nite term at present, I must be permitted to call queer ; but
<lb/>which Mr. Coleridge would have called mystical, Mr. Kant
<lb/>pantheistical, Mr. Carlyle twistical, and Mr. Emerson hyper-
<lb break="no"/>quizzitistical. I began not to like it at all. Mr. Dammit’s
<lb/>soul was in a perilous state. I resolved to bring all my elo-
<lb break="no"/>quence into play to save it. I vowed to serve him as St.
<lb/>Patrick, in the Irish chronicle, is said to have served the
<lb/>toad, that is to say, “awaken him to a sense of his situation."
<lb/>I addressed myself to the task forthwith. Once more I be-</p><p><pb n="87" break="no" />
</p><p>ent. I suggest the idea, nevertheless, because of a certain
<lb/>species of austere Merry-Andrewism which seemed to beset
<lb/>my poor friend, and caused him to make quite a Tom-Fool
<lb/>of himself. Nothing would serve him but wriggling and
<lb/>skipping about under and over everything that came in his
<lb/>way ; now shouting out, and now lisping out, all manner of
<lb/>odd little and big words, yet preserving the gravest face in
<lb/>the world all the time. I really could not make up my mind
<lb/>whether to kick or to pity him. At length, having passed
<lb/>nearly across the bridge, we approached the termination of
<lb/>the foot-way, when our progress was impeded by a turnstile
<lb/>of some height. Through this I made my way quietly,
<lb/>pushing it around as usual. But this turn would not serve
<lb/>the turn of Mr. Dammit. He insisted upon leaping the stile,
<lb/>and said he could cut a pigeon-wing over it in the air. Now
<lb/>this, conscientiously speaking, I did not think he could do.
<lb/>The best pigeon-winger over all kinds of style, was my
<lb/>friend Mr. Carlyle, and as I knew he could not do it, I would
<lb/>not believe it could be done by Toby Dammit. I therefore
<lb/>told him, in so many words, that he was a braggadocio, and
<lb/>could not do what he said. For this, I had reason to be
<lb/>sorry afterwards ;-for he straightway offered to bet the Devil
<lb/>his head that he could.</p><p></p><p>I was about to reply, notwithstanding my previous resolu-
<lb break="no"/>tions, with some remonstrance against his impiety, when I
<lb/>heard, close at my elbow, a slight cough, which sounded
<lb/>very much like the ejaculation "ahem!" I started, and
<lb/>looked about me in surprise. My glance at length fell into
<lb/>a nook of the frame-work of the bridge, and upon the figure
<lb/>of a little lame old gentleman of venerable aspect. Nothing
<lb/>could be more reverend than his whole appearance; for, he
<lb/>not only had on a lull suit of black, but his shirt was perfect-</p><p></p><p>ly clean and the collar turned very neatly down over a white
<lb/>cravat, while his hair was parted in front like a girl’s. His
<lb/>hands were clasped pensively together over his stomach, and
<lb/>his two eyes were carefully rolled up into the top of his
<lb/>head.</p><p></p><p>Upon observing him more closely, I perceived that he
<lb/>wore a black silk apron over his small-clothes; and this was
<lb/>a thing which I thought very odd. Before I had time to
<lb/>make any remark, however, upon so singular a circumstance,
<lb/>he interrupted me with a second “ ahem!"</p><p></p><p>To this observation I was not immediately prepared to
<lb/>reply. The fact is, remarks of this laconic nature are nearly
<lb/>unanswerable. I have known a Quarterly Review non-plus-
<lb break="no"/>ed by the word “ Fudge !" I am not ashamed to say, there-
<lb break="no"/>fore, that I turned to Mr. Dammit for assistance.</p><p></p><p>“ Dammit,” said I, “ what are you about ? don’t you hear ?
<lb/>—the gentleman says ‘ ahem !' ” I looked sternly at my
<lb/>friend while I thus addressed him ; for to say the truth, I
<lb/>felt particularly puzzled, and when a man is particularly
<lb/>puzzled he must knit his brows and look savage, or else he is pretty sure to look like a fool.</p><p></p><p>“ Dammit,” observed I—although this sounded very much
<lb/>like an oath, than which nothing was farther from my
<lb/>thoughts—“ Dammit,” I suggested—“ the gentleman says
<lb/>‘ ahem!' ”</p><p></p><p>I do not attempt to defend my remark on the score of pro-
<lb break="no"/>fundity ; I did not think it profound myself; but I have no-
<lb break="no"/>ticed that the effect of our speeches is not always proportion-
<lb break="no"/>ate with their importance in our own eyes ; and if I had shot
<lb/>Mr. D. through and through with a Paixhan bomb, or knock-
<lb break="no"/>ed him in the head with the “Poets and Poetry of America,”
<lb/>he could hardly have been more discomfited than when I ad-
<lb break="no"/>dressed him with those simple wyds—“ Dammit, what are</p><p>you about?—don’t you hear?—the gentleman says ‘ahem’."’
</p><p>“ You don’t say so?” gasped he at length, after turning
<lb/>more colors than a pirate runs up, one after the other, when
<lb/>| chased by a man-of-war. “ Are you quite sure he said that ?
<lb/>Well, at all events I am in for it now, and may as well put
<lb/>a bold face upon the matter. Here goes, then—ahem!"</p><p>At this the little old gentleman seemed pleased—God on-
ly knows why. He left his station at the nook of the bridge,
</p><p> limped forward with a gracious air, took Dammit by the
<lb/>hand and shook it cordially, looking all the while straight up
<lb/>in his face with an air of the most unadulterated be-
<lb break="no"/>nignity which it is possible for the mind of man to imagine.</p><p></p><p>“ I am quite sure you will win it, Dammit,” said he with
<lb/>the frankest of all smiles, “ but we are obliged to have a trial
<lb/>you know, for the sake of mere form.”</p><p></p><p>“Ahem!” replied my friend, taking off his coat with a
<lb/>deep sigh, tying a pocket-hankerchief around his waist, and
<lb/>producing an unaccountable alteration in his countenance by
<lb/>twisting up his eyes, and bringing down the corners of his
<lb/>mouth—“ahem!” And “ahem,” said he again, after a
<lb/>pause ; and not another word more than “ ahem !” did I ev-
<lb break="no"/>er know him to say after that. “Aha!” thought I, without
<lb/>expressing myself aloud—“this is quite a remarkable silence
<lb/>on the part of Toby Dammit, and is no doubt a consequence
<lb/>of his verbosity upon a previous occasion. One extreme in-
<lb break="no"/>duces another. I wonder if he has forgotten the many un-
<lb break="no"/>answerable questions which he propounded to me so fluently
<lb/>on the day when I gave him my last lecture ? At all
<lb/>events, he is cured of the transcendentals.</p><p></p><p>“ Ahem !” here replied Toby, just as if he had been read-
<lb break="no"/>ing my thoughts, and looking like a very old sheep in a re-
<lb break="no"/>verie.</p><p>The old gentleman now took him by the arm, and led him
more into the shade of the bridge—a few paces back from 
the turnstile. “ My good fellow,” said he, “ I make it a 
point of conscience to allow you this much run. Wait here,
 till I take my place by the stile, so that I may see whether 
</p><p>you go over it handsomely, and transcendentally, and don’t
<lb/>omit any flourishes of the pigeon-wing. A mere form, you
<lb/>know. I will say ‘ one, two, three, and away.’ Mind you
<lb/>I start at the word ‘ away.’ ” Here he took his position by the
<lb/>stile, paused a moment as if in profound reflection, then look-
<lb break="no"/>ed up and, I thought, smiled- very slightly, then tightened
<lb/>the strings of his apron, then took a long look at Dammit,
<lb/>and finally gave the word as agreed upon—</p><p>One—two—three.—and away!
</p><p>Punctually, at the word “ away,” my poor friend set off in
<lb/>a strong gallop. The stile was not very high, like Mr. Lord’s
<lb/>—nor yet very low, like that of Mr. Lord’s reviewers, but up-
<lb break="no"/>on the whole I made sure that he would clear it. And then
<lb/>what if he did not?—ah, that was the question—what if
<lb/>he did not ? “ What right,” said I, “ had the old gentleman
<lb/>to make any other gentleman jump ? The little old dot-and-
<lb break="no"/>carry-one! who is he ? If he asks me to jump, I won’t do it,
<lb/>that’s flat, and I don’t care who the devil he is."  The bridge,</p><p></p><p>as I say, was arched and covered in, in a very ridiculous
<lb/>manner, and there was a most uncomfortable echo about it
<lb/>at all times—an echo which I never before so particularly
<lb/>j observed as when I uttered the four last words of my re-
<lb break="no"/>mark.</p><p></p><p>But what I said, or what I thought, or what I heard, oc-
<lb break="no"/>cupied only an instant. In less than five seconds from his
<lb/>starting, my poor Toby had taken the leap. I saw him run
<lb/>nimbly, and spring grandly from the floor of the bridge, cut-
<lb break="no"/>ting the most awful flourishes with his legs as he went up.</p><p><pb n="88"/>
</p><p>I saw him high in the air, pigeon-winging it to admiration
<lb/>just over the top of the stile; and of course I thought it an
<lb/>unusually singular thing that he did not continue to go over.
<lb/>But the whole leap was the affair of a moment, and, before
<lb/>I had a chance to make any profound reflections, down came
<lb/>Mr. Dammit on the flat of his back, on the same side of the
<lb/>stile from which he had started. In the same instant I saw
<lb/>the old gentleman limping off at the top of his speed, having
<lb/>caught and wrapped up in his apron something that fell
<lb/>heavily into it from the darkness of the arch just over
<lb/>the turnstile. At all this I was much astonished; but I had
<lb/>no leisure to think, for Mr. Dammit lay particularly still, and
<lb/>I concluded that his feelings had been hurt, and that he stood
<lb/>in need of my assistance. I hurried up to him and found
<lb/>that he had received what might be termed a serious injury.
<lb/>The truth is, he had been deprived of his head, which after
<lb/>a close search I could not find anywhere ;—so I determined
<lb/>to take him home, and send for the homoeopathists. In the
<lb/>mean time a thought struck me, and I threw open an adja-
<lb break="no"/>cent window of the bridge; when the sad truth flashed upon
<lb/>me at once. About five feet just above the lop of the turn-
<lb break="no"/>stile, and crossing the arch of the foot-path so as to constitute
<lb/>a brace, there extended a flat iron bar, lying with its breadth
<lb/>horizontally, and forming one of a series that served to
<lb/>strengthen the structure throughout its extent. With the
<lb/>edge of this brace it appeared evident that the neck of my un-
<lb break="no"/>fortunate friend had come precisely in contact.</p><p>He did not long survive his terrible loss. The homoeopa-
</p><p>thists did not give him little enough physic, and what little
<lb/>they did give him he hesitated to take. So in the end he
<lb/>grew worse, and at length died, a lesson to all riotous livers.
<lb/>I bedewed his grave with my tears, worked a bar sinister
<lb/>on his family escutcheon, and, for the general expenses of
<lb/>his funeral, sent in my very moderate bill to the transcenden-
<lb break="no"/>dalists. The scoundrels refused to pay it, so I had Mr.
<lb/>Dammit dug up at once, and sold him for dog’s meat.</p><p>EDGAR A. POE.

Critical Notices,
</p><p>Graham's Magazine, for August, comes to us with a por-
<lb break="no"/>trait and biography of J. K. Mitchell, the author of “ Fly to
<lb/>the Prairie,” &amp;c. We think the likeness by no means a good
<lb/>one. Very certainly it does not flatter Dr. Mitchell. Fol-
<lb break="no"/>lowing this, we have a very fine line engraving of “ The
<lb/>Tower-Rock on the Mississippi,” and another (quite as good)
<lb/>of “Rock Mountain” from the north.</p><p></p><p>In prose, there is an interesting paper called “ The Jug-
<lb break="no"/>glers,” by a New Contributor, and “ Ida Grey” a tale of pas-
<lb break="no"/>sion, exceedingly well written, by Mrs. Osgood. In poetry,
<lb/>we notice contributions from Longfellow, Lowell, and Mrs.</p><p></p><p>Nichols. That of Mr. Longfellow is constrained and petty
<lb/>in its versification, and throughout is obviously a suggestion
<lb/>from “The Evening Wind” of Bryant, to which we refer our
<lb/>readers—especially for the passage about the sick man look-
<lb break="no"/>ing from his chamber. Nevertheless, the poem is worthy
<lb/>the genius of the author. We quote, from the conclusion
<lb/>two magnificent passages :</p><p>He (the poet) can behold
Things manifold
That have not yet been wholly told—
Have not been wholly sung nor said:
For his thought, which never stops,
Follows the water-drops
Down to the graves of the dead—
</p><p>Down through chasms and gulfs profound
<lb/>To the dreary fountain-head
<lb/>Of lakes and rivers underground,</p><p></p><p>And sees them when the rain is done
<lb/>On the bridge of colours seven
<lb/>Climbing up once more to Heaven,</p><p>Opposite the setting sun.
Tkus the seer
With vision clear
Sees forms appear and dissappear,'
In the perpetual round of strange
Mysterious change
From birth to death, from Death to birth—
From earth to heaven, from heaven to earth—
Till glimpses more sublime
Of things unseen before
Unto his wondering eyes reveal
The universe as an immeasurable wheel
Turning forever more
In the rapid and rushing river of Time.
</p><p>Mr. Lowell’s poem, “ To the Future,” has a noble com-
<lb break="no"/>mencement, and is altogether a noble composition—although
<lb/>in the last stanza is a palpable plagiarism—e. g.</p><p></p><p>As life’s alarums nearer roll
<lb/>The ancestral buckler calls
<lb/>Self clanging from the walls
<lb/>In the high temple of the soul.</p><p>This is Mr. L.’s—but Wordsworth has either the follow-
ing lines, or something resembling them—for we quote alto-
gether from memory.
Armor rustling on the walls
On the blood of Clifford calls,
And to clash again in the field
Is the wild longing of the shield.
</p><p>Except in its versification Mr. Lowell has by no means im-
<lb break="no"/>proved the idea of Wordsworth—although “self-clanging”
<lb/>has great force.</p><p></p><p>The American Review for August, is an unusually fine
<lb/>number, and contains, among other excellent papers, a valu-

<lb break="no"/>view is eminently successful.</p><p></p><p>The Democratic Review is just issued in duplicate—the

</p><p>The Characters of Shakspeare. By William Hazlitt.
<lb/>This is one of the most interesting numbers of “ The Libra-
<lb break="no"/>ry” yet issued. If anything could induce us to read anything
<lb/>more in the way of commentary on Shakspeare, it would be
<lb/>the name of Hazlitt prefixed. With his hackneyed theme
<lb/>he has done wonders, and those wonders well. He is em-
<lb break="no"/>phatically a critic a brilliant, epigrammatic, startling, para-
<lb break="no"/>doxical, and suggestive, rather than accurate, luminous, or
<lb/>profound. For purposes of mere amusement, he is the best
<lb/>commentator who ever wrote in English. At all points, ex-
<lb break="no"/>cept perhaps in fancy, he is superior to Leigh Hunt, whom
<lb/>nevertheless he remarkably resembles. It is folly to compare
<lb/>him with Macaulay, for there is scarcely a single point of
<lb/>approximation, and Macaulay is by much the greater man.
<lb/>The author of “ The Lays of Ancient Rome” has an intellect
<lb/>so well balanced and so thoroughly proportioned, as to ap-
<lb break="no"/>pear, in the eyes of the multitude, much smaller than it
<lb/>really is. He needs a few foibles to purchase him eclat.
<lb/>Now, take away the innumerable foibles of Hunt and Haz-
<lb break="no"/>litt, and we should have the anomaly of finding them more
<lb/>diminutive than we fancy them while the foibles remain.
<lb/>Nevertheless, they are men of genius still,</p><p></p><p>In all commentating upon Shakspeare, there has been
<lb/>a radical error, never yet mentioned. It is the error of at-
<lb break="no"/>tempting to expound his characters—to account for their ac-
<lb break="no"/>tions—to reconcile his inconsistencies—not as if they were
<lb/>the coinage of a human brain, but as if they had been actual
<lb/>existences upon earth. We talk of Hamlet the man, instead
<lb/>of Hamlet the dramatis persona—of Hamlet that God, in
<lb/>place of Hamlet that Shakspeare created. If Hamlet had real-
<lb break="no"/>ly lived, and if the tragedy were an accurate record of his
<lb/>deeds, from this record (with some trouble) we might, it is
<lb/>true, reconcile his inconsistences and settle to our satisfaction
<lb/>his true character. But the task becomes the purest absur-</p><p></p><p>dity when we deal only with a phantom. It is not (then)
<lb/>the inconsistencies of the acting man which we have as a
<lb/>subject of discussion—(although we proceed as if it were,
<lb/>and thus inevitably err,) but the whims and vacillations—the
<lb/>conflicting energies and indolences of the poet. It seems to
<lb/>us little less than a miracle, that this obvious point should
<lb/>have been overlooked.</p><p></p><p>While on this topic, we may as well offer an ill-considered
<lb/>opinion of our own as to the intention of the poet in the de-
<lb break="no"/>lineation of the Dane. It must have been well known to
<lb/>Shakspeare, that a leading feature in certain more intense
<lb/>classes of intoxication, (from whatever cause,) is an almost
<lb/>irresistible impulse to counterfeit a farther degree of excite-
<lb break="no"/>ment than actually exists. Analogy would lead any thought-
<lb break="no"/>ful person to suspect the same impulse in madness—where
<lb/>beyond doubt, it is manifest. This, Shakspeare felt—not
<lb/>thought. He felt it through his marvellous power of iden-
<lb break="no"/>tification with humanity at large—the ultimate source of his
<lb/>magical influence upon mankind. He wrote of Hamlet as if
<lb/>Hamlet he were; and having, in the first instance, imagined
<lb/>his hero excited to partial insanity by the disclosures of the
<lb/>ghost—he (the poet) felt that it was natural he should be
<lb/>impelled to exaggerate the insanity,</p><p></p><p>The Southern Literary Messenger, for August, is chiefly

Harpers' Illuminated and Pictorial Bible. No. 35.
</p><p>This number brings the work as far as the Thirteenth Chap-
<lb break="no"/>ter of Zechariah. There are three large and thirty-seven
<lb/>small designs, independently of the Initial Letters. The
<lb/>small cuts are without exception excellent, and many of
<lb/>them are not only admirable as mere specimens of wood
<lb/>engraving, but, as designs, belong to the highest class of art.
<lb/>We would refer especially to those illustrating verse 3 of
<lb/>the 3d Chapter of Nahum—verse 10 of the 3d Chapter of
<lb/>Habbakuk—verse 4 of the 2d Chapter of Zephaniah—verse 1
<lb/>of the 6th ; verse 13 of the 7th ; and verse 2d of the 10th
<lb/>Chapter of Zechariah. The heads of the Prophets are full
<lb/>of force and character.</p><p>There is evidently no falling off in any portion of this enter-
prise.
</p><p>Lest there be any one of our readers unacquainted with
<lb/>its whole scope, we state that this Bible is printed from the
<lb/>Standard Copy of the American Bible Society, and contains
<lb/>(or will contain) Marginal References, the Apocrypha, a Con-
<lb break="no"/>cordance, Chronological Table, List of Proper Names, Index,
<lb/>Table of Weights, Measures, &amp;c. The large Frontispieces,
<lb/>Titles to the Old and New Testaments, Family Record, Pre-
<lb break="no"/>sentation Plate, Historical Illustrations, Initial Letters, Or-
<lb break="no"/>namental Borders, &amp;c., are from original designs by Chap-
<lb break="no"/>man ; but, in addition, there will be numerous large engrav-
<lb break="no"/>ings from designs by distinguished foreign artists—sixteen</p><p><pb n="90"/>
</p><p>hundred engravings in all—exclusive of initial letters. The
<lb/>engraver is Adams. As there are no notes or comments
<lb/>upon the text, (which is the authorised version) there can be
<lb/>no objection to the edition on the score of sectarian prejudice,
<lb/>or opinion. Upon the whole it is the most magnificent Bible
<lb/>ever put to press.</p><p>The Duty of American Women to their Country. New
York : Harper &amp; Brothers.
</p><p>This volume is put forth anonymously, and has no preface.
<lb/>We know not who is the author, nor any circumstance con-
<lb break="no"/>nected with its publication. It may be, however, the work
<lb/>of Mrs. Kirkland. At all events it is the work of some wo-
<lb break="no"/>man of very bold and vigorous intellect—possibly of Mrs. </p><p></p><p>Child or Miss Fuller. Its propositions speak for themselves.
<lb/>The design is to arouse the country, and more especially
<lb/>its women, to the necessity of forwarding the cause of gene-
<lb break="no"/>ral education. Our deficiencies, in this respect, are vividly
<lb/>shown :—for example ;</p><p></p><p>Look, then, at the indications in our census. In a population of
<lb/>fourteen milions, we can find one milllion adults who cannot read and
<lb/>write, and two million of children without schools. In a few years,
<lb/>then, if these children come on the stage with their present neglect,
<lb/>we shall have three millions of adults managing our state and national
<lb/>affairs, who cannot even read the Constitution they swear to support,
<lb/>nor a word in the Bible, nor any newspaper or book, Look at the
<lb/>West, where our dangers from foreign immigration are the greatest,
<lb/>and which, by its unparalleled increase, is soon to hold the sceptre of
<lb/>power. In Indiana and Illinois scarcely one half of the children have
<lb/>any schools. Missouri and Iowa send a similar or worse report. In
<lb/>Virginia, one quarter of the white adults cannot even write their
<lb/>names to their applications for marriage license. In North Carolina,
<lb/>more than half the adults cannot read or write. The whole South, in
<lb/>addition to her ignorant slaves, returns more than half her white
<lb/>children as without schools.</p><p></p><p>This is, indeed, a lamentable picture, and not the least dis-
<lb break="no"/>tressing feature of it is its absolute truth. The remedy propos-
<lb break="no"/>ed, is the establisment of Seminaries for the education of
<lb/>teachers, as well female as male:—the superior qualifica-
<lb break="no"/>tions of woman for educational tasks in common schools, be-
<lb break="no"/>ing very decidedly shown—if Indeed there was ever any rea-
<lb break="no"/>sonable doubt on the subject.</p><p></p><p>The work is lucidly, earnestly, and vigorously written ;

<lb/>not to mistake ardor for folly—the enthusiastic for the vision-

The Crock of Gold. By Martin Farquhar Tupper.
</p><p>Mr. Willis, in one of his late Letters to the “ Mirror,” has
<lb/>said a good deal which may serve to excite interest in Mar-
<lb break="no"/>tin Farquhar Tupper. The only point about which the author
<lb/>of “ Melanie” is deceived, is the age of the author. Mr.
<lb/>Tupper, we believe, is a much older man than Mr. W. sup-</p><p></p><p>poses him. His talents, however, are scarcely overrated.
<lb/>“ The Crock of Gold” is a simple, picturesque story of com-
<lb break="no"/>mon life, and turns upon the danger aristing to the contented
<lb/>poor from suddenly and, in especial, from easily acquired
<lb/>wealth. The style is terse, succinct, and often sketchy. The
<lb/>narrative is skilfully managed, and frequently rises into
<lb/>what the critics now and then call “ power”—of which a
<lb/>specimen is to be found, commencing at page 108 of the vo-

THE FINE ARTS.
</p><p>To those who take any interest in the welfare of the vari-
<lb break="no"/>ous professions, it cannot but be a source of deep regret, to
<lb/>observe how much ill-feeling, jealousy, hatred, and all un-
<lb break="no"/>charitableness, exist in every grade of every profession. If
<lb/>these feelings were only called into action by cases of emi-
<lb break="no"/>nent success, we should not be so Quixotic as to attempt to
<lb/>wage war against their power; for our nature is so frail, that
<lb/>the success of one offends thousands, who, consequently, seek
<lb/>to depreciate the genius which soars far above the highest
<lb/>flight of their imagination. But it is not only the successful
<lb/>who have to battle with these bitter enemies; the humble
<lb/>and lowly are alike oppressed. They who, steeped to the
<lb/>very lips in poverty, struggle in obscurity for a scanty
<lb/>subsistence—who rise with the early cock-crow, and labor
<lb/>with heavy hearts almost against hope—they too suffer with
<lb/>the rest—their daily bread is mixed with bitterness. The
<lb/>artists of established reputation oppose the rising young
<lb/>men, who in their turn give back the cold shoulder with
<lb/>hearty ill-will, conscious that, with youth on their side, their
<lb/>day must come. And when that day does come, what is the</p><p><pb n="91"/>
</p><p>consequence? Does the experience of the past teach them wis-
<lb break="no"/>dom and moderation in their intercourse with others ? No! the
<lb/>oppression which they suffered in their youth, they repay 
<lb/>with interest to those who are struggling as they struggled;
<lb/>and thus the system of oppression descends from generation
<lb/>to generation, entailing misery upon thousands. Wo see
<lb/>them daily—hourly before our eyes, and we have traced their
<lb/>sad effect upon the advancement of Arts. What can be done i
<lb/>to remedy this state of things? What can we do to make
<lb/>men human ? How can we teach them to act towards their
<lb/>fellow men, as though the world were wide enough for all ?
<lb/>We can hardly hope to throw down one stone from this struc- 
<lb/>ture of prejudice, which long years of brooding maliceor open
<lb/>hostility, have tended only to increase or to strengthen. We
<lb/>will, however, endeavour to arrive at the cause of this sad 
<lb/>misconception. We believe it to arise chiefly from that most
<lb/>wretched of all habits—the habit of cliquing! Two or three
<lb/>men are thrown often together; their feelings are congenial;
<lb/>their tone of thought the same ; they view the Art and its
<lb/>necessities with the same eye; they are drawn together;
<lb/>they form a little banded circle, hedged in by prejudice, and
<lb/>guarded by a powerful sense of community of interest, into
<lb/>which none other dare enter. Their views become as con-
<lb break="no"/>tracted as their circle, and all who are not of them, they op-
<lb break="no"/>pose. This opposition begets opposition: new cliques are
<lb/>formed in self-defence, and thus a large body of intelligence,
<lb/>whose one great aim should be the advancement of Art, is
<lb/>split into small coteries, whose insignificant aim is party pur-
<lb break="no"/>poses. The Art is forgotten in their own individuality ; the
<lb/>cause is sacrificed at the altar of self aggrandizement.</p><p></p><p>The two great parties at present, are the old and the young
<lb/>artists. Each party is divided against itself, but each com-
<lb break="no"/>bines when the other is to be attacked. This feeling has i
<lb/>been fostered by some writers for the press, who, to gain fa-
<lb break="no"/>vor with one party, endeavor to set both by the ears. Such
<lb/>men should be noted and sent to Coventry by the whole—that
<lb/>is to say, if the whole body could act unanimously. We
<lb/>have no Utopian theory for human advancement to put forth ;
<lb/>we leave that desired end to time, which worketh wonders.
<lb/>We endeavour to find a remedy in things as they at present
<lb/>exist. We do not believe that the evils of which we com-
<lb break="no"/>plain, have so deep a foundation but that social intercourse <
<lb/>would remove them. Our nature is frail, but there is a well
<lb/>of kindly feeling in the human heart, which cannot, however
<lb/>we may cast in the dirt of this world, be entirely dammed up.
<lb/>The oldest established prejudices yield to familiar inter-
<lb break="no"/>course; then surely prejudices that are really only of the
<lb/>surface, though they sink deeper by habit, may be vanquish-
<lb break="no"/>ed by the same means. How many enemies at a distance
<lb/>become friends on meeting !</p><p></p><p>We therefore say—let the artists seek each other’s society
<lb/>indiscriminately. They know not how much manly and no-
<lb break="no"/>ble feeling and generous sympathy exist, where they sup-
<lb break="no"/>pose jealousy and bigotry alone have sway. Let the old
<lb/>stretch forth the hand of friendship to the young! They would
<lb/>find the response cordial, and thus combined, the Art could

We find the following in “The Sun,” but do not exactly
comprehend it.
</p><p>Mr. Sully, the well known and justly distinguished artist of Phil-
<lb break="no"/>adelphia, has just finished a truly admirable full length and life-size
<lb/>portrait of Gen. Jackson. It is from an original by Mr. S. and the
<lb/>dress is the United States’ uniform, over which is thrown in easy and
<lb/>graceful style, a military cloak. The effort is of the highest order of
<lb/>art, and may well be regarded as one of Sully’s best. The likeness,
<lb/>the coloring, the general effect, are all admirable.</p><p></p><p>Is the picture an original “ from an original” by Mr. S ?
<lb/>Or is the picture by the “justly distinguished Mr. Sully” at
<lb/>all? We had supposed it the work of the younger Sully
<lb/>—but do not pretend to know.</p><p></p><p>M. Martiner, of Paris, claims to have discovered the means
<lb/>of Daguerreotyping an entire panorama, embracing 150 de-
<lb break="no"/>grees—although we are at a loss to know how “ an entire
<lb/>panorama” (tautological) can be said to embrace only 150
<lb/>degrees. His process consists in curving the metallic plate,
<lb/>and causing the lens which reflects the landscape to turn by
<lb/>clockwork. The lens, in turning, passes over on one side
<lb/>the whole space to be Daguerreotyped, and on the other side
<lb/>moves the refracted luminous cone to the plate, to which
<lb/>the objects are successively conveyed.</p><p>We shall endeavour to give, in our next, a full account
of the paintings at the Rotunda. No tickets received.

<lb/>of fine talents—correct and tasteful as a singer—as an actor,
<lb/>admirable ! His place will not easily be filled in the com-
<lb break="no"/>pany of which he was a member. In private life he bore
<lb/>an estimable character, and was highly respected. Funeral
<lb/>honors were paid to him in the French Church, Canal street,
<lb/>and he was followed to the grave by a large body of the
<lb/>musical profession. Madame Cceuriot has not performed

Urban, a Page -	-      Mad’lle Richer
</p><p>The following is a short account of the plot. The first
<lb/>scene is a grand Banquet Hall in the mansion of the Comte
<lb/>de Nevers. All the gallants of the Court are present, and
<lb/>with them a young Protestant nobleman, Raoul. He tells
<lb/>them how he rescued from a band of libertines, a young, no-
<lb break="no"/>ble, and lovely lady, and how they became mutually and
<lb/>passionately attached. The merriment of the party is dis-
<lb break="no"/>turbed by Marcel, a stern old Huguenot, who, seeing his
<lb/>young lord Raoul feasting with his enemies, or rather with
<lb/>the enemies of his religion, endeavors to make him cease;
<lb/>but failing in his endeavors, he determines to stem the tide
<lb/>of licentiousness, and chants forth, in a voice of thunder, a
<lb/>Huguenot Chorale. The young lords, for the sake of Raoul,
<lb/>do not resent the insult. At this moment, the Comte de
<lb/>Nevers is called from the room, his presence being desired
<lb/>by a lady. The guests, being all pretty high from the ef-
<lb break="no"/>fects of the revel, are full of curiosity to learn who the fair
<lb/>lady may be. They peep through the curtain which con-
<lb break="no"/>ceals the window, and are enchanted by her beauty. They
<lb/>persuade Raoul to do the same. He advances, but is hor-
<lb break="no"/>ror-struck ; for the first glance reveals to him the lady of
<lb/>his love, in earnest and familiar converse with his host. The
<lb/>lady retires past the banquet hall, and the Count enters. All
<lb/>but Raoul congratulate him upon his conquest. Before any
<lb/>explanation can take place, the Queen’s Page enters, bear-
<lb break="no"/>ing a letter to Raoul. He opens it, and finds it an appoint-</p><p>ment, to which he is to be conducted blindfolded. He con-
sents to go, and shows the letter to all assembled ; the cour-
tiers know the Queen’s hand and seal, and congratulate Ra-
oul upon his favor.
</p><p>The second scene exhibits a view of the Queen’s gardens.
<lb/>The Queen is surrounded by her maids of honor. Her fav-
<lb break="no"/>orite, Valentine, approaches; Marguerite comforts her with
<lb/>the assurance that she shall be the wife of Raoul, who short-
<lb break="no"/>ly after is led in blindfolded. All the ladies retire, leaving
<lb/>the Queen alone with Raoul: he takes the bandage from his
<lb/>eyes, and is ravished at the fairy-like beauty of the scene,
<lb/>and the surpassing loveliness of the Queen, with whom he</p><p>at once falls desperately in love. Fickle Raoul! where was 
thy love for Valentine? The Queen finds herself in a deli-
cate situation, and observes that had she not promised to 
</p><p>win him for another, it would be a rare opportunity to gain
<lb/>him for herself. She promises him, however, that he shall
<lb/>have the lady whom he loves; and at this juncture, the
<lb/>courtiers enter to pay their respects to the Queen. Raoul
<lb/>then learns to whom he has been making love, and is over-
<lb break="no"/>whelmed with astonishment. He is introduced to the Comte
<lb/>de St. Bris, and the Queen declares that it being the dearest
<lb/>wish of the King, her husband, to unite the two great fac-
<lb break="no"/>tions, the Huguenot and the Catholic, in enduring bonds of
<lb/>unity, she has decided, in order to accomplish this end, to
<lb/>bestow the hand of Valentine, daughter of the Comte de
<lb/>St. Bris, upon Raoul. The Queen then leads Valentine from
<lb/>the midst of the ladies, and presents her to Raoul, who starts
<lb/>back with horror, and indignantly rejects her. A scene of
<lb/>great confusion lakes place, and high words pass between
<lb/>St. Bris and Raoul.</p><p></p><p>The third Act shows a chapel on the left, with a view of
<lb/>the distant country. Valentine enters the chapel to pass a few
<lb/>hours in prayer, previous to her marriage with Comte de
<lb/>Nevers, to whom she had been previously betrothed, although
<lb/>against her will. Marcel brings a letter from Raoul to St.
<lb/>Bris, which contains a challenge, though the bearer is igno-
<lb break="no"/>rant of its contents. St. Bris and others conspire to surround
<lb/>and kill Raoul. This plot is overheard by Valentine, who
<lb/>informs Marcel of it. Raoul and St. Bris meet, but before
<lb/>the plot can be carried into effect, Marcel shouts out his Cho-
<lb break="no"/>rale, and a number of Huguenot soldiers come to his aid.
<lb/>A scene of great confusion ensues, which is quelled by the
<lb/>appearance of the Queen. The Comte de Nevers then en-
<lb break="no"/>ters, and conveys the Queen and his affianced to celebrate
<lb/>the nuptials.</p><p></p><p>The fourth Act discovers Valentine alone in a chamber,
<lb/>she having escaped from the banquet. Raoul enters, having
<lb/>also stolen away, to speak one last word to one whom he so
<lb/>fondly loved, and by whom he was so basely deceived. A
<lb/>hurried explanation ensues — he finds that he has been the
<lb/>victim of suspicious circumstances; that Valentine only vis-
<lb break="no"/>ited the Comte de Nevers to annul the contract of marriage
<lb/>existing between the Count and herself for years; she never
<lb/>having loved him, and being now under the influence of a
<lb/>first passion. In the midst of his regrets at his want of con-
<lb break="no"/>fidence, at his headlong jealousy, footsteps are heard, and he
<lb/>has scarcely time to conceal himself behind some drapery,
<lb/>when St. Bris, de Nevers, accompanied by others, enter the
<lb/>room. St. Bris requests his daughter to withdraw, as he has
<lb/>secrets of importance to impart; she is, however, permitted
<lb/>to remain at the desire of her husband. The dreadful secret
<lb/>of the Massacre is then disclosed. De Nevers indignantly
<lb/>refuses to join the conspiracy, declaring that he would rath-
<lb break="no"/>er die than tarnish the bright name of his family, or the
<lb/>sword which he has borne in honorable conflict. St. Bris
<lb/>causes him to be at once arrested; then, forgetful of the
<lb/>presence of Valentine, the signal for the commencement of
<lb/>the Massacre, and the mode of action, are arranged. Three
<lb/>priests then enter, who sanctify the daggers destined ere long
<lb/>to reek with Christian blood. They depart. Raoul, who
<lb/>has heard the whole of the dreadful design, almost stupified
<lb/>with horror, rushes from bis concealment, and is on the point
<lb/>of leaving the palace, when he is stopped by Valentine, who
<lb/>urges him to remain where he is, secure from the daggers
<lb/>of the assassins. He pleads his honor, duty, and love to the
<lb/>friends about to be sacrificed. Valentine, in despair, con-
<lb break="no"/>fesses how deeply she loves him, and for her sake begs him</p><p><pb n="93"/>
</p><p>to remain ; for a moment the delirium of passion triumphs,
<lb/>and he forgets all in the happiness of love returned. But
<lb/>the tolling of the Bell—the signal of the Massacre—arouses
<lb/>him from a dream of bliss; and, regardless of all entreaty,
<lb/>he leaps from the window, and Valentine falls as dead upon
<lb/>the ground. The fifth Act brings the terrible drama to an
<lb/>end. Raoul, after leaping from the window, encounters the
<lb/>faithful Marcel, who is wounded to death. They are joined
<lb/>by Valentine, who, regardless of all danger, follows to save
<lb/>her lover. Marcel relates how the noble de Nevers died in
<lb/>the endeavor to save him from the mob. Valentine, finding
<lb/>herself released from a tie she never sought, abjuring a re-
<lb break="no"/>ligion which sanctified wholesale murder and indiscriminate
<lb/>massacre, consents to fly with Raoul. They are, however,
<lb/>intercepted, and die together.</p><p></p><p>Of the chief actors in this piece, we cannot speak too
<lb/>highly. On no occasion has M’lle Calve exhibited so much
<lb/>excellence. In the fourth Act, her singing and her acting
<lb/>were beyond cavil. Her wild and passionate endeavors to
<lb/>restrain Raoul, and her overwhelming despair at his escape,
<lb/>reached, from the beginning to the end, the highest point of
<lb/>artistic excellence. So powerfully were the feelings of the
<lb/>audience excited, that the applause continued until it was
<lb/>thought advisable to raise the curtain, so that Calve, and
<lb/>Arnaud, (who deserved the like compliment, might receive
<lb/>a token of the public admiration. We regret that we are
<lb/>unable, this week, to enlarge upon the great merits of these
<lb/>artists, for though it would be a labor of love, a want of
<lb/>space denies us this indulgence.</p><p></p><p>Messrs. Douvry, Garry, and Bernard, were excellent in
<lb/>their respective parts; and Madame Casini, though sadly de-
<lb break="no"/>ficient in power, and M’lle Richer, received, and deservedly,
<lb/>much applause.</p><p>Of the music we shall speak, in our next, in connection
with Robert le Diable by the same author.
The Opera was got out in most magnificent style.
The Drama.
</p><p>The most important theatrical event (in New York) since
<lb/>we spoke last of the drama, has been the opening of the
<lb/>New Bowery Theatre by Mr. A. W. Jackson, as Manager
<lb/>and Proprietor. The house is very large, and may even ac-
<lb break="no"/>commodate 4000 persons. Its general arrangements are ex-
<lb break="no"/>cellent. The stage is capacious, and well appointed.
<lb/>Much of the scenery is well painted and effective—but the
<lb/>wild forest scenes are grossly exaggerated and unnatural, and
<lb/>the drop curtain is atrocious. These broad appeals to the
<lb/>patriotism of an audience, at the expense of their good taste
<lb/>and common sense, are out of date and should be abandoned.
<lb/>There is not a Pittite who would not look with greater rel-
<lb break="no"/>ish at a glowing landscape than at a rigmarole burlesque up-
<lb break="no"/>on Washington, even although perched upon a high pedes-
<lb break="no"/>tal and surrounded by Corinthian columns.</p><p>The boxes and gallery are what is called “ elegant” rath-
er than gaudy—but a little more of the gaudiness would be
</p><p>better taste, and infinitely more to the purpose. The pan-
<lb break="no"/>neling lacks color—as it now stands it has rather a Quaker-
<lb break="no"/>ish air—and this evil is increased by the hue of the plaster on
<lb/>the walls. If these latter were showily papered, the in-
<lb break="no"/>crease of effect would surprise every one. We think, too,
<lb/>that, in so large a theatre, a little more light upon the au-
<lb break="no"/>dience would be desirable. Unquestionably there should be
<lb/>two additional rows of chandeliers—one on the lower boxes,
<lb/>and one on the gallery.</p><p></p><p>The theatre has been crowded every night since its open-
<lb break="no"/>ing. The performances have been “ Money,” “ Nick of the
<lb/>Woods,” “Richelieu,” “Damon and Pythias” and “The
<lb/>Sleeping Beauty.” The latter piece has been brought out very
<lb/>effectively, and elicited great applause. Among the com-
<lb break="no"/>pany are J. R. Scott, Henkins, Hadaway, Davenport, Mrs.
<lb/>Philips, Mrs. Sergeant, Mrs. Isherwood, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p><p></p><p>The Park has been doing well with the French troupe,
<lb/>for a detailed account of “ Les Huguenots” see another part
<lb/>of the paper.</p><p></p><p>At Niblo's, Burton, the Placides, Chippendale, John Sef-
<lb break="no"/>ton, Brougham, Miss Taylor and other celebrities have been
<lb/>“ drawing crowded houses.”</p><p>Castle Garden has been a little depressed, but is reviv-
ing.
</p><p>At Palmo’s a German company have made a successful
<lb/>commencement. On the 8th inst. the house was opened for
<lb/>the benefit of Mess. Stuyvesant and Harris, when Mr. and
<lb/>Mrs. Flynn, with Winans, appeared. Mrs. Flynn (who is
<lb/>a capital actress not sufficiently appreciated) evinced great
<lb/>talent and a very rare versatility in “Perfection,” “The
<lb/>Four Sisters,” and “ The Loan of a Lover.”</p><p>Mr. Flynn’s theatre, we learn, is making rapid progress.

</p><p>Misrepresentation is not only one of the commonest but
<lb/>one of the most despicable tricks resorted to, for its own pur-
<lb break="no"/>poses, by the more depraved portion of the press. From this
<lb/>more depraved portion we look for it—all honest men look
<lb/>for it as a matter of course—and, when here observed, it is
<lb/>seldom by any one, and never by us, considered as meriting
<lb/>or requiring reply. “ The Evening Gazette,” then, will give
<lb/>us credit for very sincerely respecting it, (or at least the per-
<lb break="no"/>sonal character of its editors) since we put ourselves to the
<lb/>trouble of taking it to task for some words of sheer misrepre-
<lb break="no"/>sentation which appeared in one of its late numbers, under
<lb/>the heading of “ The Knickerbocker and The American Re-</p><p></p><p>view.” In alluding to an article, by ourselves, contained
<lb/>in the latter Magazine, the Gazette says, in substance: “ Mr.
<lb/>Poe, however, is one of those who can never find anything
<lb/>to admire in anything written by Mr. Longfellow.”</p><p></p><p>Now this is doing us the grossest injustice—and this no
<lb/>one better knows than the inditer of the accusation. For ev-
<lb break="no"/>ery one paragraph written by any one person in America,
<lb/>commending Mr. Longfellow, we can point to ten similar
<lb/>paragraphs of our own. From Mr. L.’s first appearance in
<lb/>the literary world until the present moment, we have been,
<lb/>if not his warmest admirer and most steadfast defender, at
<lb/>least one of his warmest and most steadfast. We even so
<lb/>far committed ourselves in a late public Lecture, as to place
<lb/>him (without sufficient consideration) at the very head of
<lb/>American poets. Yet, because we are not so childish as to
<lb/>suppose that every book is thoroughly good or thoroughly
<lb/>bad—because we are not so absurd as to adopt the common
<lb/>practice of wholesale and indiscriminate abuse or commenda-
<lb break="no"/>tion—because upon several occasions we have thought prop-
<lb break="no"/>er to demonstrate the sins, while displaying the virtues of
<lb/>Professor Longfellow, is it just, or proper, or even courteous
<lb/>on the part of “ The Gazette" to accuse us, in round terms,
<lb/>of uncompromising hostility to this poet ?</p><p><pb n="94"/>
</p><p>We make use of the word “ demonstrate”—for it has al-
<lb break="no"/>ways been a point with us to sustain as far as possible, by
<lb/>evidence or argument, whatever propositions we put forth.
<lb/>But has “ The Gazette,” in the present instance, been equally
<lb/>careful ? Do we understand it as inclined to dispute the ac-
<lb break="no"/>curacy of any statement, or the validity of any deduction, em-
<lb break="no"/>bodied in the critique to which it has referred ? If so, we
<lb/>are prepared to try the case upon its merits. If, however,
<lb/>it is the simple opinion of “The Gazette” which is thus pit-
<lb break="no"/>ted against our own—we are by far too modest to say anoth-
<lb break="no"/>er word upon the subject—and must submit to the stern ne-
<lb break="no"/>cessity of letting the whole matter remain precisely where it
<lb/>is.</p><p></p><p>For the frank admission that our criticism is “worth read-
<lb break="no"/>ing ” we very cordially return thanks—but we have been
<lb/>considering whether any temptation (short of a copy of “ Is-
<lb break="no"/>abel”) could induce us to make any similar acknowledge-
<lb break="no"/>ment in regard to any criticisms of “ The Evening Gazette.”</p><p></p><p>The very just observations which follow are from the
<lb/>pen of one of the most distinguished of American novelists—
<lb/>William Gilmore Simms.</p><p></p><p>The original “ Library” of Wiley and Putnam was meant to be
<lb/>composed of European writings chiefly. As an offset and parallel
<lb/>scheme to this, the same publishers have conceived the idea of an
<lb/>American collection on a similar plan. It is for the American public
<lb/>to determine, whether this latter, and highly patriotic purpose, shall
<lb/>receive their countenance. The American series necessarily labors
<lb/>under a disadvantage to which the English is not subject. The works
<lb/>constituting the latter collection, are, not only obtained by the pub-
<lb break="no"/>-lishers for nothing, but they are at liberty to choose the very best pro-
<lb break="no"/>-ductions of the London market and the quality and character of these
<lb/>works are indicated, to their hands, by the imprimatur of the foreign,
<lb/>and, if need be, the domestic critic. In procuring the works of the
<lb/>American series, the case is very different. In the first place, the na-
<lb break="no"/>tive author requires pay for his writings.—As he has no English public
<lb/>among which to secure his copyright, the home market is required to
<lb/>do for him all that it can, by way of giving him compensation for his
<lb/>labor. This is a charge on the pocket and patriotism of the publisher ;
<lb/>and, when it is remembered that he can procure from the British press,
<lb/>a hundred times as many books as he has capital to print, all saleable,
<lb/>and many good,—some credit is certainly due to him for this disinter-
<lb break="no"/>ested and generous proceeding in behalf of native literature ; and we
<lb/>may reasonably hope that the public will not suffer its patriotism to be
<lb/>outdone by that of its publisher. He risks his thousands, where, if
<lb/>seconded by the public, each citizen will expend a trifle only. Nor is
<lb/>it in the cost of copyright merely, that the difference exists between
<lb/>the English and American copy. In the former, he prints from a clear
<lb/>type, in the latter from an imperfect manuscript;—in the former, he
<lb/>prints from a book that has already obtained the European verdict of
<lb/>English criticism ; in the latter, he has this criticism to encounter,
<lb/>and may be purchasing and publishing an inferior production, when his
<lb/>earnest wish is for the very best. This statement beiefly displays
<lb/>the several difficulties under which the business of the domestic pub-
<lb break="no"/>lisher labors ; and, in his case, as in that of the author, demands all
<lb/>the indulgence that the patriotism of the citizen, solicitous of the es-
<lb break="no"/>tablishment of a native literature, should be ready to accord. Influ-
<lb break="no"/>enced necessarily by these considerations, and by reasonable appre-
<lb break="no"/>hensions of loss, the publisher hesitates to pay largely for any native
<lb/>manuscript. Suppose a work offered him by an author, hitherto un-
<lb break="no"/>known, but one of the most unquestionable excellence and originality,
<lb/>he has been engaged upon this work, without intermission. He has
<lb/>elaborated it with care. The labor limae has not been withheld; and
<lb/>when he conceives it perfect he presents it to the publisher, from
<lb/>whom he demands one thousand dollars for the copyright. This sum,
<lb/>stated as the charge for one year of clerk hire, would not perhaps be
<lb/>considered extravagant in the instance of a clerk of first rate ability ;
<lb/>yet such a charge for a book, the preparation of which consumed all
<lb/>that time, would stagger the liberality even of the most patriotic pub-
<lb break="no"/>lisher, particularly in the case of an experiment, undertaken purely for
<lb/>love of country, and with funds that might otherwise be invested with
<lb/>equal safety and much greater profit in English publications. This is</p><p></p><p>a simple statement of the case to which we solicit the attention of the
<lb/>citizen. We trust that there will be a class of the American people,
<lb/>sufficiently large, who will propose it to themselves, as a duty which
<lb/>they owe the country, to second the attempt of these publishers, in be-
<lb break="no"/>half of a native literature, by buying regularly the volumes of this se-
<lb break="no"/>ries, as they severally make their appearance. They may sometimes
<lb/>buy an inferior book, but we guarantee that they will never get a bad
<lb/>one. The works generally may be of less value than the picked pub-
<lb break="no"/>lications of the British series, but they will be native, they will possess
<lb/>a character of their own, and they may be at the foundation of future
<lb/>publications which shall vie with the best of foreign origin. Thus far
<lb/>the issue of the “ Library of American Books,” will scarcely shrink
<lb/>from comparison with the other. The letters of Headley from Italy,
<lb/>form a fresh and delightful volume, worthy of the same shelves with
<lb/>“ Eothen” and“ The Crescent and the Cross.” The “ Journal of an
<lb/>African Cruiser,” and the Tales of Edgar A. Poe, forming the second
<lb/>and third works in this series, shall receive our notice hereafter. We
<lb/>rejoice to learn that these publications find a ready sale and circula-
<lb break="no"/>tion, and sincerely trust that the praiseworthy scheme of the publish-
<lb break="no"/>rs will be sustained by the people.</p><p></p><p>Samuel Colman, of Boston, has in preparation a Selection

<lb/>Romance." Here we were mistaken. The design is far
<lb/>more comprehensive. It will include many historical and
<lb/>other works of value.</p><p></p><p>We find it stated, that “ The Southern Literary Messen-
<lb break="no"/>ger” published in Morgan county, Georgia, bears aloft the
<lb/>flag:</p><p>For President in 1848,
Henry Clay.”
</p><p>Is there such a paper as “ The Southern Literary Messen-
<lb break="no"/>ger” published in Georgia? If so, is not the title a shame-
<lb break="no"/>ful spoliation?</p><p></p><p>There is quite a revival in the American poetical world.
<lb/>Besides the collection of Specimens of which we have already
<lb/>spoken, we shall have in the fall, from Clark and Austen, a
<lb/>volume by Mrs. Osgood, one by Alfred B. Street, and one by
<lb/>H. T. Tuckerman—from J. S. Redfield a volume by Mrs. Se-
<lb break="no"/>ba Smith—and from some other publisher a volume by Em-
<lb break="no"/>erson. One or two other collections are in posse—by poets
<lb/>whose names we have no authority to mention.</p><p>The Tribune says:
</p><p>We learn from a private letter that Miss Martineau is building a
<lb/>cottage at Faxhow,a mile from Wordsworth’s residence. Our Bryant
<lb/>was about visiting her. Wordsworth, hearing of Bryant’s arrival,
<lb/>welcomed him to his home with great hospitality. Wordsworth,
<lb/>though 76 years old, is hale and vigorous. Miss Martineau continues
<lb/>perfectly well, and is extending the benefit of Magnetic treatment to
<lb/>other sufferers.</p><p></p><p>We refer our readers to the “ London Lancet” (for June
<lb/>we believe) for a very interesting expose of the circumstances
<lb/>attending Miss Martineau’s Magnetics. We have firm faith
<lb/>in Mesmerism—but not in all that Miss Martineau dreams
<lb/>of it.</p><p></p><p>The “Albany Evening Journal” states on the faith of a
<lb/>private letter from Dublin, that Henry Russell the vocalist, is
<lb/>there passing himself oft as an American. Why not? The
<lb/>Americans should feel flattered—and no doubt they do.</p><p><pb n="95"/>
</p><p>“ The Aristidean,” suspended for a brief period for politi-
<lb break="no"/>cal reasons, will be immediately resumed—under the con-
<lb break="no"/>duct, of course, of its spirited editor, Thomas Dunn English.</p><p>Mrs. Sigourney, we regret to learn, is still seriously ill at
Hartford.
</p><p>We announced in our last, that Mr. T. S. Arthur was
<lb/>preparing an Annual to be published by E. Ferret &amp; Co.—but
<lb/>were not then informed of its title. It is to be called “ The
<lb/>Snow-Flake and Gift for Innocence and Beauty.”</p><p></p><p>The proof-reader of the August number of Godey has
<lb/>made us say of Mr. Lowell’s “Conversations” what indeed
<lb/>we should be very sorry to say, viz :</p><p></p><p>The farce of this big book is equalled only by the farce of the rag-
<lb break="no"/>tag-and-bobtail embassy from the whole earth, introduced by the cra-
<lb break="no"/>zy Prussian into the Hall of the French National Assembly. The au-
<lb break="no"/>thor is the Anacharsis Clootz of American Letters.</p><p></p><p>By the omission of a dash, this paragraph was made part
<lb/>and parcel of our commentary on Mr. Lowell—to whom it
<lb/>had no reference whatever.</p><p>To Correspondents.—Mr. Thomas W. Field will find a letter for
him at the office of the “ Broadway Journal."

THIS DAY IS PUBLISHED,
VERSE AND PROSE, by Thomas Hood—Part 1,
forming No. 16 of the Library of Choice Reading, beautifully
printed. Price 50 cents.
</p><p>“ Of all the humorists, Hood was the most poetical. When deal-
<lb break="no"/>ing with the most familiar subjects, whether it might be a sweep be-
<lb break="no"/>wailing the suppression of his cry, or a mother searching through St.
<lb/>Giles’s for her lost infant, or a Miss Kilmansegg’s golden childhood—
<lb/>there was hardly a verse in which some touches of heart, or some play
<lb/>of fancy, did not beckon the laughing reader away into far other
<lb/>worlds than the jester’s.”—London Athenaeum.</p><p></p><p>“ The smile and the sigh were ever blended together; the laugh at
<lb/>the grotesque idea and whimsical imagination, (rarely seeing objects
<lb/>as others saw them,) and the tear which must now on such pathetic
<lb/>narratives as Eugene Aram or the Old Elm Tree. Without a parallel
<lb/>and original as Hood was in the ludicrous, his more enduring fame
<lb/>will rest on the exquisitely humane and simply compassionate.”—Lite-
<lb break="no"/>rary Gazette.</p><p></p><p>“ He was the inventer of a new sort of guano to fertilize men’s
<lb/>minds, and to make them produce larger crops of good actions: or rath-
<lb break="no"/>er it was an intellectual compost that he invented, and the materials
<lb/>of which were satire softened by kindness, and ridicule tempered with
<lb/>good feeling.”—Hood’s Magazine for June. Published and for sale

GOLD PEN.
THIS PEN RECEIVED THE HIGHEST PRE-

<lb break="no"/>nounced by the First Teachers of Penmanship in the country, to be
<lb/>infinitely superior to any Gold Pen ever before introduced to the Ame-
<lb break="no"/>rican public. The lasting properties of this Pen are undoubted, owing
<lb/>to the total absence of corrosibility from any of the inks in use; and the
<lb/>peculiar shape of the nibs—which was first introduced by Bagley—
<lb/>makes it more pleasant to use, renders it less liable to damage, more
<lb/>easy to repair, and prevents the necessity of the great care that other
<lb/>articles of the kind require.</p><p>MANUFACTORY, 189 BROADWAY, NEW YORK.
BERTINI’S METHOD FOR THE PIANO.
</p><p>THIS is the only thorough, complete and progressive work
<lb/>yet published in this country. Where pupils have used this me-
<lb break="no"/>thod, the most rapid advancement has been observed in all cases.
<lb/>The most prominent feature of this work is that the lessons, exerci-
<lb break="no"/>ses, scales and studies are given in such progressive order, that they
<lb/>enlist the interest of pupils, and carry them almost imperceptibly
<lb/>through those mechanical difficulties which, otherwise, are too often
<lb/>made irksome in other instruction books. The time has arrived when
<lb/>a superficial knowledge of the Piano is of but little account, and it is
<lb/>only by the study of such methods as Bertini’s that pupils will be ena-
<lb break="no"/>bled to read music with facility, and at the same time become good
<lb/>musicians.</p><p></p><p>This method commences in the most plain and simple manner ; the
<lb/>rudiments of music being given and illustrated at the same lime, and
<lb/>each lesson is fully explained by marginal notes on the same page.</p><p></p><p>The publishers are in possession of the highest recommendations
<lb/>from professional gentlemen, who speak of the superior merits of
<lb/>Bertini’s Method over all others yet published in this country, most
<lb/>of them hiving used the foreign copies previously. It will only bo
<lb/>necessary to give a few of the names in the principal cities.</p><p>Boston.	New-York.
