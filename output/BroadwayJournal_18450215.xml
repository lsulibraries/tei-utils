</p><p>Truth, whether in or cut of fashion, is the measure of knowledge and the busi-
<lb break="no"/>ness of the understanding; whatsoever is beside that, however authorised by con-
<lb break="no"/>sent or recommended by variety, is nothing but ignorance, or something worse.</p><p>Locke.
REVIEWS.
Woman in the Nineteenth Century.
</p><p>This is the title of a book now in press in this city, which
<lb/>will be likely to excite a good deal of remark, for and against.
<lb/>It is from the pen of Margaret Fuller, a woman of more
<lb/>powerful intellect, comprehensive thought, and thorough
<lb/>education, than any other American authoress, with whose
<lb/>productions I am acquainted. Her style is vigorous and sig-
<lb break="no"/>nificant, abounding with eloquent passages, and affluent in il-
<lb break="no"/>lustration ; but it is sometimes rough in construction, and its
<lb/>meaning is not always sufficiently clear. This does not arise
<lb/>from affectation, or pedantic elaboration; it is the defect of a
<lb/>mind that has too many thoughts for its words ; an excess by
<lb/>no means common, either in men or women. She is a con-
<lb break="no"/>tralto voice in literature: deep, rich, and strong, rather than
<lb/>mellifluous and clear.</p><p></p><p>The book in question is written in a free energetic spirit.
<lb/>It contains a few passages that will offend the fastidiousness
<lb/>of some readers; for they allude to subjects which men do
<lb/>not wish to have discussed, and which women dare not ap-
<lb break="no"/>proach. But the clean-minded will not sneer; for they will
<lb/>see that the motive is pure, and the object is to ennoble hu-</p><p>man nature.
</p><p>There is a great deal of unuttered thought and suppressed
<lb/>feeling, concerning the terrible discords of society, as it now
<lb/>exists. The passion of love, divorced from the pure and ele-
<lb break="no"/>vating sentiment, is felt to be unsatisfactory, as well as de- 
<lb/>grading. More and more earnestly rise the questions, “ Is
<lb/>love a mockery, and marriage a sham? What is woman’s
<lb/>true mission ? What is the harmonious relation of the sex-
<lb break="no"/>es ?”</p><p></p><p>This extending murmur of the human heart, this increas-
<lb break="no"/>ing conviction that woman should be the friend, the compa-
<lb break="no"/>nion, the real partner of man in all his pursuits, rather than
<lb/>the mere ornament of his parlor, or the servant of his senses,
<lb/>cannot be silenced.</p><p></p><p>The author of “Woman in the Nineteenth Century,” has
<lb/>uttered noble aspirations on this subject, rather than definite
<lb/>theories. She is wise enough to see, that to purify the at-
<lb break="no"/>mosphere will gradually affect all forms of life.</p><p>I quote a few passages at random, to give some idea of the
import and tendencies of the book.
</p><p>“A better comment could not be made on what is required to per-
<lb break="no"/>fect man, and place him in that superior position for which he was
<lb/>designed, than by the interpretation of Bacon upon the legends of the
<lb/>Syren coast. When the wise Ulysses passed, says he, he caused his
<lb/>mariners to stop their ears with wax, knowing there was no power to
<lb/>resist the lure of that voluptuous song. But he, the much experienced
<lb/>man, who wished to be experienced in all, anil use all to the service
<lb/>of wisdom, desired to hear the song that he might understand its
<lb/>meaning. Yet, distrusting his own owu power to be firm in his better
<lb/>purpose, he caused himself to be bound to the mast, that he might be
<lb/>kept secure against his own weakness. But Orpheus passed unfetter-
<lb break="no"/>ed, so absorbed in singing hymns to the gods, that he could not even
<lb/>bear those sounds of degrading enchantment.</p><p></p><p>“ Meanwhile not a few believe, and men themselves have express-
<lb break="no"/>ed the opinion, that the time is come when Eurydice is to call for an
<lb/>Orpheus, rather than Orpheus for Eurydice : that the idea of Man,</p><p></p><p>however imperfectly brought out, has been far more so than that of
<lb/>Woman ; that she, the other half of the same thought, the other
<lb/>chamber of the heart of life, needs now to take her turn in the full
<lb/>pulsation, and that improvement in the daughters will best aid in the
<lb/>reformation of the sons of this age.</p><p></p><p>“ It should be remarked that, as the principle of liberty is better un-
<lb break="no"/>derstood, and more nobly interpreted a broader protest is made in be-
<lb break="no"/>half of Woman. As men become aware that few men have had a fair
<lb/>chance, they are inclined to say that no women have had a fair
<lb/>chance.</p><p></p><p>“ Without attaching importance, in themselves, to the changes de-
<lb break="no"/>manded by the champions of woman, we hail them as signs of the
<lb/>times. We would have every arbitrary barrier thrown down. We
<lb/>would have every path laid open to woman as freely as to man.
<lb/>Were this done and a slight temporary fermentation allowed to sub-
<lb break="no"/>side, we should see crystallizations more pure and of more various
<lb/>beauty. We believe the divine energy would pervade nature to a de-
<lb break="no"/>gree unknown in the history of former ages, and that no discordant
<lb/>collision, but a ravishing harmony of the spheres would ensue.</p><p></p><p>'Yet, then and only then, will mankind be ripe for this, when in-
<lb break="no"/>ward and outward freedom for woman as much as for man shall be
<lb/>acknowledged as a right, not yielded as a concession. As the friend
<lb/>of the negro assumes that that one man cannot by right, hold another
<lb/>in bondage, so should the friend of woman assume that man cannot,
<lb/>by right, lay even well-meant restrictions on woman. If the negro be
<lb/>a soul, if the woman be a soul, apparelled in flesh, to one Master only
<lb/>are they accountable. There is but one law for souls, and if there is to
<lb/>be an interpreter of it, he must come not as man. or son of man, but
<lb/>as son of God.</p><p></p><p>"Were thought and feeling once so far elevated, that man should
<lb/>esteem himself the brother and friend, but nowise the lord and tutor of
<lb/>woman, were he really bound with her in equal worship, arrangements
<lb/>as to function and employment would be of no consequence. What
<lb/>woman needs is not as a woman to act or rule, but as a nature to grow,
<lb/>as an intellect to discern, as a soul to live freely and unimpeded, to
<lb/>unfold such powers as were given her when we left our common home.
<lb/>If fewer talents are given her, yet if allowed the free and full employ-
<lb break="no"/>ment of these, so that she may render back to the giver his own with
<lb/>usury, she will not complain ; nay, I dare to say she will bless and
<lb/>rejoice in her earthly birth-place, her earthly lot.</p><p>“ Man, in the order of time, was developed first; as energy comes
before harmony; power before beauty.
“ Woman was therefore under his care as an elder. He might have
been her guardian and teacher.
</p><p>“ But as human nature goes not straight forward, but by excessive
<lb/>action and then reaction in an undulated course, he misunderstood and
<lb/>abused his advantages, and became her temporal master instead of
<lb/>her spiritual sire.</p><p>ii On himself came the punishment. He educated woman more as a
servant than a daughter, and found himself a king without a queen.
</p><p>“The children of this unequal union showed unequal natures, and,
<lb/>more and more, men seemed sons of the hand-maid, rather than
<lb/>princes.</p><p>• •••••••
</p><p>ii The civilized world is still in a transition state about marriage ;
<lb/>not only in practice, but in thought. It is idle to speak with contempt
<lb/>of the nations where polygamy is an institution, or seraglios a custom,
<lb/>when practices far more debasing haunt, well nigh fill, every city and
<lb/>every town. And so far as union of one with one is believed to be the
<lb/>only pure form of marriage, a great majority of societies and individ-
<lb break="no"/>uals are still doubtful whether the earthly bond must be a meeting of
<lb/>souls, or only supposes a contract of convenience and utility. Were
<lb/>woman established in the rights of an immortal being, this could not
<lb/>be. She would not, in some countries, be given away by her father,
<lb/>with scarcely more respect than is shown by the Indian chief, who
<lb/>sells his daughter for a horse, and beats her if she runs away from
<lb/>her new home. Nor in societies where her choice is left free, would
<lb/>she be perverted, by the current of opinion that seizes her, into the
<lb/>belief that she must marry, if it be only to find a protector, and a
<lb/>home of her own.</p><p></p><p>“ Neither would man, if he thought the connection of permanent
<lb/>importance, form it so lightly. He would not deem it a trifle, that he
<lb/>was to enter into the closest relations with another soul, which, if not
<lb/>eternal in themselves, must eternally affect his growth.</p><p></p><p>“ Neither, did he believe woman capable of friendship, would he, by
<lb/>rash haste, lose the chance of finding a friend in the person who
<lb/>might, probably, live half a century by his side. Did love, in his
<lb/>mind, stretch forth into infinity, he'would not miss in his chance of
<lb/>its revelations, that he might, the sooner, rest from his weariness by a
<lb/>bright fireside, and secure a sweet and graceful attendant “ devoted to
<lb/>him alone.” Were be a step higher, he would not carelessly enter
<lb/>into a relation where he might not be able to do the duty of a friend,
<lb/>as well as protector from external ill, to the other party, and have a
<lb/>being in his power pining for sympathy, intelligence and aid, that he
<lb/>could not give.”	L. M. C.</p><p><pb n="98"/>
Rome ; as Seen by a New Yorker in 1843-4. New York and London.
Wiley &amp; Putnam, 1846. 12mo. pp. 216.
</p><p>The author of this book is William M. Gillespie, whose
<lb/>initials were familiar to readers a year or two ago, append-
<lb break="no"/>ed to a series of traveller’s letters from Europe in the Tri-
<lb break="no"/>bune. Italy attracted most of the writer’s attention. There
<lb/>were several descriptive sketches of Venice and Florence;
<lb/>while Rome, in consideration of the extent and unity of the
<lb/>subject, was reserved for the present volume. It is an ex-
<lb break="no"/>cellent book of a traveller's first visit to the imperial city;
<lb/>describing such objects and scenes as all have to see, metho-
<lb break="no"/>dising a great deal of miscellaneous knowledge in small
<lb/>compass, and valuable alike to the people who journey and
<lb/>those who read at home. If one wants to be in the position
<lb/>with respect to information and the reception of future ideas
<lb/>he would be in after a diligent six weeks at Rome, let him
<lb/>read this book. It clears away all the matter-of-fact duty
<lb/>of sight seeing, in a pleasant way, and prepares the way for
<lb/>new thought or observation. It is not the book of a classical
<lb/>antiquarian, or a book of personal adventure; but it tells us
<lb/>what a well-informed man sees about him, on first going to
<lb/>Rome. The philosophy of the people, and new moral and
<lb/>social speculations, come afterwards.</p><p></p><p>General good sense, a pains-taking eye and a careful style,
<lb/>are the characteristics of the volume. The subjects are con-
<lb break="no"/>veniently arranged in groups, beginning with St. Peter’s, and
<lb/>ending with a valuable classification of the various sights in
<lb/>a chapter entitled “ How to see Rome.” The time, it should
<lb/>be remarked, to which our traveller’s visit was limited, is
<lb/>mid winter, which introduces the ceremonies of Christmas,
<lb/>and excludes those of Easter and the Holy Week.</p><p></p><p>Our writer sometimes carries the remark to do in Rome as
<lb/>the Romans do, rather too far. Thus in the chapter on Re-
<lb break="no"/>liques, after an enumeration of various pitiable delusions,
<lb/>when we expect the atmosphere to be purged by a good
<lb/>hearty laugh from the author, he tells us that though “ De-
<lb break="no"/>mocritus -would laugh at all these things, and Heraclitus
<lb/>would weep, we travel to very little purpose if we do not
<lb/>learn charity to every sincere belief, however it may seem to
<lb/>us; remembering that our own may seem equally so to a more
<lb/>enlightened order of beings." This is neither sense nor
<lb/>benevolence. For that is no charity at all, when a man has
<lb/>to sink his understanding to practice the virtue. If man be-
<lb break="no"/>comes wiser when he is an angel, so much the better. But
<lb/>is that any reason why he should throw away any little wis-
<lb break="no"/>dom he has got on the earth? Let us hold on to what we
<lb/>have, and call ignorance ignorance and delusion delusion.
<lb/>In patronizing folly after our author’s fashion, we are encou-
<lb break="no"/>raging the accompanying knavery.</p><p></p><p>It is a hit in much better style at the implicit Romish ido-
<lb break="no"/>latry, when Mr. Gillespie tells us a story of one of the atten-
<lb break="no"/>dants at the Vatican, who, learning that he was an American,
<lb/>showed him some idols from the Western Hemisphere, and
<lb/>wondered he did not fall down and worship them !</p><p></p><p>In similar unconsciousness of his good American under-
<lb break="no"/>standing, in that affair of the apology for the reliques, is the
<lb/>somewhat astonishing sentence after an account of the Inqui-
<lb break="no"/>sition, which it seems (page 199) is still alive at Rome :—
<lb/>"After all, this is not much worse than our own Inquisition
<lb/>of Public Opinion.” There has been too much nonsense ut-
<lb break="no"/>tered on this last subject. There is no country in the world,
<lb/>we believe, where there is less of this tyranny of public opi-
<lb break="no"/>nion than in the United States</p><p>The description of the Duomo of Milan will convey a very
fair impression of our writer’s style in description.
THE DUOMO OF MILAN.
</p><p>“ The only Rival or St. Peter’s is the Duomo or Milan ; and
<lb/>wonderful as is the former, I am so heretical as to find the latter far
<lb/>more beautiful and impressive. Imagine a white marble pyramid,
<lb/>miraculously sprouting, and shooting up from every part of its sur-
<lb break="no"/>face, spires, pinnacles and statues, and you will have a better idea of
<lb/>this most glorious Duomo, than by comparing it with any other
<lb/>Church. “ None but itself can be its parallel.” “ Facile Princeps.”
<lb/>The Cathedral of Cologne is indeed inspired by the same feeling, and
<lb/>is akin in some of its details, but it is only the bare single rose, while
<lb/>here in the more luxuriant soil and more balmy sky of Italy, the flow-
<lb break="no"/>er puts forth so many new leaves, and so doubles and re-duplicates its
<lb/>petals, that the luxuriant double rose of Milan can scarcely recognize
<lb/>its prototype in the single wild flower of Cologne.</p><p></p><p>“ This mountain of marble sends out on each side clustered buttres-
<lb break="no"/>ses connected with the main structure by flying arches, which spring
<lb/>through mid air, and form noble bridges, which are half invisible from
<lb/>below, and on which angels might not disdain to tread. From the front
<lb/>also, six buttresses project and rise above the sloping summit of the
<lb/>body of the Church. All these are filled with statues, each In a niche
<lb/>of its own, and from each buttress rise pinnacles on pinnacles, and
<lb/>spire branching from spire, each crowned with statues, so that the
<lb/>whole church is covered with a marble population of Saints and An-
<lb break="no"/>gels. The whole front is also embossed with sculptures in high re-
<lb break="no"/>lief, wherever the statues have left room ; and these pictures carved
<lb/>in stone record the various scenes and events of sacred history with
<lb/>more distinctness and expression than could any words. Between
<lb/>them are fantastic faces, smiling and frowning on you like mischievous
<lb/>sprites; and among other whims of the sculptor is a female head,
<lb/>covered with a marble veil, through which you seem to see features,
<lb/>which in reality have never been chiselled out, but only artfully sug-
<lb break="no"/>gested to the fancy. Days might be given to the study of all these
<lb/>devices, and at every visit much would be found both new and beauti-
<lb break="no"/>ful. The whole building is indeed u poem written in stone.</p><p>But great as is your admiration while you are below, you find when
</p><p>you mount to the roof, that you had not yet seen the tithe of its splen-
<lb break="no"/>dors. A winding staircase conducts you up, and you see that the same
<lb/>lavish and tasteful labor is given to the most secluded and seldom seen
<lb/>portions, as to the most conspicuous. The artists seem to have been
<lb/>deeply impressed with the feeling that nothing was too good for the
<lb/>service of the Divinity, to whom their labors were consecrated. The
<lb/>slabs which cover the roof, and on which you walk, are of fine marble.
<lb/>The backs of the statues, which can be seen only with particular
<lb/>pains, are found to be as highly finished as the fronts. The rich or-
<lb break="no"/>naments are in the most out-of-the-way corners, and everything shows
<lb/>that the workmen felt themselves engaged in a true labor of love.
<lb/>Every part of the roof seems perfectly alive with statues. Each of
<lb/>the spires and pinnacles, and each of their branches, bears a colossal
<lb/>statue. Among the rest is placed one by Canova, and the fact that
<lb/>it passes unnoticed among the rest, is a sufficient proof of the great
<lb/>merit of all. The inhabitants of this city of marble Saints are now
<lb/>nearly seven thousand in number, and when the designs are fully car-
<lb break="no"/>ried out, ten thousand marble statues, each different, and each of it-
<lb break="no"/>self a model, will people this noblest of Cathedrals. The readers of
<lb/>Wordsworth will remember his fine allusion, in his poem on " The
<lb/>Eclipse of the Sun on Lake Lugano,” to the darkness shading, as with
<lb/>sorrow, the faces of these Saints and Cherubs.”</p><p></p><p>The chapter entitled a Roman Dining House and Cafe, is
<lb/>one of the most interesting in the volume, both because it
<lb/>contains details which are new, having been plucked from
<lb/>the writer’s experience, and because, as he himself remarks,
<lb/>though every man may not be an Antiquarian, a Poet, or an
<lb/>Historian, yet we all agree in our reverence for a good din-
<lb break="no"/>ner.</p><p>The Fountains of Rome will attract the New-York read-
er’s attention.
</p><p>Every square in Rome—every public edifice—almost every pri-
<lb break="no"/>vate garden—is made cheerful and picturesque by the gush of water
<lb/>from Fountains decorated with sculpture and statuary. None are
<lb/>more graceful than the two in front of St. Peter’s (in which the jet
<lb/>falls into the vase, from the sides of which it streams in a circular
<lb/>sheet into a second vase, and from it again into a marble basin), but
<lb/>the others are so ingeniously varied in form and ornaments, that no
<lb/>two are alike, although I find forty-four engraved in “ a selection of
<lb/>the principal fountains of the renowned city of Rome,” published
<lb/>there in 1773. In one, a broad sheet of water pours down from a high
<lb/>aperture ; in another the nymph empties the stream from her pitcher;
<lb/>in a third, dolphins pour it from their mouths ; and in one of those
<lb/>which are always running from the walls for common use (the “ free
<lb/>hydrants” of Rome), the water flows from the bunghole of a marble
<lb/>cask which a marble porter is holding in his arms. In one Piazza the
<lb/>fountain is shaped like a boat, of which the main jet represents the
<lb/>mast; in another, four graceful youths support the basin on their
<lb/>heads ; and in a third, a Triton sits on a shell supported by four dol-
<lb break="no"/>phins, and holds over his head a conch, from which spouts up the wa-
<lb break="no"/>ter. The Piazza Savona contains three fountains, and in the principal
<lb/>one an Egyptian obelisk stands on a mass of rock, pierced with cav-
<lb break="no"/>erns on every side, and having chained it to four river gods, represent-
<lb break="no"/>ing the Danube, the Ganges, the Nile, and the Rio de la Plata ; so
<lb/>that the four quarters of the globe are thus made tributary to the Im-
<lb break="no"/>perial city. The Fontano Paulina rises like the front of a church on
<lb/>the Janiculum hill, overlooking all Rome, and three torrents rush</p><p><pb n="99"/>
</p><p>through its central arches, and fall into a large basin, from which they
<lb/>roll down the hill, turning mills and supplying reservoirs. Over the
<lb/>Fontana dell’ Acqua Felice rises an Ionic arcade, in the central niche
<lb/>of which stands Moses striking the rock at his feet, from which the
<lb/>water gushes out, and Aaron and Gideon figure in the basso-relievos on
<lb/>the other side. At the Quattro Fontane (known to our countrymen in
<lb/>Home as the location of the American Consulate), two broad streets
<lb/>cross each other at right angles, and when you stand at their intersec-
<lb break="no"/>tion your view is terminated in three directions by Egyptian obelisks,
<lb/>one on Monte Cavallo, a second at the Trinita de’ Monti, and a third
<lb/>before Santa Maria Maggiore. At each of the four corners of the
<lb/>streets the angles of the houses were cut away, and fountains are
<lb/>there constructed, with figures recumbent under sculptured trees, and
<lb/>other emblematic decorations.</p><p></p><p>“ But the Fountain of Trevi is the finest in all Rome, and therefore in
<lb/>all the world. In front of a palace adorned with Corinthian columns
<lb/>and pilasters, huge masses of rocks are piled up, so natural in shape
<lb/>and arrangement, that they seem to have been broken by an earth-
<lb break="no"/>quake, and then worn by the rush of water into their present forms.
<lb/>From every niche and crevice, to the right and to the left, upward
<lb/>and downward, gush out torrents of water, in the most copious varie-
<lb break="no"/>ty, and finally fall into a capacious white marble basin. In the midst
<lb/>of the rocks, and under a niche in the palace, a colossal statue of Nep-
<lb break="no"/>tune stands on a car, to which are harnessed two sea-horses, held by
<lb/>Tritons. The god of the Ocean majestically extends his right arm, as
<lb/>if about to rebuke the boiling waves with his famous "Quos ego—.”
<lb/>On each side of the niche which he occupies are statues of Salubrity
<lb/>and Abundance, with appropriate basso-relievos. All the necessaries
<lb/>thus combine to heighten the admiration of the visitor to the fountain
<lb/>of Trevi.</p><p></p><p>“ But should we be satisfied to admire, when we can emulate ? The
<lb/>rear of our New York City Hall offers an excellent site for a similar
<lb/>work. It is now an eyesore ; but we may make it an ornament to the
<lb/>city by arranging artistically before it, rough masses of rock (pleasant
<lb/>reminders, in the crowded city, of rural scenes), and pouring over
<lb/>them our Croton river, which should gush naturally from irregular
<lb/>openings as if it were just bursting up from its source. We may then
<lb/>employ our American sculptors to decorate the building in a style
<lb/>worthy of our future destinies, and in a grand central niche erect a
<lb/>statue, not of the false god, Neptune, but of the true man, Washing-
<lb break="no"/>ton ; and thus make this one of his long-desired Monuments.”</p><p></p><p>The rear of the City Hall is, indeed, an eye-sore, but we
<lb/>can suggest a better remedy for it than the construction of a
<lb/>fountain. The fountain needs a white back-ground for re-
<lb break="no"/>lief, to harmonize with the water—so the brown stone of the
<lb/>rear, economically contrived like the lining of a sailor's vest,
<lb/>would be only rendered more fatally conspicuous by the
<lb/>fountain. Let the City Hall be completed by the extension
<lb/>of wings and a new rear on Chambers street, preserving a
<lb/>court or quadrangle in the centre. The depth is now out of
<lb/>proportion with the width of the front. The order of archi-
<lb break="no"/>tecture, too, requires extent of surface to set it forth—a long
<lb/>succession of windows, arches, and colonnades. The City
<lb/>Hall, with this addition, would offer something to feed the
<lb/>eye along the line of Broadway. The only view, the front
<lb/>one, is now exclusively enjoyed by the cab-men, an attorney
<lb/>hastily crossing the walk to be in time for a motion, and the
<lb/>stationary fat cattle who are occasionally exhibited at the
<lb/>steps.</p><p></p><p>The typographical execution of the work, we should add,
<lb/>is distinguished for its beauty and accuracy—rare merits in
<lb/>these days of anti-copyright slovenliness.</p><p>Letters from a Landscape Painter.—By the author of Essays
for Summer Hours. Boston, James Munroe, It Co., 1845.
</p><p>There are many commendable things in this little volume,
<lb/>and many that are very far from being either commendable
<lb/>or excusable. The author has done himself an injury by
<lb/>substituting his profession in the place of his proper name.
<lb/>The letters of a Landscape Painter must provoke a critical
<lb/>examination of their merits as the production of an artist;
<lb/>and we have a right to expect in them fine descriptions of
<lb/>landscapes, and fine criticisms on art. But on these points
<lb/>Mr. Lanman, the author of the “ Letters,” is least capable.
<lb/>His remarks on painters are generally very inaccurate, or
<lb/>wholly unmeaning, and his descriptions of scenery are cold
<lb/>and colorless—they have neither outlines nor fillings up. He
<lb/>indulges continually in that style called by an English critic,
<lb/>the treble X. Every picture that he sees is the very best that
<lb/>he has ever seen, and moreover the best, as he verily be-</p><p></p><p>lieves, that anybody has ever seen. This is not the way in
<lb/>which men who have seen much usually express themselves;
<lb/>neither is it the manner of a cautious deliberate observer,
<lb/>who knows how ridiculously a critic appears who commits
<lb/>himself by giving a decided opinion upon a subject of which
<lb/>he is not himselfa master. Forinstance: after quoting some
<lb/>very common blank verses by Lewis L. Noble, Mr. Lanman
<lb/>asks, “ Can anything be more completely exquisite than the
<lb/>few lines that I have marked ? Is there anything in Dana
<lb/>Bryant, or Longfellow, that can eclipse them ? or in the very
<lb/>best of England’s modem poets ? There may be, but I have
<lb/>never been able to discern them, although I almost know bv
<lb/>heart the poetry of Wordsworth, Coleridge, Wilson, Cowper,
<lb/>Goldsmith, Beattie, Shelly, Scott, Rogers, Campbell, and
<lb/>Mrs. Hemans.” In speaking of Huntington, the painter, he
<lb/>says “ the shepherd boy of the Campagna, which we think
<lb/>is equal to Murillo’s beggar boy, was painted in the incredi-
<lb break="no"/>ble short period of four hours. If this fact and this picture
<lb/>do not prove Huntington to be a wonderful genius, we do not
<lb/>know what could do so.”</p><p></p><p>Neither do we. But still we do not think that the “ shep-
<lb break="no"/>herd boy” proves Mr. Huntington a genius. It bears no more
<lb/>resemblance to Murillo’s beggar boy than it does to the
<lb/>Logos of Leonardo da Vinci; and, we do not see what right
<lb/>Mr. Lanman has to institute a comparison between these</p><p></p><p>pictures, for we believe he has seen but one of them; and be-
<lb break="no"/>ing a painter himself he must know that any picture painted
<lb/>in four hours must be a daub, as the “ shepherd boy” is; and a
<lb/>very disagreeable one too. It is, probably, all that the paint-
<lb break="no"/>er meant to make it, a sketch, which he would hardly care
<lb/>to see exhibited as a test of his wonderful genius. In a lau-
<lb break="no"/>dation of Durand he describes one of his large landscapes
<lb/>and says “ the great triumph of this picture is in the water.”
<lb/>Nearly all who have seen the painting referred to, feel that its
<lb/>great defect is the water, which has a hard basaltic appear-
<lb break="no"/>ance, and is, in fact, inferior in this respect to all of his land-
<lb break="no"/>scapes. The remarks on Page and Inman are the purest rig-
<lb break="no"/>marole; although Mr. Lanman is hardly chargeable with
<lb/>their folly, since he does but echo the words of other writers
<lb/>more pretending than himself. Inferior artists find them-
<lb break="no"/>selves unequal to coping with nature, they leave out of their
<lb/>representations, therefore, the parts which they cannot imi-
<lb break="no"/>tate, and call their daubs an elevation of nature,—the grand
<lb/>style: they paint the most exaggerated and meaningless
<lb/>faces, and call them an intellectualisation: they give a cari-
<lb break="no"/>cature of humanity, and it is a representation of the soul.
<lb/>The errors afloat on this subject, which we have imbibed from
<lb/>the English, have spoilt many a good artist, and kept him in
<lb/>rags and poverty, when he might have earned reputation and
<lb/>wealth by following his instincts. Every man has a charac-
<lb break="no"/>ter of his own ; his spiritual being impresses itself upon his
<lb/>carcass, as it does in a great measure upon his clothes. We
<lb/>can distinguish any of our intimate friends by their gait,
<lb/>when walking, without seeing their faces; our very intimate
<lb/>friends we recognize by the manner of wearing their hats,
<lb/>or swinging their arms; or the tread of their feet. If, then,
<lb/>a man’s mind impresses itself upon his merely accidental ha-
<lb break="no"/>biliments, how much more does it give its own character to
<lb/>his face, which is always the companion of his soul, and
<lb/>whose flexibility is such that the slightest emotion of his spi-
<lb break="no"/>rit is moulded upon it. The only thing to be aimed at in
<lb/>giving a copy of a man’s face is truth ; any departure from
<lb/>the exact lineaments of a man’s countenance must cause a
<lb/>false impression of his character; to paint his forehead too
<lb/>high is as great a wrong to him as to paint it too low. Some
<lb/>artists give all their women red cheeks and scarlet lips,</p><p><pb n="100"/>
</p><p>and yet there is not one in a thousand that has either, the
<lb/>consequence is that women so misrepresented look as though
<lb/>they were rouged. A New York artist, now in Europe,
<lb/>once painted the portrait of a young lady for her lover, who
<lb/>said when he saw it that it gave him a disagreeable feeling,
<lb/>he could not tell why, but it reminded him of a courtesan.
<lb/>Somebody remarked to him that it was probably the color in
<lb/>the cheeks, and he exclaimed “ that’s it!” But this is what
<lb/>they call idealizing. Some painters give their portraits a
<lb/>smirking expression, which every body feels at the first
<lb/>glance is a lie, because no one could sit with a smiling face
<lb/>for a picture; and a smile is no more the natural look of any
<lb/>person than a frown. Inman’s portrait of Nicholas Biddle has
<lb/>this fault, and a very great one it is in such a man’s face.
<lb/>The only true expression of any one’s countenance is in per-
<lb break="no"/>fect repose. People lately deceased always look more fami-
<lb break="no"/>liar than when alive, excepting after a wasting disease, be-
<lb break="no"/>cause the features then settle into the habitual, not the acci-
<lb break="no"/>dental mould, which they have received from the mind. It
<lb/>is this state of perfect repose which gives the appearance of
<lb/>historical dignity to Vandyke’s portraits, and it is the want
<lb/>of it that gives to the portraits of Sir Thomas Lawrence, and
<lb/>the English school of portraiture, the character of affectation,
<lb/>which makes his lords and ladies look more like green-room
<lb/>heroes and heroines than real nobilities.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Lanman has carried his theory of ideal perfection to a
<lb/>very absurd excess in his present volume, as we will con-
<lb break="no"/>vince him ; we are not much acquainted with his works on
<lb/>canvass, but we have no doubt that he practices the same
<lb/>principles with his brush as with his pen. Perhaps a word
<lb/>of timely advice may open his eyes to his false theory, and
<lb/>lead him to do better hereafter. One of his letters is called
<lb/>a week in a fishing smack, and it professes to give six days’
<lb/>experience in a vessel of that description. Part of the time
<lb/>was spent in Nantucket, an out-of-the-way place, sufficiently
<lb/>quaint, and not requiring the smallest degree of idealizing to
<lb/>make any account of it tolerably interesting to a stranger.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Lanman goes “ strolling about the town,” as he says,
<lb/>“ studying the great and solemn drama of life while play-
<lb break="no"/>fully acting a subordinate part myself." What Mr. Lan-
<lb break="no"/>man saw in the town he does not tell us, nor how the great
<lb/>and solemn drama of life was performed in that remote part
<lb/>of the world. Perhaps the inhabitants were not aware who
<lb/>it was that was playfully acting a subordinate part among
<lb/>them. Playfully, if you please, Messieurs, only playfully,
<lb/>not really acting a subordinate part. Oh, no!</p><p></p><p>“ This morning, as it happened,” continues Mr. Lanman,
<lb/>“ I went into the public grave yard, (there are half a dozen
<lb/>public grave-yards in Nantucket,) and spent an hour in con-
<lb break="no"/>ning over the rude inscriptions to the memory of the departed,
<lb/>(to whose memory should they have been made, but to the
<lb/>departed ?) In that city of the dead, I saw a number of the
<lb/>living walking to and fro, but there was one who attracted
<lb/>my particular attention. He was a seaman of noble presence,
<lb/>seated upon an unmarked mound, with his feet resting upon
<lb/>a smaller one beside it, his head reclined upon one hand,
<lb/>while the other was occasionally passed across his face, as
<lb/>if wiping away a tear. I hailed him with a few kind ques-
<lb break="no"/>tions, (rather, obtrusive, we think,) and my answer was the
<lb/>following brief tale. ‘Yes, sir, four years ago I shipped
<lb/>aboard that whaler yonder, (all the grave-yards in Nantucket
<lb/>are so situated that no whaler can be seen from either of
<lb/>them,) leaving behind me in a sweet little cottage of my own,
<lb/>a dear, first-rate mother, a good wife, and an only boy. They
<lb/>were all in the enjoyment of good health, and happy ; and
<lb/>when we were under sail, and I saw from the mast head,</p><p></p><p>how kindly they waved their handkerchiefs beside my door,
<lb/>(there is not a house on the island so situated that such a
<lb/>performance could be witnessed from the mast-head of a ship
<lb/>under a sail,) I too was happy, even in my hour of grief.
<lb/>Since that time, I have circumnavigated the globe, and every
<lb/>rare curiosity I could obtain, was intended for my darling
<lb/>ones at home. Last Saturday our ship returned. And while
<lb/>yet a league from port, I was again at the mast-head, look-
<lb break="no"/>ing with an anxious heart towards my nest on the shore.
<lb/>(Two leagues from port there happens to be a sand-bar,
<lb/>which prevents a ship from approaching nearer until her car-
<lb break="no"/>go is discharged into lighters, which generally occupies eight
<lb/>or ten days: and the only “ nests” upon the shore are those
<lb/>that the gulls build in the cliff.) I saw that the blinds were
<lb/>closed, and that all around was very still; but they were
<lb/>only gone a visiting, thought I, and rejoiced at heart. (He
<lb/>had no need to think about the matter at all, for the pilot must
<lb/>have been on board some hours, and he had only to inquire
<lb/>after his wife and family, to hear all the particulars.) I landed,
<lb/>flew to my dwelling, and found it locked. (The first man he
<lb/>met would have told him that his house was shut up, and
<lb/>recommended him to go to one of his uncles or cousins, and
<lb/>saved him from flying to his cottage.) The flagging in my
<lb/>yard attracted my notice, and I thought it strange that the
<lb/>rank grass had been suffered to grow over it so thickly. The
<lb/>old minister passed by my gate, and running to him with
<lb/>extended hand, I inquired for my family. ‘ Oh, Mr. B.,’ said
<lb/>he, ‘you must bless the Lord, he gave them to you, and he
<lb/>hath taken them away.’ And as the thought stole into my
<lb/>brain, my suffering, sir, was intense, and I longed to die. And
<lb/>there they are, my wife and darling child, and a step or two
<lb/>beyond, my dear old mother. Peace to their memories. As
<lb/>for me, I am a victim to blight and desolation, and that sa-
<lb break="no"/>cred song, which my mother used to be so fond of singing on
<lb/>Sabbath evenings long ago; that song I can understand now:</p><p>' I would not live alway ; I ask not to stay
Where storm after storm rises dark o’er the way ;
The few lurid mornings that dawn on us here,
Are enough for life’s woes, full enough for its cheer.’
</p><p>(This Song was written by Bishop Onderdonk of Pennsylva-
<lb break="no"/>nia, and we are inclined to think that the seaman with a
<lb/>noble presence who was a victim to blight and desolation,
<lb/>was mistaken in thinking that he had heard his “ first-rate
<lb/>mother” sing it long ago. It was probably some other
<lb/>song, or some other person. So, too, we think there must be
<lb/>some mistake about the old minister, as all the ministers in
<lb/>Nantucket for the last ten years have been quite young men.)
<lb/>In a few days I mean to deliver up my property to the sea-
<lb break="no"/>man’s Friend Society, and then launching upon the deep
<lb/>once more, become, and forever, a wanderer from my native
<lb/>land. Such is the simple story I heard in the Nantucket
<lb/>grave-yard, and I have pondered much upon the world of
<lb/>woe which must be hidden in the breast of that old mariner.
<lb/>May the tale not have been recorded in vain !”</p><p></p><p>We join in this last aspiration very heartily. May it not.
<lb/>Of course no such tale was ever told to Mr. Lanman, and of
<lb/>course he never “ pondered much” about it, or he would not
<lb/>have written it. It is not only physically, but morally im-
<lb break="no"/>possible. But it is exactly in accordance with Mr. Lanman's
<lb/>principles in art, and precisely the kind of writing which we
<lb/>should expect from a man who could pen such dreadful non-
<lb break="no"/>sense as this: “ Painting as he does, with great rapidity, we
<lb/>find that his (Inman’s) drawing is seldom as correct as it
<lb/>should be. He manifests a refined and exalted taste in the ar-
<lb break="no"/>rangement of his portraits, and generally in his miscellaneous
<lb/>designs. But, after all, he has painted some poor pictures.</p><p><pb n="101"/>
</p><p>and this is an evidence of the fact, that he is a man of un-
<lb break="no"/>common genius, and not talent. There is a wonderful spirit
<lb/>in his heads, and, unlike his rival, Page, he portrays the
<lb/>mind, which, after all, is a greater triumph of art, and far
<lb/>more important in a portrait, than the mere shell of human-
<lb break="no"/>ity as delineated by Page.”</p><p></p><p>The first letter in the collection is the best, it has the most
<lb/>unequivocal marks of being honestly written, and introduces
<lb/>us to a scene which needed none of the embellishments of
<lb/>fancy. Peter Hummel, the vagabond bark-gatherer, is very
<lb/>happily sketched, and evidently from nature ; the draughts
<lb/>of fishes appear almost miraculous, but we do not pretend to
<lb/>question their truth. The letter from Burlington is also in
<lb/>good taste, inasmuch as it treats of facts, and gives us scraps
<lb/>of information which we do not find floating in the current of
<lb/>daily news. There is almost too great a disposition to glo-
<lb break="no"/>rify the gentlemen whose names are mentioned, but as noth-
<lb break="no"/>ing but good, and what is true is said of them, of course
<lb/>nobody will take offence. Mr. Peck may not be ambitious
<lb/>of distinction, as a “giver of glorious dinners,” and probably
<lb/>he will be as much surprised as any of his friends to see
<lb/>himself compared to Roscoe, whom Mr. Lanman evidently
<lb/>knows nothing about, except what he gathered from the
<lb/>Sketch-Book, or he would not call him a merchant of the
<lb/>first-rank. If any gentleman in Burlington can be compared
<lb/>with Roscoe, it is Mr. Marsh, who does, in fact, occupy a
<lb/>position very similar to that which Roscoe filled in Liver-
<lb break="no"/>pool, being a lawyer, a legislator, a lecturer, an author, an
<lb/>amateur in art, and the possessor of the best collection of
<lb/>books in the place.</p><p></p><p>One of the unpleasant things about Mr. Lanman's book
<lb/>is its didacticism; he seems to labor under an impression
<lb/>that he is especially called upon to extract a solemn reflec-
<lb break="no"/>tion out of every incident, and to find a sermon in every
<lb/>stone that he stumbles upon. But sermons and solemn re-
<lb break="no"/>flections are just the things that the world can best afford to
<lb/>do without at the present day. It is preeminently an enqui-
<lb break="no"/>ring age; nothing is so much needed as facts; mankind are
<lb/>beginning to perceive that nothing finds its way to the heart
<lb/>so readily as a truth, and if those who have an opportunity
<lb/>to go about, and a desire to make a book, would honestly set
<lb/>down a plain account of what they see, rather than what
<lb/>they think, the fruit of their labors would be much better
<lb/>received by the world.</p><p></p><p>We would recommend Mr. Bryant’s letters from the South
<lb/>as a model for all young travellers who have a design of
<lb/>publishing a book, or else the Irish Sketch-Book of Mr. Mi-
<lb break="no"/>chael Angelo Titmarsh ; but the first will be found a safer
<lb/>model, for the style of Mr. Titmarsh is altogether inimita-
<lb break="no"/>ble, and his humor not a thing to be thought of by any one
<lb/>besides himself.</p><p></p><p>The most commendable thing in the Letters of a Landscape
<lb/>Painter, is the excellence of their aim. The author models
<lb/>himself after the best masters to be found, and his presump-
<lb break="no"/>tions arc evidence that he feels himself capable of doing
<lb/>something. He goes a-trouting, like Izaak Walton, and
<lb/>,akes nothing of sleeping in the open air, with a vagabond
<lb/>hunter for his companion; he foots it across mountains with
<lb/>a rifle on his back with the spirit of Kit North ; he goes out
<lb/>in a fishing smack to Nantucket, as Walter Scott went to
<lb/>the Hebrides, and wherever he stops, he contrives to fall into
<lb/>good rather than flashy company. All these signs are favor-
<lb break="no"/>able for a young amateur, and did we not dislike affectation
<lb/>of all kinds, and affectations of piety the most of all, we
<lb/>Would not give it as our opinion that he says his prayers too
<lb/>often; or rather that he says he says them. There are some</p><p></p><p>things which a man might as well keep to himself, and the
<lb/>frequency with which he says his prayers is the chief of
<lb/>them. It is an act so purely personal, that we see no neces-
<lb break="no"/>sity for trumpeting it, and the command of our Savior is so
<lb/>explicit in respect of that act which no Christian is supposed
<lb/>to neglect, that we do not see why it should be so often dis-
<lb break="no"/>regarded.</p><p></p><p>We understand that Mr. Lanman is quite a young man,
<lb/>and that he has abandoned both painting and writing for
<lb/>trade; of course he knows best himself, whether he acts
<lb/>wisely in so doing. He will probably not make a worse
<lb/>merchant for having painted pictures and published books.
<lb/>Men of his age have done much worse things than either,
<lb/>and succeeded well in business after all. It is not likely
<lb/>that this will be the last time that we shall hear from him,
<lb/>but when he comes out again it will be in a better shape than
<lb/>he appears in now. Young authors, like other young men,
<lb/>have their wild oats to sow, and the sooner they get rid of
<lb/>them the better, and the ranker the crop the greater the
<lb/>hope of improvement.</p><p>PLACES WORTH VISITING.
MONSIEUR EDOUART’S SILHOUETTE ROOMS.
BY MRS. L. M. CHILD.
</p><p>Among the places worth visiting, you might have enume-
<lb break="no"/>rated the room of Monsieur Edouart, No. 285 Broadway. At
<lb/>the first glance, his gallery has a singular effect on the eye.
<lb/>It reminded me of the democratic procession, by torchlight,
<lb/>where horses, men, and temples of liberty, in the intense
<lb/>brilliancy of Drummond lights, went stalking by as black
<lb/>shadows on the opposite walls.</p><p></p><p>Of these silhouette likenesses, he has some fifty thousand
<lb/>Americans, and three times that number of Europeans. On
<lb/>examination, one is struck with the wonderful expression
<lb/>imparted to these cuttings; the life-like delineation of the
<lb/>various passions. The first feeling is that of regret, that such
<lb/>an eye for form, such a decided love of art, should not have
<lb/>been employed on the more beautiful and enduring material
<lb/>of marble. It would have been so, had not the artist’s father
<lb/>made the common mistake, of insisting that his son should
<lb/>not walk in the path for which nature had designed him.
<lb/>Belonging to the genteel classes, he naturally considered
<lb/>military distinction more honorable than artistic fame. So
<lb/>modelling and drawing were forbidden, and all his seven
<lb/>sons became officers in Bonaparte’s army. One only survived
<lb/>his numerous campaigns; and he escaped through more
<lb/>perils than a truly brave man ever likes to boast of to the</p><p>public.
</p><p>Like most Frenchmen, M. Edouart is an enthusiastic ad-
<lb break="no"/>mirer of Napoleon. He shakes his head mournfully, when-
<lb break="no"/>ever he alludes to his downfall. On such occasions, I never
<lb/>intrude my peace principles upon him ; not considering the
<lb/>soil very favorable to such a growth. Nor do I jar upon his
<lb/>proud recollections of military success and national renown,
<lb/>by telling him with what peculiar satisfaction I always listen
<lb/>to the words in the Lament for Bonaparte, “ He has fought
<lb/>his last battle. No sound shall awake him to glory again.”
<lb/>The remains of his armies belong to the moral sentiment of
<lb/>a warlike past. I trust they were the final efflorescence of
<lb/>the “ might gives right” principle.</p><p></p><p>But from the turbulent scenes of war, M. Edouart has
<lb/>brought some pleasant and refreshing recollections. While
<lb/>one of the commissioners of the army, he was distinguished
<lb/>for his moderation and forbearance toward those from whom
<lb/>be was ordered to raise forced supplies of provisions for the</p><p><pb n="102"/>
</p><p>army. Unlike most others in the same office, he never abu-
<lb break="no"/>sed his power to fill his own purse. He took only such arti-
<lb break="no"/>cles as were absolutely necessary, and for these he was care-
<lb break="no"/>ful to give receipts, the value of which were allowed by the
<lb/>government to the people, when the expenses of the war
<lb/>were paid by general taxation. The honesty and kindness
<lb/>thus manifested, were so highly appreciated by the emperor
<lb/>Francis II., that he presented M. Edouart with a magnificent
<lb/>gold box, with a hundred diamonds round the edge of the
<lb/>cover, four large and brilliant diamonds in the corners, and
<lb/>the letter F closely set in diamonds in the centre.</p><p></p><p>The cutting of silhouette likenesses was at first merely taken
<lb/>up for amusement, to relieve the loneliness caused by the
<lb/>death of his wife, to whom he was strongly attached. His
<lb/>early love of Art returned upon him, till this employment
<lb/>became an absorbing passion. The common prejudice
<lb/>against profile-cutting, as a merely mechanical process, an-
<lb break="no"/>noyed him considerably. But people soon became aware that
<lb/>there was a life and expression about his cuttings, which
<lb/>raised them altogether above mere mechanical accuracy, and
<lb/>rendered them worthy to be dignified with the name of Art.
<lb/>In the gallery, at his room, the two men playing at chess, the
<lb/>husband and wife quarrelling, and John’s funny story to the
<lb/>cook, are remarkable instances of an almost speaking ex-
<lb break="no"/>pression conveyed in mere outline.</p><p></p><p>M. Edouart obtained great popularity in England and
<lb/>Scotland, and has a very curious profile collection of the dis-
<lb break="no"/>tinguished men and women, whose likenesses he took there.
<lb/>There is Sir Walter Scott, in his room at Abbotsford; and
<lb/>Hannah More in her study at Barley Wood, with a likeness
<lb/>of her table, and the favorite silver inkstand, from which she
<lb/>wrote all her works. He speaks with much pleasure of his
<lb/>visit to the good old lady, who was then eighty-four years
<lb/>old. She gave him a small cake that had been sent her,
<lb/>saying that she never ate anything with shortening in it, and
<lb/>never drank anything but water. A field of grain was wav-
<lb break="no"/>ing before the open window; pointing to it with a smile, she
<lb/>said, in tones of youthful enthusiasm, “ Look, Monsieur Ed-
<lb break="no"/>ouart, look on that golden sea.”</p><p></p><p>Charles X. and his court were at Edinburgh, while he was
<lb/>there. He took all their likenesses, and the exiled monarch
<lb/>was so much pleased with them, that he presented him with
<lb/>a valuable diamond ring. The likeness of the king was cut
<lb/>on paper folded in two, and one of the duplicates was after-
<lb break="no"/>wards carefully corrected. By some accident, this fell upon
<lb/>the floor, and M. Edouart, seeing it, exclaimed, “Ah, viola un
<lb/>roi tombe ; et encore celui gui este corige." (Ah, see a king
<lb/>has fallen ; and the one that was corrected too.) The de-
<lb break="no"/>throned monarch, with a sad smile, replied emphatically,</p><p></p><p>“ Un roi tombe, et corrige en vente." (A king fallen, and
<lb/>corrected indeed). The artist, of course, felt somewhat em-
<lb break="no"/>barrassed at having made a thoughtless exclamation, which
<lb/>brought up such unpleasant reminiscences; particularly as
<lb/>be himself was well known to have been one of Bonaparte’s
<lb/>officers. But the unfortunate royal family were all polite
<lb/>enough to take it very good naturedly.</p><p></p><p>While in Edinburgh, the attention of George Combe, the
<lb/>celebrated phrenologist and physiologist, was attracted by
<lb/>M. Edouart’s head, which bears a very striking resemblance
<lb/>to the busts of Socrates. He was very desirous to have a
<lb/>cast of it taken in plaster; but this request was refused, from
<lb/>a fear that the wet lime might possibly do some injury to his
<lb/>eyes. To evade Mr. Combe’s opportunities, he often play-
<lb break="no"/>fully replied, “Wait till I am dead—wait till I am dead ; and
<lb/>then I promise you that you shall have my skull.”</p><p>This led toa funny adventure. Not long after, M. Edouart
was taken ill at Glasgow, and it was supposed that he would
</p><p>die of an internal tumor. Being a foreigner, his friends
<lb/>thought it necessary to inquire whether he had any particu-
<lb break="no"/>lar directions to give concerning his burial. “ Yes,” said he,
<lb/>“I wish you to have a strong box made, pack me in it, and
<lb/>write on the outside, ‘To the University of Edinburgh, with
<lb/>Monsieur Edouart’s compliments.’ ” The physician remon-
<lb break="no"/>strated in vain. His friends gathered round his bedside, and
<lb/>earnestly represented how very unpleasant it would be to his
<lb/>sons, should they at any future time visit the University, and
<lb/>have their father’s bones pointed out to them. Still he per-
<lb break="no"/>sisted that his body should be sent to Edinburgh, with Mon-
<lb break="no"/>sieur Edouart’s compliments. But notwithstanding this phi-
<lb break="no"/>losophic coolness, the continued expostulations, acting on
<lb/>nerves weakened by illness, did make an unpleasant im-
<lb break="no"/>pression. The doctor proposed to apply some leeches, one
<lb/>day; but previous to this operation, the patient had taken
<lb/>opium freely, to allay violent internal pain. The mental
<lb/>hallucination produced thereby, took its coloring partly from
<lb/>recent conversations. There was ever in his brain a whirl-
<lb break="no"/>ing vision of dissecting knives, skulls and skeletons. In
<lb/>the midst of this fantasy, he fell asleep. When he awoke,
<lb/>the room was very light, and full of people. Two or three
<lb/>doctors stood near him, and kneeling across his body was a
<lb/>man with his shirt sleeves rolled up, and his hands covered
<lb/>with blood. With a loud shriek, and eyes almost starting
<lb/>from their sockets, the dying man sprung up, plunged forward
<lb/>with desperate strength, and yelling, “ I’m not dead yet!”
<lb/>he pitched the man over the foot of the bed, and sent him
<lb/>with his bowl of blood and leeches, rolling over the floor.
<lb/>This violent exertion, which he could have made only under
<lb/>the stimulus of intense terror, saved his life. The inward
<lb/>tumor broke, and he once more breathed freely. It is a favo-
<lb break="no"/>rite story of his; and he usually begins with the question,
<lb/>“ Did I ever tell you how I saved my life by giving my body
<lb/>for dissection ?’’ But to enjoy it fully, one should hear him
<lb/>tell it in his own animated and dramatic style, with his lively
<lb/>French gestures. He has been in all parts of the world, and
<lb/>seen all sorts of people, and it is as good as a well acted
<lb/>comedy, to hear him tell his adventures.</p><p></p><p>The introduction of daguerreotype injures his business as it
<lb/>does miniatures and pencilled likenesses. But a Frenchman
<lb/>is like a cat, who always falls on her feet, throw her as you
<lb/>will. Instead of grumbling about modern inventions, he very
<lb/>philosophicaily began to take daguerreotypes himself; and
<lb/>whatever he undertakes, he never rests till he does it in the
<lb/>most perfect manner. At his room people can have their
<lb/>choice between daguerreotypes and silhouettes. Among the
<lb/>variety of curious workmanship there, are several animals
<lb/>covered with their own hair, which are remarkably full of
<lb/>life and expression. Altogether, it is a very agreeable place
<lb/>to look into.	l. m. c.</p><p>THE NEW YORK GALLERY OF THE FINE ARTS
</p><p>This is not a free exhibition, as it should be to render much
<lb/>service to the community ; but it is next door to one. The
<lb/>price of life membership is but one dollar, which will entitle
<lb/>the subscriber to a free admission forever. Single admissions
<lb/>are twenty-five cents, which is too high in proportion. We
<lb/>have not the least doubt that if the price of admission were re-
<lb break="no"/>duced to sixpence, the number of visitors would be increased
<lb/>more than four fold. The object in establishing a Gallery of
<lb/>Art being the good of the people, every inducement that can
<lb/>possibly be held out to them to make it a place of resort,
<lb/>should be adopted. The rich and well educated stand in lit-
<lb break="no"/>tle need of any such aids to refinement, but to the poor and
<lb/>ignorant, a public gallery of pictures is a real blessing, and
<lb/>it is for their aid that such places are, or should be es</p><p><pb n="103"/>
</p><p>tablished. A picture need not be didactic like the picture-
<lb break="no"/>stories of Hogarth, to do good. Nature affixes no morals to any
<lb/>of her productions, yet her perfections and beauty impress
<lb/>the heart more sensibly than the wisdom of Solomon. Go to
<lb/>the ant, thou sluggard, and behold the lilies of the valley,
<lb/>are important directions which the artist should ever bear in
<lb/>mind, and aim in his works to imitate nature in representing
<lb/>a perfect and beautiful object without giving himself any trou-
<lb break="no"/>ble about the point or moral of it. If every field flow-
<lb break="no"/>er had its medicinal qualities inscribed upon its petals, we
<lb/>should take as little pleasure in wandering through the fields
<lb/>as in going into an apothecary’s shop. Whatever is beauti-
<lb break="no"/>ful speaks audibly enough to the heart and the understanding;
<lb/>all that we want is somebody to make us feel its beauty; the
<lb/>moral of it will come out of itself. Perhaps these remarks
<lb/>will prepare the way for us to say, that we dislike exceeding-
<lb break="no"/>ly Cole’s allegorical landscapes in the New York Gallery.
<lb/>The pictures in themselves are truly beautiful, but the plan
<lb/>of them is against nature. Their beauty is marred by being
<lb/>seen together. We perceive directly that we are imposed
<lb/>upon. Instead of looking upon beautiful landscapes, we dis-
<lb break="no"/>cern that they are sermons in green paint; essays in gilt
<lb/>frames. The charm of nature is destroyed, the moment that
<lb/>the discovery is made; and we turn from them in disgust,
<lb/>without knowing the cause of it.</p><p></p><p>But this is not the only defect of these pictures ; they are
<lb/>landscapes, and nothing else, while they affect a moral cha-
<lb break="no"/>racter which landscapes can never have. The men in them
<lb/>are not seen at all when they are viewed at a proper distance,
<lb/>and if seen they are subordinates, not principals, as they
<lb/>should be, in a performance which professes to point a mor-
<lb break="no"/>al. The first of the series represents a wild scene of green
<lb/>trees and so forth ; meant to typify the beginning of empire ;
<lb/>the sun is just rising from the sea, which symbolises the
<lb/>mind rising from the darkness of ignorance; a mass of heavy
<lb/>paint which obscures a good part of the canvass represents
<lb/>the mists of error fleeing before the rising sun of intelligence.
<lb/>This first picture has the least artistic merit of the series, and
<lb/>at once lets us into the secret of the allegory, and destroys all
<lb/>the pleasure that the others would give if looked upon as
<lb/>mere pictures. There can be nothing better than nature.
<lb/>Man cannot be wiser than God. It is idle, then, to think of
<lb/>improving on his manner of teaching. No landscape can
<lb/>ever teach a profitable lesson, when nature is caricatured or
<lb/>exaggerated. Her simplicity is the divinest wisdom. Let
<lb/>any one test the truth of our principle by looking at this
<lb/>“ savage state" painting, and then turning to the little piece
<lb/>by the same artist at the opposite end of the gallery, number-
<lb break="no"/>ed 65, and interpreting honestly the effect which each has up-
<lb break="no"/>on his feelings. This last picture is one of Mr. Cole’s ear-
<lb break="no"/>lier works, painted when he seemed to love nature more than
<lb/>newspaper applause, or bank notes; it has more real merit
<lb/>than all of his allegorical pictures together; the pure morning
<lb/>sky, the still lake, the cool shadows of the dark woods, the
<lb/>feeling of nature over all, are unsurpassed by any landscape
<lb/>that has been painted in this country. A sensation of coun-
<lb break="no"/>try air lingers in our memory for a whole day after seeing
<lb/>it; and we cannot but think that many of the subjects in Mr.
<lb/>Willis’ Japonica-dom, would be tempted into habits of early
<lb/>rising by seeing in this little picture how lovely the morning
<lb/>sky looks a half hour before sunrise.</p><p></p><p>The last picture of the five, by Mr. Cole, representing the
<lb/>Course of Empire, is worth all the others of the series. It
<lb/>should, indeed, be exhibited by itself, without any hint being
<lb/>given of its allegorical character, that it might be enjoyed
<lb/>without any uncomfortable feeling of its didacticism.</p><p></p><p>There is another bit of Nature in the gallery, of a character
<lb/>entirely different from the Nature which Mr. Cole loves to
<lb/>depict; the “ Truant Gamblers,” by Mount. It is one of his
<lb/>best pictures; probably the very best. The color is better
<lb/>than in many of his paintings, but the expression is unap-
<lb break="no"/>proachable. The surly farmer with the switch in his hand,
<lb/>and a world of ill-nature, which mankind have agreed to dig-
<lb break="no"/>nify with the name of prudent industry, concentrated in his
<lb/>features, will bear a comparison with the finest things in
<lb/>Hogarth. The contrast between the happy abandonment of
<lb/>the boys, whose whole souls are given up to their game, and
<lb/>the small ferocity of the farmer, who will have nobody at
<lb/>play, because he is at work, is a happy stroke of genius. If
<lb/>the gallery contained no other picture than this, it would still
<lb/>be one of the places best worth visiting in New York.</p><p>SOME SECRETS OF THE MAGAZINE PRISON-HOUSE,
</p><p>The want of an International Copy-Right Law, by rendering
<lb/>it nearly impossible to obtain anything from the booksellers
<lb/>in the way of remuneration for literary labor, has had the ef-
<lb break="no"/>fect of forcing many of our very best writers into the service
<lb/>of the Magazines and Reviews, which with a pertinacity
<lb/>that does them credit, keep up in a certain or uncertain de-
<lb break="no"/>gree the good old saying, that even in the thankless field of
<lb/>Letters the laborer is worthy of his hire. How—by dint of
<lb/>what dogged instinct of the honest and proper, these journals
<lb/>have contrived to persist in their paying practices, in the
<lb/>very teeth of the opposition got up by the Fosters and Leo-
<lb break="no"/>nard Scotts, who furnish for eight dollars any four of the Brit-
<lb break="no"/>ish periodicals for a year, is a point we have bad much diffi-
<lb break="no"/>culty in settling to our satisfaction, and we have been forced to
<lb/>settle it, at last, upon no more reasonable ground than that
<lb/>of a still lingering esprit de patrie. That Magazines can
<lb/>live, and not only live but thrive, and not only thrive but
<lb/>afford to disburse money for original contributions, are facts
<lb/>which can only be solved, under the circumstances, by the
<lb/>really fanciful but still agreeable supposition, that there is
<lb/>somewhere still existing an ember not altogether quenched
<lb/>among the fires of good feeling for letters and literary men,
<lb/>that once animated the American bosom.</p><p></p><p>It would not do (perhaps this is the idea) to let our poor de-
<lb break="no"/>vil authors absolutely starve, while we grow fat, in a litera-
<lb break="no"/>ry sense, on the good things of which we unblushingly pick
<lb/>the pocket of all Europe: it would not be exactly the thing
<lb/>comme il faut, to permit a positive atrocity of this kind: and
<lb/>hence we have Magazines, and hence we have a portion of
<lb/>the public who subscribe to these Magazines (through sheer
<lb/>pity), and hence we have Magazine publishers (who some-
<lb break="no"/>times take upon themselves the duplicate title of “editor and
<lb/>proprietor,”)—publishers, we say, who, under certain condi-
<lb break="no"/>tions of good conduct, occasional puffs, and decent subservi-
<lb break="no"/>ency at all times, make it a point of conscience to encourage
<lb/>the poor devil author with a dollar or two, more or less as he
<lb/>behaves himself properly and abstains from the indecent ha-
<lb break="no"/>bit of turning up his nose.</p><p></p><p>We hope, however, that we are not so prejudiced or so vin-
<lb break="no"/>dictive as to insinuate that what certainly does look like illi-
<lb break="no"/>berality on the part of them (the Magazine publishers) is
<lb/>really an illiberality chargeable to them. In fact, it will be
<lb/>seen at once, that what we have said has a tendency directly
<lb/>the reverse of any such accusation. These publishers pay
<lb/>something—other publishers nothing at all. Here certainly is
<lb/>a difference—although a mathematician might contend that
<lb/>the difference might be infinitesimally small. Still, these
<lb/>Magazine editors and proprietors pay (that is the word), and</p><p><pb n="104"/>
</p><p>with your true poor-devil author the smallest favors are sure
<lb/>to be thankfully received. No: the illiberality lies at the
<lb/>door of the demagogue-ridden public, who suffer their anoint-
<lb break="no"/>ed delegates (or perhaps arointed—which is it ?) to insult the
<lb/>common sense of them (the public) by making orations in our
<lb/>national halls on the beauty and conveniency of robbing the
<lb/>Literary Europe on the highway, and on the gross absurdity
<lb/>in especial of admitting so unprincipled a principle, that a
<lb/>man has any right and title either to his own brains or the
<lb/>flimsy material that he chooses to spin out of them, like a con-
<lb break="no"/>founded caterpillar as he is. If anything of this gossamer
<lb/>character stands in need of protection, why we have our hands
<lb/>full at once with the silk-worms and the morus multicaulis.</p><p></p><p>But if we cannot, under the circumstances, complain of the
<lb/>absolute illiberality of the Magazine publishers (since pay
<lb/>they do), there is at least one particular in which we have
<lb/>against them good grounds of accusation. Why (since pay
<lb/>they must) do they not pay with a good grace, and promptly.
<lb/>Were we in an ill humor at this moment, we could a tale un-
<lb break="no"/>fold which would erect the hair on the head of Shylock. A
<lb/>young author, struggling with Despair itself in the shape of a
<lb/>ghastly poverty, which has no alleviation—no sympathy from
<lb/>an every-day world, that cannot understand his necessities,
<lb/>and that would pretend not to understand them if it com-
<lb break="no"/>prehended them ever so well—this young author is politely
<lb/>requested to compose an article, for which he will “ be hand-
<lb break="no"/>somely paid.” Enraptured, he neglects perhaps for a month
<lb/>the sole employment which affords him the chance of a live-
<lb break="no"/>lihood, and having starved through the month (he and his
<lb/>family) completes at length the month of starvation and the
<lb/>article, and despatches the latter (with a broad hint about
<lb/>the former) to the pursy “ editor” and bottle-nosed “proprie-
<lb break="no"/>tor” who has condescended to honor him (the poor devil) with
<lb/>his patronage. A month (starving still), and no reply. Ano-
<lb break="no"/>ther month—still none. Two months more—still none. A
<lb/>second letter, modestly hinting that the article may not have
<lb/>reached its destination—still no reply. At the expiration of
<lb/>six additional months, personal application is made at the
<lb/>“ editor and proprietor” ’s office. Call again. The poor devil
<lb/>goes out, and does not fail to call again. Still call again;—and
<lb/>call again is the word for three or four months more. His
<lb/>patience exhausted, the article is demanded. No—he can’t
<lb/>have it—(the truth is, it was too good to be given up so ea-
<lb break="no"/>sily)—“it is in print,” and “contributions of this character
<lb/>are never paid for (it is a rule we have) under six months af-
<lb break="no"/>ter publication. Call in six months after the issue of your
<lb/>affair, and your money is ready for you—for we are business
<lb/>men, ourselves—prompt.” With this the poor devil is satis-
<lb break="no"/>fied, and makes up his mind that the “ editor and proprietor"
<lb/>is a gentleman, and that of course he (the poor devil) will
<lb/>wait as requested. And it is supposable that he would have
<lb/>waited if he could—but Death in the meantime would not.
<lb/>He dies, and by the good luck of his decease (which came by
<lb/>starvation) the fat “ editor and proprietor” is fatter hencefor-
<lb break="no"/>ward and for ever to the amount of five and twenty dollars,
<lb/>very cleverly saved, to be spent generously in canvas-backs
<lb/>and champagne.</p><p></p><p>There are two things which we hope the reader will not
<lb/>do, as he runs over this article: first, we hope that he will
<lb/>not believe that we write from any personal experience of
<lb/>our own, for we have only the reports of actual sufferers to
<lb/>depend upon, and second, that he will not make any personal
<lb/>application of our remarks to any Magazine publisher now
<lb/>living, it being well known that they are all as remarkable
<lb/>for their generosity and urbanity, as for their intelligence, and
<lb/>appreciation of Genius.</p><p>Original Poetry.

A FRAGMENT.
Thick rushing, like an ocean vast
Of bisons the fair prairies shaking,
</p><p>The notes crowd heavily and fast
<lb/>As surfs, one plunging while the last
<lb/>Draws seaward from its foamy breaking.</p><p>Or in low murmurs they began,
Rising and rising momently,
</p><p>As, o’er a harp Ӕolian
<lb/>A fitful breeze, until they ran
<lb/>Up to a sudden ecstacy.</p><p>And then, like minute-drops of rain
Ringing in water silverly,
They lingering dropt and dropt again,
Till it was almost like a pain
To listen when the next would be.

THE REVELATION.
BY B. H.
Twilight over earth was stealing,
And my spirit’s wing was furl’d,
Musing on a dim revealing,
Of a purer, brighter world.
The old book I had been reading,
Brimfull was of holy thought,
Far away through darkness leading,
With a mystic meaning fraught.
</p><p>Truth it seemed yet changing ever,
<lb/>Seeking what that truth might be;
<lb/>Long I strove with vain endeavor,</p><p>To unveil its mystery.
Sitting by the open casement,
</p><p>With the old book in my hand,
<lb/>Outward looking—with amazement,
<lb/>There I saw a figure stand,</p><p>Shadowy it was and glimmered,
Like a billow’s snowy crest,
And the moonlight through it shimmered.
With a beautiful un-rest.
Like a shining one descending,
</p><p>Struggling in the wind’s embrace,
<lb/>Seemed she now—now dimly blending;
<lb/>With the shadows in their race.</p><p>Bending with a waving motion,
She upon the yellow sand
Drew a rainbow based on ocean ;
Ocean without sea or land.
But the sand I saw not—only,
On the sand the bended bow,
And within it—dim and lonely,
Swung a meteor—to and fro.
Swinging—swinging—like a plummet,
’Till the maiden rose and saith,
"Lo !” and on the glowing summit,
Wrote in golden letters FAITH.
Then the meteor ceased its motion.
Upward rose with deathless ray,
And the rainbow and the ocean,
Faded from my sight away.
Then the silver maiden speaketh,
But with voice so soft and low,
That no word the silence breaketh,
Though their import well I know.
Thus the darkness shall be shivered—
And the crooked be made straight.
And thy soul shall be delivered
If thou faithful watch and wait.

HORACE GREELEY.
We have been importuned to follow up our portraits of “ Mi Boy” and the “Brigadier,” with the portraits of the
other prominent editors of the New York press; and we shall endeavor to do so lest we be accused of partiality towards
our friends of the Mirror. We present our readers this week with a full length portrait of the Editor of the Tribune, which
will be recognized directly by all who know him.
</p><p>Horace Greeley is so widely known by his Tribune, that we could hardly hope to add any thing to the knowledge of the
<lb/>people by giving either an analysis of his genius or a history of his life. It is well known that a few years since he was
<lb/>a journeyman printer in New York, and that he is now the editor and proprietor of a leading daily paper. He first made
<lb/>himself known as the editor of the New Yorker, a very respectable semi-literary weekly newspaper but he has become
<lb/>famous as the editor of the Tribune. Perhaps no paper in the country has exercised a more extended or a healthier influ-
<lb break="no"/>ence upon the public morals. No ordinary man could by the mere force of industry and integrity gain the position of a
<lb/>leading editor, in a political party, at a time like the present, when intelligence is so universally diffused, and men are so
<lb/>exacting of those who labor for them. We may, therefore, safely designate Mr. Greeley as a remarkable man ; if not a
<lb/>genius. The gravest charges that have ever been made against him are, that he eats bran bread and is in favor of Fourier-
<lb break="no"/>ism. The Fourierism we believe he has never denied, but the bran bread is a more questionable matter. We can testify
<lb/>to his eating boiled chicken not long since, and he has confessed that he was partial to good things provided they were
<lb/>not too good. It is a singular fact that the world will forgive anything in a man sooner than self-denial, and we have no
<lb/>doubt that the suspicion of eating bran-bread has gained Mr. Greeley more enemies than his eating up the substance of a
<lb/>dozen widows and orphans in luxurious dinners, could have done.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Greeley owes his eminence mainly to his pen ; people listen to his speeches because they have read his writings.
<lb/>His style is admirably adapted for his uses, but would hardly wear well in a book. He is a disciple of Cobbett, and of
<lb/>course prides himself on grammatical correctness ; but he is ah admirer of Macaulay, and is of course givento flashiness of
<lb/>expression. His coloring is so hot, that his style can never be elevated, because he starts from the top of a subject at the outset.
<lb/>He has yet to learn the advantage of a low tone in his composition. We have rarely seen a piece of writing from his.
<lb/>pen which did not contain the adjectives thrilling, burning or splendid : sometimes these are varied by the use of glorious
<lb/>or brilliant. We take up this morning’s paper, and the first sentence which our eye rests upon is the following paragraph:</p><p>“ The address of Cassius M. Clay to the people of Kentucky, which was given in our last, must electrify every generous and manly heart.
In compactness and force of argument, in fertility and cogency of illustration, in the burning Eloquence of Truth and Conviction, this Address
has rarely if ever been exceeded.”
We have been very careful not t0 caricature Mr. Greeley in our drawing, but it was quite impossioie to give the eleva-
ted expression of bis countenance in this style of engraving.

THE GREAT TOWER OF TARUDANT.
BY ROBERT OLIVER.
Two meanings have our lightest fantasies—
One of the flesh, and of the Spirit one.—Lowell.
</p><p>There was sorrow and lamentation in the city of Tarudant.
<lb/>Wailing voices in her pleasant palaces, and gloomy faces in
<lb/>her crowded streets. The king of Tarudant was dead. The
<lb/>good old king who had reigned so long, that greybearded
<lb/>men remembered not his accession : the good old king who
<lb/>had reigned so well, that no heart in his dominions felt light-
<lb break="no"/>er for his death. Seventy days they mourned him, seventy
<lb/>days and nights, in the city and throughout the kingdom.
<lb/>Very sincere was their mourning, but it could not last for-
<lb break="no"/>ever. Even the best-beloved monarch can be forgotten when
<lb/>the hand of another opens to grasp the descending sceptre.
<lb/>So, on the seventy-first day, grief gave place to joy, tears to
<lb/>smiles, and groans of woe to shouts of gladness and congrat-
<lb break="no"/>ulation.</p><p></p><p>The son of the king, his youngest and only remaining son,
<lb/>had ascended the vacant throne, and thereupon was the sor-
<lb break="no"/>row of the people turned to merriment. And well might
<lb/>they rejoice! For ages the kingdom had not been blessed
<lb/>with a more promising sovereign. While yet his father liv-
<lb break="no"/>ed, Prince Abdallah had won all hearts by his kindness, his
<lb/>generosity, the grace and beauty of his person, and the valor
<lb/>he displayed in repelling the inroads of the neighboring infi-
<lb break="no"/>del tribes—of the Berbers from the mountains and the Tau-
<lb break="no"/>ricks from the desert. Nor was he lacking in graver merits.
<lb/>The age and infirmities of the late king had during the last
<lb/>years of his reign thrown much of the burden of government
<lb/>upon the shoulders of his son, and wisely and strongly was
<lb/>that burden borne. Right well therefore might the people
<lb/>rejoice!</p><p></p><p>Their sanguine hopes were for a time fulfilled. Under
<lb/>the wise and benignant rules of the young king, Tarudant
<lb/>eminently prospered, notwithstanding its limited extent and
<lb/>the comparative barrenness of the regions adjoining the great
<lb/>Sahara. Commerce and population flowed in upon the ca-
<lb break="no"/>pital, while peace and plenty spread their blessings over the
<lb/>provinces. The rich without fear enjoyed their wealth, the
<lb/>poor labored without oppression. Virtue was rewarded and
<lb/>encouraged, crime punished and repressed. Learning and
<lb/>the arts were cultivated and their professors liberally patro-
<lb break="no"/>nized. The wild infidel tribes were scourged back to their
<lb/>remotest haunts, and the bounds of the kingdom enlarged on
<lb/>all sides. Secure and flourishing at home and honored
<lb/>abroad, the subjects of Abdallah were enthusiastic in his
<lb/>praise, and with one voice declared that as vicious monarchs
<lb/>were known to transmit their evil propensities to their chil-
<lb break="no"/>dren who succeeded them, so had the late good king yielded
<lb/>his virtues, tenfold augmented, to his son and successor.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, this happiness was not of long duration.
<lb/>Among the multitude of poets and artists, of astrologers, ma-
<lb break="no"/>gicians and other sages who thronged the splendid court of
<lb/>Tarudant, there was an Egyptian of whom no one knew
<lb/>more, than that in the second year of the king’s reign he had
<lb/>entered the city from the west, riding on a miserab|e camel,
<lb/>unattended even by a boy, and had taken up his residence in
<lb/>one of the vast colleges which the magnificent Abdallah had
<lb/>erected for the entertainment of men of learning. He gave
<lb/>out that he was a magician of great skill and power, and
<lb/>every morning repaired to the royal palace, where until
<lb/>high noon he might be seen squatted at the base of a pillar,
<lb/>with numerous small parchment rolls lying about him, and
<lb/>in his hand a staff formed of three brazen serpents wreathed
<lb/>together. He spoke to no one, but he looked in the face of
<lb/>each passer by, with an expression that besought employ
<lb/>ment, as plainly as words themselves could have done. In
<lb/>the afternoon he walked about the city, silent as ever, but
<lb/>wistfully glancing at each door and window as if momenta-
<lb break="no"/>rily expecting a call for his magical services.</p><p></p><p>Still, for a long lime he found nothing to do. And in truth
<lb/>he was not a very prepossessing magician. In person he
<lb/>was short, even to dwarfishness, with a hump, though not a
<lb/>large one, on his back ; his features were coarse and ill-ar-
<lb break="no"/>ranged, and there was something repulsive, almost disgust-
<lb break="no"/>ing, in his manners and whole appearance. Neither were
<lb/>these bodily defects concealed or softened by ingenious or
<lb/>splendid habiliments. He wore only a single green garment,
<lb/>tattered and dirty, which reached from his head to his heels,
<lb/>and was bound about his waist by a rope of camel’s hair.</p><p></p><p>Who, therefore, could believe that a man so wretchedly
<lb/>formed, so shabbily attired, was in possession of supernatural
<lb/>knowledge and power ? That he could unveil the future
<lb/>and control the world of spirits ? Why, if he could perceive
<lb/>the destined course of events, point out hidden treasures, or
<lb/>subject the genius to his will, surely he might clothe him-
<lb break="no"/>self in fine raiment, and surround himself with all earthly en-
<lb break="no"/>joyments. Yet he was evidently poor, depending for his
<lb/>very bread on the bounty of the king, and seemed depressed
<lb/>in spirit almost to unhappiness. No, no, he was certainly
<lb/>no magician. Besides he was too young to know much, not
<lb/>having a grey hair in his beard. Thus reasoned the people
<lb/>of Tarudant with an ebullition of common sense, such as they
<lb/>seldom displayed when magic or magicians were concerned.</p><p></p><p>Altogether there was little prospect that Arphaxad, lor by
<lb/>this Chaldean name was the Egyptian known, would ever
<lb/>become distinguished or popular. But with all his defects he
<lb/>was at least gifted with two virtues, patience and perseve-
<lb break="no"/>rance. He persisted in his morning attendance at the palace
<lb/>and his afternoon perambulations of the streets, regardless
<lb/>alike of the silent sneers of the courtiers or the audible scoffs
<lb/>of the populace. A year passed on, and then another. In the
<lb/>third year a change occurred in his condition and appearance.
<lb/>He found employment, at first among the lowest of the people
<lb/>and in the most unimportant branches of his art. He did
<lb/>what was required of him with skill and success. He was
<lb/>again employed, again and again. His reputation spread, and
<lb/>at length began to rise. From casting nativities for tailors’
<lb/>children and pointing out hidden springs for well-diggers, he
<lb/>was called to read the stars for emirs and make love-potions
<lb/>for prince’s daughters. His fame finally reached the royal
<lb/>ears, and he was summoned to the presence of the king.</p><p></p><p>He obeyed the summons with the confidence that ever at-
<lb break="no"/>tends the prosperous and popular. He was no longer the de-
<lb break="no"/>sponding and shabby looking personage of a year ago. He
<lb/>had changed with his fortunes. His vestment, though still
<lb/>green in color, was of fine texture and fashionable make; his
<lb/>demeanor was haughty, and wonderful to tell! his stature
<lb/>was enlarged and his countenance endued with a striking,
<lb/>though somewhat disdainful beauty. Attended by pages and
<lb/>running footmen fancifully clad, he rode to the palace” gates
<lb/>on a large he-ass of the famous Damascus breed, black as
<lb/>night, except where here and there a white spot, shaped like
<lb/>a star, broke the dusk of its velvet hide.</p><p></p><p>The glittering courtiers stared with amazement as Arphax-
<lb break="no"/>ad strode through the great hall of the palace, preceded by an
<lb/>emir of rank who was marshalling him to the royal presence.
<lb/>They could recognize the former object of their scorn only by
<lb/>the staff of twisted serpents which he yet retained, and which
<lb/>had been so well polished that it looked like solid gold.</p><p></p><p>“ Can this be the hump-backed Egyptian that used to sit
<lb/>at the base of yonder pillar ?" eagerly enquired one, with his
<lb/>eyes and mouth opened to their fullest extent.</p><p></p><p>“ So it seems,” replied another, more philosophical, or less
<lb/>inquisitive, who carelessly glanced, with a yawn, at the pas-
<lb break="no"/>sing magician, and then resumed the contemplation of his
<lb/>own pearl-embroidered slippers.</p><p></p><p>“ By the beard of the prophet!” exclaimed a third, whose
<lb/>elaborate apparel but indifferently concealed his ungainly
<lb/>proportions, and insignificant stature, “ the dog is a true ma-
<lb break="no"/>gician after all! See, he has got rid of his hump, and if my
<lb/>eyes be not enchanted, he is half a cubit taller than he was
<lb/>a year ago. I must make his acquaintance.”</p><p></p><p>“ His acquaintance would profit thee but little, Cidi Hamet,”
<lb/>said a gigantic officer of the royal guard, looking down with
<lb/>good humored contempt upon the last speaker, “ thou art en-
<lb break="no"/>tirely beneath the reach of magic. Solomon himself, could
<lb/>not straighten thy limbs, or stretch thy body to the proper
<lb/>height of men.’’</p><p>Cidi Hamet winced at the rude sarcasm of the soldier, but
ventured no other reply, than a forced laugh of indifference.
</p><p>“ I do not see what the king can want of this shallow
<lb/>Egyptian, when so many better men are waiting his com-
<lb break="no"/>mands,” muttered an astrologer from Fez, who had been idly

<lb/>the last seven years.</p><p></p><p>“ His tree of life is blossoming like the rose bushes of
<lb/>Hadramut—his fortune is rising like a young palm-tree, we
<lb/>had better make haste and sit in its shade,” chanted a poet
<lb/>from Granada, whose intolerable couplets were held in such
<lb/>general dread, that even in the great hall of the palace, he
<lb/>could always be sure of an undisturbed solitude, so dear to</p><p><pb n="107"/>
</p><p>the pensive poetic soul, and who, in the absence of other lis-
<lb break="no"/>teners, inflicted his verses upon himself with a persevering
<lb/>endurance that would have done honor to an Indian fakir.</p><p></p><p>“Allah il Allah! Fate transcends the finite, and destiny per-
<lb break="no"/>vades with comprehensive perception the unessential ether,
<lb/>but the inextinguishable flame that heretofore envelopes the
<lb/>substantial, cannot be quenched by the volition of that which
<lb/>is palpable,” solemnly enunciated a philosopher from Samar-
<lb break="no"/>cand, who for six months past had daily entertained the people
<lb/>of Tarudant, with discourses of such profundity, that no one
<lb/>had yet been able to understand a syllable of them, and who
<lb/>consequently, was held in high esteem, and surrounded by a
<lb/>very numerous school of disciples.</p><p></p><p>“ God is great! There is no god but God !” shouted a der-
<lb break="no"/>vise from Persia, whose flaming beard and wise looking face
<lb/>always commanded respect, but who had never been known
<lb/>to utter any thing more oracular than the above indisputable
<lb/>truth—perhaps from a deep consciousness of the vanity of
<lb/>all earthly wisdom.</p><p></p><p>While these and similar remarks circulated through the
<lb/>ante-chamber, the Egyptian magician entered the royal pre-
<lb break="no"/>sence and was soon engaged in close conference with the
<lb/>king—a conference that continued till night, and through the
<lb/>night, and far into the succeeding day. It was at length
<lb/>finished and Arphaxad departed, bearing with him a rich robe
<lb/>of honor, such as was granted only to the highest favorites.
<lb/>The wondering courtiers remarked, as they obsequiously
<lb/>made way for him, that even since he entered the palace, a
<lb/>touch of more imperious beauty had been added to his face,
<lb/>and his commanding form rose more loftily than ever.</p><p></p><p>From this time forth, rapid was the elevation, and emi-
<lb break="no"/>nent the prosperity of the magician. He was made first an
<lb/>emir, then a vizier, and finally, grand-vizier. In all these
<lb/>posts, he distinguished himself by his sagacity, energy, and
<lb/>activity. He so wisely counselled the king, and so ably
<lb/>executed the royal commands, that the kingdom of Tarudant
<lb/>flourished as no kingdom ever did, save when Solomon
<lb/>reigned in Israel. The magical power of the Egyptian grew
<lb/>more potent as he himself increased in dignity and its con-
<lb break="no"/>sequent wealth ; for the success of his principal incantations,
<lb/>depended mainly on the employment of certain rare and costly
<lb/>ingredients, which none could procure but the rich and
<lb/>powerful; and with these at his command, he was enabled
<lb/>to enslave numerous mighty genies, by whose aid the
<lb/>most stupendous labors were performed. The provinces
<lb/>were covered with vast works—aqueducts, canals, reservoirs,
<lb/>and water-wheels, intended to correct the sterility of the soil
<lb/>and facilitate cultivation—roads, bridges, and caravanserais,
<lb/>for the acommodation of commerce and travel. The cities
<lb/>were filled with superb edifices, erected alike for ornament
<lb/>and use—with palaces, mosques, colleges, libraries, khans,
<lb/>bazaars, and baths. Nor was the defence of the kingdom
<lb/>less cared for than its splendor and convenience. Strong
<lb/>towers rose on every hill-top, and impregnable castles guard-
<lb break="no"/>ed every mountain-pass. Each city was surrounded by a
<lb/>treble wall of prodigious height and thickness, and the capital,
<lb/>Tarudant itself, was encompassed with a mound of stone, so
<lb/>high that its shadow covered a third part of the city, and so
<lb/>broad, that its summit sustained trees sufficient to form a
<lb/>considerable forest.</p><p></p><p>Great armies were also raised, in whose ranks genies min-
<lb break="no"/>gled with men, and conquests were made upon all sides, ex-
<lb break="no"/>cept towards the east, where the mighty chain of Mount At-
<lb break="no"/>las reared its white tops to heaven, presenting so formidable
<lb/>an aspect, that even the charm-guarded warriors of the
<lb/>Egyptian shrank from attempting to pass the desert which
<lb/>lay between the mountains and the eastern border of the
<lb/>kingdom.</p><p></p><p>Protected by the mighty fortifications, guarded by the in-
<lb break="no"/>vincible armies, and aided by the vast and cunningly contri-
<lb break="no"/>ved works of the magician, the people of Tarudant waxed
<lb/>rich and numerous, for so great and wide-spread became the
<lb/>renown of king Abdallah, and his sage vizier, that multitudes
<lb/>from other nations, bringing with them their gold, and silver,
<lb/>and precious stones, and costliest goods, flocked into the
<lb/>kingdom, eager to sit in the shade of its protection, and to
<lb/>bask in the sunshine of its prosperity. They came, not only
<lb/>from the neighboring Fez, Tafilet, and Morocco, but from
<lb/>Granada, and Egypt, and even from remote Persia and India.
<lb/>So the kingdom overflowed with wealth and population.
<lb/>Caravans bearing rich burdens animated its plains with
<lb/>endless processions. Buyers and sellers crowded the capa-</p><p></p><p>cious bazaars. From morn till eve, the air resounded with
<lb/>the din and clangor of innumerable work-shops—from eve till
<lb/>morn, the darkness was cheered by the blaze of festivity, and
<lb/>the shouts of sport and merriment. Unceasing were the
<lb/>praises bestowed by the happy and grateful people on the
<lb/>good king and his wise vizier, whose administration had pro-
<lb break="no"/>duced such wonderfully beneficial results.	</p><p></p><p>But magicians, and especially Egyptian magicians, though
<lb/>excellent servants, are very bad masters. And whether it be
<lb/>from an aspiring nature, or from habits of imperious command
<lb/>acquired in the exercise of their dominion over spirits, they
<lb/>ever seek to obtain unlimited control of all with whom they
<lb/>are brought into contact. He who had worked such marvels
<lb/>in the kingdom of Tarudant, began to be mightily elated by
<lb/>the success that attended his efforts, and the praises that
<lb/>were lavished upon his achievements. His stature, already
<lb/>great, increased and increased, until it was fairly gigantic;
<lb/>and the haughty beauty of his face became so imposing, that
<lb/>at length it was almost fearful to look upon. His green gar-
<lb break="no"/>ment grew more and more vivid in its hue, and the Damas-
<lb break="no"/>cus ass on which he invariably rode, augmented to a size
<lb/>proportioned to that of its master.</p><p></p><p>Long ago the magician had taken up his abode in the royal
<lb/>palace, so as to be ever at the king’s right hand. He con-
<lb break="no"/>structed for himself apartments more spacious and splendid
<lb/>than even those of the monarch, from which they were sepa-
<lb break="no"/>rated only by a long narrow court, planted with fig trees.
<lb/>Here he dwelt in great pomp, surrounded by a guard of black
<lb/>genies, armed with highly polished brazen swords, who held
<lb/>themselves always in readiness to execute his least command.</p><p></p><p>Day by day, something was added to this state and to
<lb/>the number of these guards. And day by day, the magician
<lb/>became more haughty and domineering. Favored by the
<lb/>king, and popular with the people, there was nothing to
<lb/>check his ambition, except the feeble opposition of a few su-
<lb break="no"/>perannuated viziers, who gravely shook their gray heads, and
<lb/>muttered their doubt “ whether any good would come of all
<lb/>this.” But as such had been, for years, their invariable re-
<lb break="no"/>ception of every thing new, no one paid any attention to
<lb/>their sage warnings, and they were merely laughed at as
<lb/>men behind the age.</p><p>(To be continued.)
THE CONCERT ROOM.
Gratuitous Services at Charitable Concerts.--Our
</p><p>attention has often been called to this subject, and we have
<lb/>frequently determined to discuss it in all its bearings. We
<lb/>have been hitherto prevented from fulfilling our intentions,
<lb/>but we will do so no now, for it is high time to understand
<lb/>in what relation the professor, the beneficiary and the pub-
<lb break="no"/>lic, stand towards each other, under such circumstances.</p><p></p><p>Every high-minded man must be an advocate of the cause
<lb/>of charity. It is a sacred, a holy cause, and one to which
<lb/>every one should willingly contribute his mite. But we
<lb/>were always of opinion that professional people have ever
<lb/>been too highly taxed. They are applied to upon every tri-
<lb break="no"/>vial occasion; benefits, charities, hospitals, churches, com-
<lb break="no"/>pliments, in short, every week brings forth some necessity
<lb/>for their valuable services. They are supposed to possess
<lb/>souls overflowing with the milk of human kindness, and
<lb/>stuffed to repletion with the most extended philanthropy ; for
<lb/>every sect, of every denomination, from the Catholic to the
<lb/>Jew, appeals to their sympathy and their benevolence. This
<lb/>may seem all very natural to those who do not reflect upon
<lb/>the subject, who think it is only giving up one evening to
<lb/>the service of charity, which certainly cannot hurt them, it
<lb/>costs them nothing. This is a false and fatal conclusion. It
<lb/>costs them in fact ten times more than it does those who are
<lb/>known to the wealthy, and who are by the world deemed
<lb/>liberal. Supposing a charitable subscription were opened,
<lb/>and application made to a professor of music, surely, five
<lb/>dollars would be considered a liberal donation. Contrast
<lb/>this small amount with the sum, in a measure demanded, in
<lb/>the services of a professor. We will mention two instances,</p><p><pb n="108"/>
</p><p>one of them Madame Otto. Within the last six months,
<lb/>this lady, whose kindness and disinterested nature is well
<lb/>known, has given away in gratuitous services, no less a sum
<lb/>than five hundred dollars. Mrs. Edward Loder has in the
<lb/>like manner, during the short time she has been in this coun-
<lb break="no"/>try, given away in charity not less than fifteen hundred dol-
<lb break="no"/>lars, and on some occasions has been compelled to relinquish
<lb/>lucrative engagements which offered, after having allowed
<lb/>her name to be announced in a Benefit bill. These are facts
<lb/>to which every professor in the city will bear witness. Nor
<lb/>does the loss end here; dresses must be bought, gloves,
<lb/>shoes, and coach hire provided for, and lessons must be
<lb/>missed in order that rehearsals may be attended. And yet,
<lb/>for all these sacrifices of time and money, what considera-
<lb break="no"/>tion do they meet with in the community when they apply
<lb/>for assistance at a concert for their benefit ? If we look
<lb/>through the lists of concerts for the two past years, we shall
<lb/>not find more than six concerts given by resident professors,
<lb/>and most of these were positive failures. One of these,
<lb/>given by a gentleman universally esteemed for his readiness
<lb/>to do any act of kindness when called upon, and which held
<lb/>out every attraction of novelty and excellence, did not yield
<lb/>him sufficient to pay one half of the lessons he was compelled
<lb/>to miss in order to get it up.</p><p></p><p>It is a fact which we grieve to state, that every effort of
<lb/>this kind made by a resident professor, is utterly discounte
<lb/>nanced by the citizens; the encouragement so lavishly be-
<lb break="no"/>stowed upon Ethiopian serenaders and wandering families,
<lb/>is determinedly withheld from the laborious and worthy resi-
<lb break="no"/>dent. What encouragement have they then to be liberal,
<lb/>when their liberality meets with no return ?</p><p></p><p>We believe that the position of Professors of Music, with
<lb/>regard to charitable societies, is this: that at such concerts
<lb/>where their abilities and attractions are necessary to raise
<lb/>funds for said societies, that some proportion of the gains
<lb/>should go to those who earned them at a sacrifice of time and
<lb/>money.</p><p></p><p>For several months in the year, professors of music are
<lb/>almost without employment—a portion of the year dead to
<lb/>them, as regards income. The winter season is their har-
<lb break="no"/>vest time alone. Time is short, and time is to them money,
<lb/>or in other words provision for the coming summer, and every
<lb/>non-remunerating engagement is a positive and irreparable
<lb/>loss.</p><p>Under such circumstances, too much should not be asked,
when in return nothing is given.
</p><p>In our next we shall treat of the duties of professors to-
<lb break="no"/>wards the public, after having gratuitously allowed them to
<lb/>appear as performers upon particular occasions. Under this
<lb/>head we shall particularly notice the benefit of the Trans-
<lb break="no"/>figuration Church on Sunday evening last.</p><p>VARIETIES.
CHEAP POSTAGE.
</p><p>It is truly astonishing to see with what pertinacity our
<lb/>legislators cling to old abuses, and with what eagerness they
<lb/>adopt new ones. The people have year after year petitioned
<lb/>and begged for a reform in our Post Office system without
<lb/>the least success ; some of the keenest intellects in the
<lb/>country have demonstrated time after time that a reduction
<lb/>in the rates of postage would cause an increase in the reve-
<lb break="no"/>nue of that department of the Government, without being
<lb/>able to convince the functionary at the head of the bureau, or a
<lb/>majority of the members of Congress. But the President
<lb/>recommends the annexation of a foreign territory by joint re-
<lb break="no"/>solution of Congress, and his hint is acted upon with indecent</p><p></p><p>haste, notwithstanding that the people declare themselves
<lb/>opposed to the measure. But we discern a glimpse of morn-
<lb break="no"/>ing breaking out from this darkness. The joint resolution
<lb/>will not pass both houses, and the cheap postage has already
<lb/>passed one and may pass the other. We hope so. There is
<lb/>no need of argument upon the subject at this day, for no pro-
<lb break="no"/>ject has ever had more lavished upon it, while nothing has
<lb/>appeared against it.</p><p></p><p>We believe that one of the most important actors in this
<lb/>business has been Mr. James W. Hale, of this city, whose en-
<lb break="no"/>terprise and courage in establishing a private express between
<lb/>New York, Boston and Philadelphia, first opened the eyes of
<lb/>the gentlemen who are called the government to the danger
<lb/>they incurred of having a rival Post Office department, unless
<lb/>they submitted to a reform of the present scandalous system
<lb/>of taxing the nation, which results in good to nobody. The
<lb/>rates of postage fixed by the bill which has just passed the
<lb/>Senate, we believe to be too high; and the consequence will
<lb/>be that the private expresses will continue to carry letters at
<lb/>a less rate than the government. But, we trust that the bill
<lb/>will become a law, notwithstanding. It is of great impor-
<lb break="no"/>tance in many points of view, but most so as encouraging the
<lb/>people to persevere in petitioning Congress, and in writing to
<lb/>members individually, in behalf of any measure which they
<lb/>would have carried. We hope to see an international copy-
<lb break="no"/>right bill passed at the next session by these means.</p><p></p><p>But while we congratulate the people on the achievement
<lb/>of their wishes in the passage of the postage reform bill, we
<lb/>must not forget those spirited individuals who have labored
<lb/>so strenuously the last two or three years to bring it about.
<lb/>The New World has contained some admirable papers on
<lb/>the subject, which we have understood were from the pen of
<lb/>Barnabis Bates. The Tribune has also been untiring and
<lb/>indefatigable in the cause, and from its great circulation, and
<lb/>influence among politicians, must have done much towards
<lb/>bringing our representatives to their senses. The entire
<lb/>press, we believe, has favored the measure, but our Congress-
<lb break="no"/>ional Pharoahs hardened their hearts against all argument,
<lb/>until Mr. Hale began to demonstrate to them that, if let alone
<lb/>a little longer, the people would adopt him for their Post
<lb/>Master General, and not trouble them any more upon the sub-
<lb break="no"/>ject.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Hale has, at this time, no less than ninety-six branch
<lb/>offices, and nearly three hundred assistants; during the past
<lb/>year he has paid twenty thousand dollars for conductors and
<lb/>office expresses, and twenty-five hundred dollars in defending
<lb/>himself in suits brought against him by Government. Judges
<lb/>Betts and Conkling of New York, and Sprague of Massa-
<lb break="no"/>chusetts, District Judges of the U. S., and Mr. Justice Story
<lb/>of the Supreme Court, are in favor of private mails, or at least
<lb/>believe them to be legal, while Judges Randall of Pennsylva-
<lb break="no"/>nia, and Heath, of Maryland, decide otherwise.</p><p></p><p>If the bill that has passed the Senate should become a
<lb/>law, the private mails will probably be abolished; but the
<lb/>carrying of letters between the principal cities on the Atlan-
<lb break="no"/>tic coast would be a very profitable business at a penny
<lb/>each, and if the Supreme Court should decide that the Con-
<lb break="no"/>stitution does not prohibit private mails, the establishment
<lb/>of Mr. Hale's will continue to do as large a business as it
<lb/>does now. That the Post Office system is on the whole
<lb/>injurious to the welfare of the country we have no doubt;
<lb/>and we look upon the bill just passed by the Senate as an
<lb/>indication of its entire abolition at no very distant day.</p><p></p><p>Apropos des Bottes.—Speaking of letters, reminds us to remind
<lb/>our readers that the indefatigable manager of the U. S. City Despatch
<lb/>Post Office, has engaged two or three hundred extra carriers to distri-
<lb break="no"/>bute Valentines ; so that all will be delivered in time that may be sent.</p><p><pb n="109"/>
THEFTS OF AMERICAN AUTHORS.
</p><p>“ Somebody is a thief,” said the critic of the Mirror a few
<lb/>days since, when commenting on Longfellow's “Waif.”
<lb/>The occasion of the remark was a comparison of the follow-
<lb break="no"/>ing lines by Hood—</p><p>We watched her breathing through the night,
Her breathing soft and low.
As in her breast the wave of life
Kept heaving to and fro.
So silently we seemed to speak,
So slowly moved about,
At we had lent her half our powers
To eke her being out.
Our very hope belied our fears;
Our fears our hopes belied ;
We thought her dying when she slept,
And sleeping when she died.
For when the mom came dim and sad,
And chill with early showers,
Her quiet eye lids closed :—the had
Another morn than ours.
with these stanzas by Mr. Aldrich—
Her sufferings ended with the day,
Yet lived she at its close,
And breathed the long, long night away
In statue-like repose;
But when the sun in all its state
Illumed the eastern skies,
She passed through Glory’s morning gate,
And walked in paradise.
</p><p>We can discover no resemblance between these verses,
<lb/>sufficient to warrant the charge of plagiarism, excepting the
<lb/>measure and the subject, which are certainly not peculiar to
<lb/>Hood; the thoughts are by no means identical. We are
<lb/>very sure that the Mirror would not be guilty of accusing any
<lb/>one of a literary theft without good reason, but we do not
<lb/>perceive the warrant for the accusation in this case. Mr.
<lb/>Aldrich is the last man in the world to be guilty of so disre-
<lb break="no"/>putable an artifice, and certainly would never have commit-
<lb break="no"/>ted a theft of this kind, which would have been certain to
<lb/>meet with instant detection. The truth is, that his lines ap-
<lb break="no"/>peared in the New World in 1840: and two years afterward,
<lb/>when Hood’s lines first appeared, he copied them himself into
<lb/>the same paper, of which he had become an assistant editor.
<lb/>There is certainly a curious coincidence of feeling between
<lb/>the verses of Mr. Aldrich, and those of Hood; but such things
<lb/>are very common in all the poets, from Homer downwards.
<lb/>There is no such thing as originality of sentiment; expres-
<lb break="no"/>sion is all that any poet can claim as his own. There is
<lb/>hardly a name in Mr. Griswold’s catalogue of American po-
<lb break="no"/>ets, less obnoxious to the charge of plagiarism than that of
<lb/>James Aldrich.</p><p></p><p>Charges of plagiarism are very frequently made, and often
<lb/>with good reason, against our popular authors, but we doubt
<lb/>whether any man, with a reputation worth having, would
<lb/>knowingly commit himself in this manner. The greatest
<lb/>writers have always been the greatest plagiarists, or at least
<lb/>they have been most frequently accused of this sin. But we
<lb/>believe that no author who can claim anything as his own
<lb/>ever suffered in his reputation from having used the thoughts
<lb/>of other writers. The “ Rover” of last week contains a very
<lb/>grave charge against Longfellow of passing off in Graham’s
<lb/>Magazine a ballad of Motherwell’s as a translation from the
<lb/>Herman, which, if true, would lead us to distrust everything
<lb/>that came from his pen. But the best way in such cases, is
<lb/>to hunt up the proof, before so serious a charge is made
<lb/>against an author whose reputation belongs not to himself
<lb/>alone, bat to his country.</p><p></p><p>The charge of plagiarism against Mrs. Ellet—which we
<lb/>think should have been called “an unblushing charge of
<lb/>Plagiarism” rather than “ a charge of unblushing plagiarism”</p><p></p><p>—is thus noticed in the Southern Chronicle, published at
<lb/>Columbia, S. C., where Mrs. Ellet resides. The numerous
<lb/>friends of Mrs. Ellet needed no explanation, and it seems
<lb/>marvellous, that any person connected with the press should
<lb/>honestly have mistaken the matter.</p><p></p><p>“ Still another, and a more injurious wrong, is sometimes done of
<lb/>which authors have to suffer the inconvenience. A newspaper copies
<lb/>a tale, which is part, or wholly a translation from some foreign lan-
<lb break="no"/>guage, and leaves out the acknowledgment, publishing it as original.
<lb/>For example, a story that appeared a few months since in the Demo-
<lb break="no"/>cratic Review, entitled 'Blind Jaques’—a translation from the French
<lb/>—we saw republished in one of the city papers, without the acknow-
<lb break="no"/>ledgment that it had been in the Review, and with the translator’s
<lb/>name paraded in staring capitals as the author of the tale Thus, for
<lb/>the sake of saving the printer a couple of minute’s work, a positive
<lb/>wrong is done, and an innocent person subjected to the charge of
<lb/>plagiarism, which is, perhaps, re-echoed by the very paper whose
<lb/>culpable neglect occasioned it! We sincerely hope, for the sake of
<lb/>honor, and truth, and justice, if not of courtesy, that such doings may
<lb/>not be repeated. A word to the wise, we trust, will be sufficient.”</p><p>THE MAGAZINES.
</p><p>We have received No. l. of the Aristidean, a Magazine of Reviews,
<lb/>Politics, and light Literature, for March, 1845, edited by Thomas Dunn
<lb/>English, and published by Lane &amp;. Co., 304 Broadway. Price five dol-
<lb break="no"/>lars per annum.</p><p></p><p>The plan of this new Magazine is altogether admirable ; we can
<lb/>conceive of nothing better in the form of a magazine, than a monthly
<lb/>miscellany that “ combines the solidity of the Review and the light-
<lb break="no"/>ness of the Magazine, with the political cast of the newspaper.” And
<lb/>then "the politics of the Aristidean is democratic,” “ it sustains the
<lb/>abolition of the death punishment,” “ it advocates equal rights,” “ it
<lb/>labors to be just.” All these good things we pick out of the publisher’s
<lb/>advertisement. They are true, of course. Nothing can be finer, no-
<lb break="no"/>thing better suited to the wants of the public, but, we fear, nothing less
<lb/>likely to be accomplished. However, it is an important point to have
<lb/>a good aim, and Mr. English is certainly entitled to the consideration
<lb/>of the public for his good intentions, even though he should fall some-
<lb break="no"/>what short of the mark he aims at. The first article in the Aristidean
<lb/>advocates the annexation of Texas to the United States; a measure, to
<lb/>our perception, as little savoring of the spirit of Aristides as any that
<lb/>could be proposed. The next article is a drinking song as little Aristi-
<lb break="no"/>dean as the paper on Texas.</p><p>The last stanza runs thus—
"Old Sampson and Cӕsar—
Each man was a sneezer—
Tossed off, with a will, rosy wine;
While Ovid, the scamp, he
With Cato and Pompey,
Drank three bottles each when they’d dine.
So we tread in the steps of the famous in rhyme—
The jolly old Cocks of the gone-sway time.”
</p><p>What puzzles us most in this article is the difficulty of classing it;
<lb/>whether with “ the solidity of the review,” or, “ the lightness of the
<lb/>magazine.” We don’t know which. Article III. is a notice of
<lb/>George Jones’s Ancient America, the fairest specimen of an elegant
<lb/>book that we have seen in many a day. The notice is funny enough,
<lb/>and it has a little vignette by Darley, worthy of Punch. This article
<lb/>might have been written by Aristides himself without casting a sha-
<lb break="no"/>dow upon his reputation. The “ Mouse Trap,” “ Hell and the Mael-
<lb break="no"/>strom,” and the article on Bishop Onderdonk, are not exactly in the
<lb/>ordinary magazine strain. Nobody will accuse the Aristidean of sham.
<lb/>by-pambyism, let them accuse it of what other sins they may. Mr.
<lb/>English has had the courage to project a magazine different from the
<lb/>prevailing fashion in such publications, and we trust that he will re-
<lb break="no"/>ceive the support that he deserves; probably he would ask for nothing
<lb/>more himself.</p><p></p><p>Magazine literature is the only literature that can flourish among us
<lb/>until we have an international copyright law ; we therefore look with
<lb/>an eye of favor upon every new candidate that appears among us ; and
<lb/>instead of taking them as they come out, and weighing them in the
<lb/>balance with Blackwood’s Magazine, as our reading public are in the
<lb/>habit of doing, they should be received kindly, at least, and where we
<lb/>have no patronage to bestow, we should withhold our disparagements.
<lb/>A book, by itself, is getting every day rarer and rarer in our literature,
<lb/>and there being no other channel than the Magazine for our thoughts
<lb/>to flow in, the Magazine should be cherished until a better day dawn
<lb/>upon us.</p><p><pb n="110"/>
LITERARY NOTICES.
A Plea for Woman, being a Vindication of the importance and extent of her
natural .sphere of action. By Mrs. Hugo Reid; with an introduction by
Mrs. C. M. Kirkland. New York: Farmer &amp; Daggers, 30 Ann street.
</p><p>The introduction to this book, by the accomplished author of
<lb/>Forest Life, is one of the most felicitous essays that we have seen
<lb/>from her pen, although it is not in her peculiar vein. Her recommen-
<lb break="no"/>dation of the work, is a guarantee of its claims to notice. “ Woman’s
<lb/>Rights” is a subject that we have never seen the propriety of handling
<lb/>with the kind of inconsiderate flippancy in which it is generally done.
<lb/>The motto of this little work is suggestive of all the wisdom belonging
<lb/>to the subject:</p><p>“Can man be free if woman be a slave ?”
</p><p>Assuredly not. In all ages, the relative rights of men and women have
<lb/>been the same ; when we think of the Hindoo widow throwing herself
<lb/>upon the funeral pyre of her husband, we must not forget the condition
<lb/>of the husband himself when alive, nor the men who suffer by the
<lb/>wrongs of the wife. It appears to us that the surest way for women
<lb/>to gain their rights—always supposing that they do not enjoy them—
<lb/>is to train up their children properly, and they will see that their mo-
<lb break="no"/>thers suffer no wrong. When women dissipate their days and nights
<lb/>in idle amusements, and squander their incomes in dress, while their

</p><p>We omitted, by accident, to mention this excellent periodical in our
<lb/>last week’s Review. The present number contains some admirable
<lb/>articles, and a good many valuable tables. One of the most amusing
<lb/>papers that we have read in a long while, is an article on the last Cen-
<lb break="no"/>sus. It is written in all seriousness, but it reveals a series of blunders,
<lb/>and perverted facts, in the census returns, more laughable than any
<lb/>thing which Punch has uttered during the past year; it proves very
<lb/>plainly that the census is not worth a copper, and that its returns are
<lb/>more likely to be wrong than right. Yet, after all, it is no doubt as
<lb/>correct as any census ever was, or ever will be.</p><p></p><p>The Monthly Rose. Vol. I. No. 2. A periodical sustained by the present

<lb/>every work on the cultivation of the soil, which has been published in

<lb/>which have issued from the British press. They have done much to-

</p><p>Schnol for the Arts of Design.—The Mechanic’s Institute of
<lb/>this city have established an Evening School for the Arts of Design, as
<lb/>applied to the mechanic Arts, and their success is fully equal to the
<lb/>most sanguine expectations of the friends of the project. In addition
<lb/>to a well selected assortment of casts from the Antique, they have im-
<lb break="no"/>ported from France, copies of the best specimens of scroll work and
<lb/>arabesque ornament. T. Cummings, Paul R. Duggan, and the President
<lb/>of the Institute, act as teachers, and the pupils have produced some
<lb/>drawings which would not disgrace the exhibition of the National
<lb/>Academy of Design. The benefits to result from this course are al-
<lb break="no"/>ready well understood, and we may fairly hope, that at no distant pe-
<lb break="no"/>riod of time, our mechanical products will equal the classical beauty
<lb/>of those of France, where the Arts of Design form part of a common
<lb/>school education. Classes have also been formed in mechanical draw-
<lb break="no"/>ing, mathematics as applied to the mechanic Arts, Chemistry, &amp;c., &amp;c.
<lb/>The Conversational meetings of the Institute are also very useful to
<lb/>its members, and under its present spirited organization, it is certainly
<lb/>worthy the support of our citizens generally.</p><p></p><p>The Common Council have unanimously resolved to allow the use of
<lb/>the building in the Park, known as the Rotunda, to the New York
<lb/>Gallery of the Fine Arts, at an annual rent of one dollar We are
<lb/>heartily rejoiced at this manifestation of right feeling in the represen-
<lb break="no"/>tatives of the people, which we trust will be followed by other evidence
<lb/>of an appreciation of the importance of Art. We think that the inter-
<lb break="no"/>ests of the people would have been better served by a removal of the
<lb/>building, but if it is to stand, it could not be put to a better use than
<lb/>that to which it is happily appropriated.</p><p>MUSICAL INTELLIGENCE.

<lb/>expected to yield a great per centage in time.</p><p></p><p>We have heard, however, of another project, which, according to

<lb/>known as Niblo’s Garden, on the site of which it is proposed that a</p><p>splendid Opera House, Concert Room and Hotel shall be built. The
situation is undoubtedly superior to that chosen by the Up-Town Ho-
tel people.

<lb/>presented to him a MS. composition of M. Vieuxtemps. It is an offer-
<lb break="no"/>torium consisting of a duett for soprano voice and violin, with chorus
<lb/>and fall orchestral accompaniments. The solo parts will be, we be-

CORRESPONDENCE.
For the Broadway Journal.
"With all our boasting of American genius, we have not yet been
able to design a pattern for a cap ribbon.”

<lb/>up on that subject.</p><p></p><p>A friend of the writer, seven years ago, imported cap and bonnet rib-

<lb/>here, also from original designs of Americans, not artists, but mer-
<lb break="no"/>chants, can be showed to the editor if desired.</p><p></p><p>The writer sends this correction, because he supposed the author of
<lb/>the above article would have no objection to be corrected in a matter
<lb/>which, although of little moment in itself, reflects upon the taste and
<lb/>ingenuity of a class of men who are supposed by the literary portion of
<lb/>the community, to have no ideas beyond those engendered and foster-
<lb break="no"/>ed by the almighty dollar.	s. a. w.</p><p></p><p>[We give place to the above communication with great pleasure, for

<lb break="no"/>ing combinations of colors in a style of goods, whose sole value depends

</p><p>Mr. Editor—While reading the fifth nnmber of your paper, I was
<lb/>much struck by an article entitled, Barbarities of the Theatre. Since
<lb/>then it has been forcibly recalled to my memory, by an accident which
<lb/>I myself witnessed at the Chatham theatre, only last week. A young
<lb/>lady, Miss Orville, came forward to sing a song. She was clad in a full
<lb/>dress of some light material. The symphony was scarcely finished,
<lb/>when a draught of air blew her dress towards the footlights; it was im-
<lb break="no"/>mediately in flames, but the leader of the orchestra, with a prompti-
<lb break="no"/>tude which reflects great credit upon his humanity, leaned over and
<lb/>struck the dress with his bow; this attracted the young lady’s atten-
<lb break="no"/>tion, who with admirable presence of mind, though with difficulty, ex-
<lb break="no"/>tinguished the flames. The pit greeted the accident with a shout of
<lb/>laughter, which was immediately drowned by a hearty burst of ap-
<lb break="no"/>plause from other parts of the house.</p><p></p><p>But for her coolness and self-possession in so fearful a situation, Miss
<lb/>Orville might have met with a fate similar to that of the unfortunate
<lb/>Miss Clara Webster. I do trust, Mr. Editor, that you will, for the sake
<lb/>of humanity, wield your powerful pen in the endeavor to correct this
<lb/>wanton negligence on the part of managers.</p><p>I remain; your obedient servant,
New York, Feb. 5, 1845.	A Reader.
To the Editor of the Broadway Journal.
Dear Mr Editor,
</p><p>Im a surprised that you print our letters; we only wrote to you
<lb/>for advice. I am sure I shall never get over seeing my name in a news-
<lb break="no"/>paper. It is dreadful. Who knows but somebody will think that I am
<lb/>a writer ? I should be mortified to death if they did. I never heard of
<lb/>such a thing as printing a lady’s letter; if you do it again I shall not
<lb/>like it at all, and my brother will stop the paper. But there is one
<lb/>thing that I would like to know. The boys are forever talking about
<lb/>Japonica-dom,—and I can’t for the life of me find out what it means.
<lb/>What is it ? I think it must be the people who wear japanned leather;
<lb/>is it not ? It seems to me that the young men now-a-days do a goop
<lb/>many ridiculous things; among the other strange words which the
<lb/>boys use, is tricity this and tricity that. It is positively dreadful. The
<lb/>other night when I took William to do for speaking so freely about
<lb/>brandy and water, he replied to me, "Don’t bother xne with your
<lb/>aunt-tricity." I am sure I was never more shocked in my life. It is
<lb/>dreadful. Please answer my queries without printing my letter, but to
<lb/>prevent exposure, I sign myself only</p><p>Your Friend.
</p><p>P. S. The punning gentleman has lately begun upon conundrums, and
<lb/>be called upon us in the midst of the snow storm to tell us that a bon-
<lb break="no"/>net is not a bonnet when it becomes a lady. Such dreadful trash ! Of
<lb/>course nobody laughed but the gentleman himself. Do you think that
<lb/>conundrums are as immoral as puns ? I mean to ask Dr. Slospoken.</p><p>MENDELSSOHN’S LOBGESANG.
