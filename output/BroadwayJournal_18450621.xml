THE ADVENTURES OF A GENTLEMAN IN SEARCH OF A DINNER.
RELATED BY HIMSELF.
</p><p>In the year eighteen hundred and something, I forget the
<lb/>figures, but it was the year of the cholera in New York, I be-
<lb break="no"/>came acquainted in Paris with a gentleman of my own years
<lb/>named Julius Bartol. Our first meeting was at a ball at the
<lb/>American Ambassador’s, and our last at the Rocher, where we
<lb/>had such a dinner as the Rocher alone could produce. Bartol
<lb/>was a New Yorker by birth, and he gloried in being called a
<lb/>Knickerbocker, but his tastes, his predilections, his habits and
<lb/>his education were thoroughly French. He had been sent to
<lb/>Paris at an early age to be placed in a commercial Academy,
<lb/>for his father was a merchant and meant that his son should
<lb/>be one; but before his education was completed, old Bartol
<lb/>died and left him a very large estate. He abandoned the idea
<lb/>of business, and after spending a few years in Paris returned
<lb/>to New York, and married a lady with an estate equal to his
<lb/>own. His position in society, from his great wealth, being in-
<lb break="no"/>finitely above my own, I had purposely avoided him after his
<lb/>return home, but one day as I was crossing the Park, after
<lb/>having suffered martyrdom in a cross-examination by two im-
<lb break="no"/>pertinent lawyers in the City Hall, I met him and he express-
<lb break="no"/>ed so much unaffected good will towards me, that I accepted
<lb/>an invitation to dine with him the next day.</p><p>“ You remember our dinner at the Rocher ?” said Bartol.
“ Remember it,” I replied, “as the Hoosier said, I remem-
ber nothing else.”
</p><p>“ Very good,” said Bartol, “ I am glad to hear it, I will give
<lb/>you a better one to-morrow ; our cook is a second Vatel; but
<lb/>that is nothing; my wife will dine with us, and you shall know
<lb/>what it is to sit down with an angel. But come early and romp
<lb/>with my little girls before dinner; there will be but two or
<lb/>three friends besides."</p><p></p><p>I am no glutton, I am not even a bon vivant, but I have a
<lb/>passion for good dinners, and although I have a tolerably en-
<lb break="no"/>thusiastic feeling for works of what are called fine art, I am
<lb/>not ashamed to own that no tableau ever charmed me like a
<lb/>well appointed table. The extent of the benefit to be derived
<lb/>from a picture is a momentary sensation of pleasure, but the
<lb/>benefits of a good table are health, life, cheerfulness, content,
<lb/>pleasant dreams and a lively fancy. There can be no doubt
<lb/>that infinite harm has been done in our day by the wickedness
<lb/>of business and learned men, in affecting an indifference to
<lb/>the table. All stoicism is false and injurious, but the stoicism
<lb/>of the dinner table is the most false and injurious of all. We
<lb/>make the most lavish and ostentatious provisions for the nurture
<lb/>of the mind, but leave the body to the mercies of the most ig-
<lb break="no"/>norant and degraded parties of our household; and, as if we
<lb/>were afraid of enjoying good health, we heap every term of
<lb/>contempt upon the servant in whose integrity and skill the
<lb/>health of body and mind depend, namely, the cook. Perhaps
<lb/>much of the indifference shown towards the table, is owing to
<lb/>the frequency of our meals, which allowing us no time to gain
<lb/>an appetite, renders eating rather a nauseous duty, than a keen</p><p></p><p>delight. It is surprising that among our classicists, no one has
<lb/>ever thought of imitating the Romans in regard to their meals.
<lb/>They, as is well known, ate but once a day, and then they
<lb/>came to their dinners with good appetites and a lively sense of
<lb/>the importance of the duty of eating. Dispepsia was unknown
<lb/> among them, and any schoolboy will talk to you of Roman
<lb/> firmness, of Roman courage, of Roman patriotism and a thous-
<lb break="no"/>and other virtues, which I fear will never be honored by an
<lb/>American prefix. And then what arms and legs, and necks
<lb/> and shoulders, do sculptors and painters give to Roman
<lb/>soldiers and even Roman poets. To sum up the whole matter
<lb/> in two words, the Romans dined but once a day and conquered
<lb/> the world. Gen. Jackson has sometimes been called an old
<lb/>Roman, and one of his admirers has lately sent him the sarco-
<lb break="no"/> phagus of Alexander Severus for his coffin ; but there is as
<lb/>much difference between the shrunk shanks of the modern and
<lb/>the thews and sinews of the old Roman, as there is between
<lb/>the wooden coffins of the modem and the marbles ones of the
<lb/>ancients. We must go back to the one meal system before
<lb/> stone coffins will seem applicable for our slender carcasses. It
<lb/>is the pernicious system of eating four times a day that has
<lb/>led to the invention of all the salmis and potages, which cause
<lb/>gout, dyspepsia and dropsy, by tempting us to eat when we
<lb/> have no inclination for the table ; but eating once a day would
<lb/> not only lead us to attach more importance to the ethics of the
<lb/>table, but would save us from the frightful amount of charla-
<lb break="no"/>tanry and empiricism, that are practiced in our kitchens, as
<lb/>well as in our universities and legislatures.</p><p></p><p>Do I practice what I preach ? Of course I do, and I am
<lb/>never troubled with a disinclination for my dinner. On the
<lb/> contrary, I am sure of one great pleasure every day of my
<lb/> life, let what will happen, for I can hardly conceive of any
<lb/>trouble of sufficient magnitude to make a man in good health,
<lb/>who eats but once a day, forget his dinner. There was one
<lb/> thing to dampen in a degree the pleasure which I anticipated
<lb/> in dining with my friend Bartol. His dinner hour was three
<lb/> o’clock, while my own is invariably five. Therefore my ap-
<lb break="no"/>petite would lack two hours sharpness ; but I obviated this
<lb/>difficulty by eating a lighter dinner the day before. I omitted
<lb/>exactly one fresh roll and a meringue, which balanced very
<lb/> nearly the two hours, for when one o’clock came I felt about
<lb/> the same degree of hunger that I usually do at three.</p><p></p><p>Let me satisfy my friend, the reader, in the outset of my
<lb/>adventures, that I had no mercenary motive in accepting the in-
<lb break="no"/> vitation of Bartol, for I was compelled to buy a white vest, a
<lb/> pair of kid gloves, a linen pocket handkerchief, and a pair of
<lb/> Mack French cassimere pantaloons, the cest of which would
<lb/> have paid for a good many dinners. The truth is, that I very
<lb/> seldom go to a dinner-party, because I have found by experi-
<lb break="no"/>ence that a good dinner is very uncertain, and, therefore, I
<lb/>had not on hand the necessary apparel to appear in on such an
<lb/> occasion. But I had no fear of Bartol; I knew that his dinner
<lb/>would justify me in the expense of an entire suit, although it
<lb/>so happened that my funds were extremely low, and I had neg-
<lb break="no"/>lected to cultivate a credit at any of the tailoring establish-
<lb break="no"/> ments. After I had paid for my new clothes I had just a half</p><p><pb n="386"/>
</p><p>eagle and two shilling pieces in my pocket, and I had no ex-
<lb break="no"/>pectation of getting more until next dividend day, a month off,
<lb/>unless the publisher of a certain Review should keep his
<lb/>promise and pay me for my essay on “ Dinners in the time of
<lb/>the Revolution,” an event which I had no right to hope for,
<lb/>having nothing better than an editor’s word to depend upon.</p><p></p><p>As Bartol lived in the most fashionable extremity of the city
<lb/>I was forced to take a cab, for the streets were dusty as usual,
<lb/>when they are not muddy, and the cab hire was but a trifle
<lb/>compared with the injury which my clothes would receive from
<lb/>the dust. The cabman was a saucy fellow and demanded three
<lb/>shillings, but I had induced him to take me for two, for I was
<lb/>loth to break in upon my half eagle. The fellow drove off
<lb/>pretty briskly until he had got entirely clear of the cab stand,
<lb/>and then he slacked up and let his horse walk.</p><p>“ Come, Sir,” I said, “ this will never do; drive faster.”
“ Are you in a hurry ?" said the cabman.
“ Certainly, I am,” I replied.
</p><p>“Well, I am not,” said the cabman; “ I agreed to take you
<lb/>for two shillings, but I shall take my own time for it; unless
<lb/>you give me another shilling.”</p><p>“I will not give you another penny, you blackguard,” I re-
plied.
</p><p>“Very well,” said he, “here goes then, slow and easy. I
<lb/>like it and so does my hoss, Bossy. Take your time, Mister.”
<lb/>I felt for my watch, and missing it, remembered that I had
<lb/>left it at the watch-maker’s to be cleaned. There was time
<lb/>enough, however, even at the slow pace at which I was going,
<lb/>to reach Bartol’s by three, provided that we made no stops,
<lb/>and I should only miss romping with the children, which I
<lb/>rather preferred doing. Drag; drag; drag; I grew impatient
<lb/>every moment; I caught a glance at a clock in a soda shop,
<lb/>and it lacked ten minutes of three. “ Do have the goodness,
<lb/>my friend,” I said in a subdued voice, “ to drive a little faster.
<lb/>I must get to Marmion-place by three.”</p><p>“ What did you observe ?” said the driver.
“ I observed that you must drive faster, or I shall be too
late for dinner.”
</p><p>“ Whoa ! Whoa,” said the cabman, checking his horse and
<lb/>coming to a dead halt. “ What did you observe, Sir; there is
<lb/>such a noise that I couldn’t hear.”</p><p></p><p>“ You’ll repent of this, you scamp,” said I, “ go a-head.”
<lb/>“What makes you think so, Sir,” he said, looking me in the
<lb/>face ; “perhaps you’ll repent of not paying me my full fare.”</p><p></p><p>I saw there was no use in parleying with the scoundrel, so I
<lb/>swallowed the hard words that were rising in my throat and
<lb/>made him no reply. He whistled, “ Take your time, Miss Lucy,”
<lb/>and put his horse in motion again, but he came to a halt at the
<lb/>corner of fourth street, to let a couple of omnibusses go past
<lb/>that had started on a race from Union Square. I knew it must
<lb/>be three, and I fancied that the soup was put upon the table.</p><p></p><p>I was fast losing all command of myself, but I was determined
<lb/>not to be bullied out of a shilling; the French roll and the
<lb/>meringue were too much for two hours, and my appetite was
<lb/>sharper than usual at five. When a man eats but once in
<lb/>twenty-four hours, it is very essential that his dinner should not
<lb/>be delayed. “ I tell you how it is, Sir,” I said to the cabman in
<lb/>a sharper tone, “ if you do not drive me to Marmion-place in
<lb/>less than five minutes, I will make an example of you, you
<lb/>villain.”</p><p></p><p>“ Who do you call a villain, Mister ?” said the enraged cab-
<lb break="no"/>man jumping from his box. “ I am no villain. I am an honest
<lb/>man. I work for my living; my name is Bunkum. I don’t
<lb/>take that from nobody.”</p><p>On any other occasion I would not have cared a copper for
the fellow. I could have flogged him with ease. But now I
</p><p>could do nothing but run, the passers-by began to gather on
<lb/>the side-walk, and to escape a row I opened the cab door, and
<lb/>jumping out began to walk very briskly towards Marmion-
<lb break="no"/>place, which was but a short distance off. The cabman jump-
<lb break="no"/>ed upon his box again and followed me, crying out, “ pay me
<lb/>my fare, will you, pay me my fare.” At first I said I would
<lb/>not pay him, but not caring to be followed by the rogue to
<lb/>Bartol’s door, I put my hand in my pocket and reached him
<lb/>the two shillings. It was five minutes past three by St. Bar-
<lb break="no"/>tholomew’s clock, but I hurried on and at the corner of Eighth
<lb/>street, encountered a spiral cloud of dust and anthracite ashes,
<lb/>which nearly blinded me, and made my shirt bosom look like
<lb/>a soot bag. I could have cried for vexation if I had not been
<lb/>so hungry; but I shook myself and hurried on, and reached
<lb/>Marmion-place precisely ten minutes past three. I shall cer-
<lb break="no"/>tainly miss the soup, I said to myself, as I glanced up at a
<lb/>bronze door with the name of Bartol emblazoned on a silver
<lb/>plate. If I had known nothing of the owner, I should have
<lb/>said at a glance, “ here lives a giver of good dinners.” The
<lb/>house was one of the best specimens of a city residence that I
<lb/>had ever seen. It had a bit of green sward on one side with
<lb/>a small tree in the centre, the expense of which, was probably
<lb/>greater than an ordinary farm of three or four hundred acres;
<lb/>for in a city land rises in cost as it falls in real value. The
<lb/>house was exactly such a one as I should have expected a man
<lb/>of Bartol’s refinement to build; large and imposing, but with-
<lb break="no"/>out anything that looked like ostentation or a love of show. I
<lb/>was so well satisfied with the exterior, that, bating my appe-
<lb break="no"/>tite, I was impatient to see its interior, and above all, the table.
<lb/>The front blinds were closed, which looked strange, as there
<lb/>was an umbrage screened by a woodbine and trellis-work. I
<lb/>pulled the bell. The door was instantly opened by a black
<lb/>servant, who put up his hand as I stepped upon the door-sill,
<lb/>and said:</p><p>“ Don’t come in, Sir, if you please, their’s a contiguous
disorder in the house.”
“A what!” I exclaimed.
“ A contiguous disease, Sir. Miss Agnes has been took
very ill with the scarlet fever—”
“ Perhaps I have mistaken the house ; is this Mr. Charles
Bartol’s ?”
</p><p>“ Ah ! F,” said Bartol, who came running through the hall.
<lb/>“ My darling little Agnes has broken out with the scarlet fever
<lb/>and we are in a terrible fright. Don’t come in, I am told that
<lb/>it is dangerous to visit when the disease is in a house. Dear
<lb/>little girl! I have not left her bedside a moment since she
<lb/>was taken, for my wife is quite distracted. God help us, but
<lb/>I fear the poor child will not survive. I am every moment
<lb/>expecting a consultation of physicians.” A very faint cough
<lb/>was heard and Bartol darted away without saying another
<lb/>word, and the servant closed the door in my face. A few mo-
<lb break="no"/>ments before the bronze door looked like the gates of Paradise,
<lb/>it now looked as gloomy as Dante’s gates in the Inferno. What
<lb/>was to be done. I tried to think of some friend living in the
<lb/>neighborhood whom I could drop in upon at a family dinner;
<lb/>but I couldn't think of a soul. It was a good mile from any
<lb/>respectable restaurant, and I had neglected to order dinner as
<lb/>usual at my lodgings. I had never in my life been so sharp
<lb/>set before. The vision of Bartol’s dinner which had haunted
<lb/>my imagination for the past twenty-four hours had caused a
<lb/>flood of gastric juice that called for dinner in accents not to
<lb/>be misunderstood.</p><p></p><p>The holy Saint Wulstan confessed that thoughts of dinner
<lb/>had sometimes intruded themselves upon his devotions; and
<lb/>another good .English saint, according to Dr. Southey used
<lb/>often to exclaim—</p><p><pb n="387"/>
“ O belly, belly
You would be gormandizing now I know,
But it shall not be so
Home to your bread and water, home,
I tell ye.”
</p><p>How then could I, who am no saint but a poor sinner, keep
<lb/>my mind free from such thoughts in an extremity like this ? I
<lb/>I turned my back upon the uppish people and with my face
<lb/>towards down-town began to debate in my mind whether it
<lb/>would be better to dine at Delmonico’s, or Blancard’s. I settled
<lb/>upon the latter, because it was the nearest, and not from any
<lb/>preference to its gloomy facade, which looks more like a prison
<lb/>than a salle a manger Granite is a very unsuitable material
<lb/>for an eating-house, unless it were one where Norfolk dump-
<lb break="no"/>lings or some such solids are served up. The white marble
<lb/>Corinthian columns at the entrance of Delmonico’s triangular
<lb/>cafe give a very cheerful and inviting aspect to the house, and,
<lb/>I have no doubt are great promoters of digestion.</p><p></p><p>As I passed by the New York hotel, and heard the tanta-
<lb break="no"/>lizing clatter of knives and plates in the dining-room, I recol-
<lb break="no"/>lected that my friend H. had recently taken up his quarters
<lb/>there, and driven by hunger, I walked into the office of the
<lb/>hotel, and inquired for him, trusting that he might invite me to
<lb/>dine with him. He came to me in a moment with a napkin in
<lb/>his hand, and begged me to wait one minute until he had
<lb/>finished his soup. But he said not a word about my dining
<lb/>with him. In a minute or two, which seemed like an hour to
<lb/>me, he reappeared, saying that he was deuced glad to see me
<lb/>for he was going out of town that afternoon, and had only time
<lb/>to eat a plate of soup for his dinner, and would be eternally
<lb/>obliged to me if I would call upon his partner in the morning
<lb/>and say that he had left his bank-book at the Merchant’s Bank.</p><p></p><p>I am afraid that I did not treat him with much courtesy, for he
<lb/>has never spoken to me since. But politeness in my condition
<lb/>was out of the question. I came out of the hotel and walked
<lb/>very rapidly towards Blancard’s with my eyes averted from 
<lb/>oyster cellars, and baker’s shops, lest I should be tempted into 
<lb/>them and so lose a regular dinner. Arrived at the Globe I
<lb/>entered its heavy looking portal and hurried through the
<lb/>marble hall into the dining room. What a delightful sight! what 
<lb/>an altogether charming and cheering place it is ! A perfect
<lb/>gem of a restaurant. There was but one unoccupied table
<lb/>which I took possession of, and casting my eye over the potages
<lb/>on the Carte du jour, began to feel the most delightful of all titi- 
<lb/>lations. I knew the soups perfectly well by name and I knew
<lb/>also that the julien was particularly good. So I ordered that
<lb/>but first a dozen of Shrewsbury oysters in the shell, with a
<lb/>lemon, then a filet de boeuf au champignons and a meringue 
<lb/>and coffee; wine I never drink when I can get Croton water.
<lb/>This was a very moderate dinner to be sure, but I have already
<lb/>said that I am no glutton; the fresh rolls and the butter are
<lb/>particularly fine at the Globe, and the appointments of the
<lb/>table are so perfect that even so moderate a dinner may be
<lb/>eaten with entire satisfaction. I might have eaten a trifle 
<lb/>more, a croquet or a plate of maccaroni ; but I began mode-
<lb break="no"/>rately. The composure with which I spread my napkin and
<lb/>cut my loaf was really marvellous. The waiter had been
<lb/>gone just three minutes for the oysters, when a person came in
<lb/>and seated himself at the table opposite to me, in whose pre-
<lb break="no"/>sence I could not eat my dinner in peace. It is too long a
<lb/>story, to tell the reasons of my antipathy to him ; he had
<lb/>wronged me in a manner that debarred me from any other satis- 
<lb/>faction than contempt; my dinner, though ordered, had not been
<lb/>touched, and being too much excited in my feelings to make
<lb/>any explanations to the clerk, I rose from the table immedi-
<lb break="no"/>ately and walked out of the house, intending to return the next
<lb/>day and make an apology. Now then, there was no choice,</p><p></p><p>Delmonico’s was the next resource. Here the dinners were
<lb/>quite as good, the carle as extensive, and the prices as low,
<lb/>perhaps lower; but the company was more promiscuous and
<lb/>the finish was not so high. I had always had an objection to
<lb/>the great mirrors in the dining-room, and the monstrous bronze
<lb/>chandeliers, to say nothing of two unceasing harpers who are
<lb/>forever clanging the songs of the last opera, and worse than
<lb/>all the black pepper in square salt cellars. These things more
<lb/>than counterbalanced the white marble pillars ; but I shut my
<lb/>eyes very heroically to all minor defects and entered the coffee
<lb/>room with a determination of repeating the orders that I had
<lb/>given at the Globe. Oysters, potage a la julienne, filet de
<lb/>boeuf au champignons, and a meringue au something. Although
<lb/> I never drink wine, as I have already stated, yet I sometimes
<lb/> drink absynthe very much diluted, and fearing that my long fast
<lb/>would injure my stomach, I stopped at the bar and called for a
<lb/> glass of that bitte stuff, which I drank and put my hand in my
<lb/> pocket, for the half eagle, when, O, horror ! the thought of the
<lb/>thing makes me sick even now, I found only a shilling. I had
<lb/>given my half eagle to that villain cab-man by mistake. My
<lb/>glass of wormwood cost me a shilling, and I had not another
<lb/>copper to bless myself with. What could I do ! A thought
<lb/>struck me ; and a very happy thought it was ; I will order the
<lb/>dinner and go and pawn my watch ; by the time that I get back
<lb/>from Chatham street it will be ready and what a dinner I shall
<lb/>make! I varied the order by the addition of a lobster salad
<lb/>and hurried off. When I reached Chatham street I remem-
<lb break="no"/>bered that ray watch was at the watchmaker’s; never mind
<lb/>that, I had a gold pencil-case, but worse and worse, it was
<lb/> Saturday afternoon and not a pawnbroker’s shop was open,
<lb/>What religious rascals those Jews are. Every moment my
<lb/>appetite was getting sharper and sharper, and I began to think
<lb/>of the “French and English” dining saloons, in Nassau street,
<lb/>where a plate of any thing may be had for a sixpence ; but I
<lb/>hadn't the sixpence even; and Mr. Gosling, in spite of his
<lb/>name is too old a bird to be caught with chaff; I could not des-
<lb break="no"/>cend to ask him to give me credit for a sixpenny dinner ;
<lb/>neither could I return to Delmonico’s and request them to trust
<lb/>me. In passing down Nassau street I encountered the sign of
<lb/>Mons. Napoleon Bunel, restaurateur from Paris. If there is
<lb/>any thing in a name, I thought, this Napoleon among restau-
<lb break="no"/>rateurs must be a grand place for a dinner, and if he has any
<lb/>of the great qualities of his namesake he will not refuse me
<lb/>credit for a filet. Hunger makes its own laws, and I had
<lb/>only to obey its dictates. I made a bold push therefore into
<lb/>the saloon of Mons. Bunel, and was charmed at once by the
<lb/>coup d'oeil Madame B. a jolly looking creature wearing a
<lb/>lace cap and violet ribbons, sat behind the bar, in the character
<lb/>of dame du Comptoir; a large boquet of roses and a box of
<lb/>segars on either side of her. The floor was sanded, which I
<lb/>disliked, it gives one the feeling of dining in the street ; the
<lb/>walls were painted by some unhappy artist who had made ter-
<lb break="no"/>rible work in trying to give a resemblance of trees and green
<lb/>fields, which rather added to the outer-doorishness of the
<lb/>saloon. However, I am never given to fault finding, and I had
<lb/>no disposition to be critical just then ; so I took my seat at one
<lb/>of the marble slabs, and opened the yellow covered carte with
<lb/>a palpitation of the heart. A tall lusty looking garcon in a
<lb/>white jacket stood by me with his ear a little inclined towards
<lb/>ray mouth to catch the first accents of my order. I had set
<lb/>my heart upon potage a la julien and so forth, and I gave the
<lb/>same order that I had given at the Globe and Delmonico’s, with
<lb/>the addition of a fricandeau, and a Charlotte ruse, for
<lb/>my appetite had grown to a boundless craving. Off ran
<lb/>the garcon and I heard the confused sound of deshuits

<lb/>charlotterusevanillecafe as the order was shouted through
<lb/>a tin tube that communicated with the kitchen. I de-
<lb break="no"/>bated with myself one moment whether it would be better to
<lb/>ask Mons. Bunel to give me credit before or after eating the
<lb/>dinner, but I decided at once on the first as being the most
<lb/>honorable, although the latter would be the most certain. Ac-
<lb break="no"/>cordingly I beckoned to Mons. B. who came to me with a smile
<lb/>on his countenance and a spotless napkin on his arm. You
<lb/>have a capital place here, Mons. Bunel, quite a little Rocher ;
<lb/>Mons. bowed. I have ordered a bit of a dinner, some soup
<lb/>and a trifle or two, but I made the oddest mistake just now in
<lb/>giving a cabman a half eagle for a shilling, and I have not got
<lb/>another copper in my pocket and the banks being closed I can-
<lb break="no"/>not get any money before to-morrow. I suppose you will have
<lb/>no objections to giving me credit for my dinner ?</p><p></p><p>Mons. never smiled again, at least in my presence ;—he not
<lb/>only refused to trust me, but he refused to take my gold pencil
<lb/>in pawn; expressing some doubts of its being honestly come
<lb/>by. At that moment the waiter made his appearance with the
<lb/>Shrewsburys and the lemon, but they immediately disappeared
<lb/>again, and I was compelled to make my retreat under the search-
<lb break="no"/>ing eyes of Madame and all the guests at the tables.</p><p></p><p>What must I do ? What could I do ? I was completely at
<lb/>my wit’s end. A happy thought popped into my head. The
<lb/>proprietor of the Franklin coffee-house knew me well. He would
<lb/>trust me of course. I hurried immediately down to his estab-
<lb break="no"/>lishment, and looked at the larder as I passed into the dining-
<lb break="no"/>room. What a magnificent sight his larder is ! Turkies, sad-
<lb break="no"/>dles of mutton, salmon, lobsters, sirloins, rounds of beef, roasting-
<lb break="no"/>pigs, cauliflowers and strawberries. These were a few of the
<lb/>objects that caught my eye, and I determined at once upon a
<lb/>thorough English dinner. Confound your potages and frican-
<lb break="no"/>deaus. I will have, I said, as I walked into this glorious eating-
<lb break="no"/>house, salmon and melted butter, a mug of ale, roast lamb and
<lb/>mint sauce, with potatoes and cauliflowers, then a magnificent
<lb/>slice of roast beef with asparagus, and bread and butter ; then
<lb/>a rhubarb tart and Gloster cheese, and a dish of strawberries
<lb/>and cream. This is one of the most enticing places to a
<lb/>hearty eater that New-York can boast of. Everything about
<lb/>it is solid and substantial,—long marble counters, old mahogany
<lb/>chairs, thick, heavy and comfortable, immense mirrors, pic-
<lb break="no"/>tures of game and sporting scenes ; and then the host himself,
<lb/>bluff, red-faced, bull-necked and hearty, with immense jowls,
<lb/>and a mouth that seems to have been made expressly for
<lb/>eating ; one of those plethoric apertures which one never
<lb/>anticipates any good thing from, notwithstanding that good
<lb/>things are continually going in thereat. Like certain favorites
<lb/>of the public who are in constant receipt of favors, but never
<lb/>make any bestowals in return.</p><p>[To be continued.]

Itself, by itself solely, one everlastingly, and single.
Plato. Sympos.
</p><p>With a feeling of deep yet most singular affection I regarded
<lb/>my friend Morelia. Thrown by accident into her society many
<lb/>years ago, my soul, from our first meeting, burned with fires it
<lb/>had never before known; but the fires were not of Eros , and
<lb/>bitter and tormenting to my spirit was the gradual conviction
<lb/>that I could in no manner define their unusual meaning, or re-
<lb break="no"/>gulate their vague intensity. Yet we met; and fate bound us
<lb/>together at the altar; and I never spoke of passion, nor
<lb/>thought of love. She, however, shunned society, and,attaching
<lb/>herself to me alone, rendered me happy. It is a happiness to
<lb/>wonder ;—it is a happiness to dream.</p><p></p><p>Morelia’s erudition was profound. As I hope to live, her tal-
<lb break="no"/>ents were of no common order—her powers of mind were gi-
<lb break="no"/>gantic. I felt this, and, in many matters, became her pupil. I
<lb/>soon, however, found that, perhaps on account of her Presburg
<lb/>education, she placed before me a number of those mystical
<lb/>writings which are usually considered the mere dross of the
<lb/>early German literature. These, for what reason I could not
<lb/>imagine, were her favorite and constant study—and that, in
<lb/>process of time they became my own, should be attributed to the
<lb/>simple but effectual influence of habit and example.</p><p></p><p>In all this, if I err not, my reason had little to do. My con-
<lb break="no"/>victions, or I forget myself, were in no manner acted upon by
<lb/>the ideal, nor was any tincture of the mysticism which I read,
<lb/>to be discovered, unless I am greatly mistaken, either in my
<lb/>deeds or in my thoughts. Persuaded of this, I abandoned my-
<lb break="no"/>self implicitly to the guidance of my wife, and entered with an
<lb/>unflinching heart into the intricacies of her studies. And then
<lb/>—then, when, pouring over forbidden pages, I felt a forbidden
<lb/>spirit enkindling within me—would Morelia place her cold hand
<lb/>upon my own, and rake up from the ashes of a dead philoso-
<lb break="no"/>phy some low, singular words, whose strange meaning burned
<lb/>themselves in upon my memory. And then, hour after hour,
<lb/>would I linger by her side, and dwell upon the music of her
<lb/>voice—until, at length, its melody was tainted with terror,—and
<lb/>there fell a shadow upon my soul—and I grew pale, and shud-
<lb break="no"/>dered inwardly at those too unearthly tones. And thus, joy
<lb/>suddenly faded into horror, and the most beautiful became the
<lb/>most hideous, as Hinnon became Ge-Henna.</p><p></p><p>It is unnecessary to state the exact character of those disqui-
<lb break="no"/>sitions which, growing out of the volumes I have mentioned,
<lb/>formed, for so long a time, almost the sole conversation of
<lb/>Morelia and myself. By the learned in what might be termed
<lb/>theological morality they will be readily conceived, and by the
<lb/>unlearned they would, at all events, be little understood. The
<lb/>wild Pantheism of Fichte; the modified NaXtyyEVEOia of the
<lb/>Pythagoreans; and, above all, the doctrines of Identity as urg-
<lb break="no"/>ed by Schelling, were generally the points of discussion pre-
<lb break="no"/>senting the most of beauty to the imaginative Morelia. That
<lb/>identity which is termed personal, Mr. Locke, I think, truly de-
<lb break="no"/>fines to consist in the sameness of a rational being. And since
<lb/>by person we understand an intelligent essence having reason,
<lb/>and since there is a consciousness which always accompanies
<lb/>thinking, it is this which makes us all to be that which we call
<lb/>ourselves—thereby distinguishing us from other beings that
<lb/>think, and giving us our personal identity. But the principium
<lb/>individuationis—the notion of that identity which at death is or
<lb/>is not lost forever, was to me—at all times, a consideration of
<lb/>intense interest; not more from the perplexing and exciting na-
<lb break="no"/>ture of its consequences, than from the marked and agitated
<lb/>manner in which Morelia mentioned them.</p><p></p><p>But, indeed, the time had now arrived when the mystery of
<lb/>my wife’s manner oppressed me as a spell. I could no longer
<lb/>bear the touch of her wan fingers, nor the low tone of her mu-
<lb break="no"/>sical language, nor the lustre of her melancholy eyes. And she
<lb/>knew all this, but did not upbraid ; she seemed conscious of
<lb/>my weakness or my folly, and, smiling, called it Fate. She
<lb/>seemed, also, conscious of a cause, to me unknown, for the
<lb/>gradual alienation of my regard ; but she gave me no hint or
<lb/>token of its nature. Yet was she woman, and pined away
<lb/>daily. In time, the crimson spot settled steadily upon the
<lb/>cheek, and the blue veins upon the pale forehead became pro-
<lb break="no"/>minent ; and, one instant, my nature melted into pity, but, in the
<lb/>next, I met the glance of her meaning eyes, and then my soul
<lb/>sickened and became giddy with the giddiness of one who ga-
<lb break="no"/>zes downward into some dreary and unfathomable abyss.</p><p></p><p>Shall I then say that I longed with an earnest and consu-
<lb break="no"/>ming desire for the moment of Morelia’s decease? I did ; but
<lb/>the fragile spirit clung to its tenement of clay for many days—
<lb/>for many weeks and irksome months—until my tortured nerves
<lb/>obtained the mastery over my mind, and I grew furious through
<lb/>delay, and, with the heart of a fiend, cursed the days, and the
<lb/>hours, and the bitter moments, which seemed to lengthen and
<lb/>lengthen as her gentle life declined—like shadows in the dying
<lb/>of the day.</p><p></p><p>But one autumnal evening, when the winds lay still in heav-
<lb break="no"/>en, Morelia called me to her bed-side. There was a dim mist
<lb/>over all the earth, and a warm glow upon the waters, and, amid
<lb/>the rich October leaves of the forest, a rainbow from the firma-
<lb break="no"/>ment had surely fallen.</p><p>“ It is a day of days,” she said, as I approached ; “ a day of
all days either to live or die. It is a fair day for the sons of
<pb n="389"/>
earth an life—ah, more fair for the daughters of heaven and
death!”
I kissed her forehead, and she continued:
“I am dying, yet shall I live.”
“ Morella!”
</p><p>“ The days have never been when thou couldst love me—
<lb/>but her whom in life thou didst abhor, in death thou shalt
<lb/>adore. ”</p><p>“ Morelia !”
</p><p>“I repeat that I am dying. But within me is a pledge of
<lb/>that affection—ah, how little !—which thou didst feel for me,
<lb/>Morelia. And when my spirit departs shall the child live—thy
<lb/>child and mine, Morelia’s. But thy days shall be days of sor-
<lb break="no"/>row—that sorrow which is the most lasting of impressions, as
<lb/>the cypress is the most enduring of trees. For the hours of thy
<lb/>happiness are over; and joy is not gathered twice in a life, as
<lb/>the roses of Paestum twice in a year. Thou shalt no longer,
<lb/>then, play the Teian with time, but, being ignorant of the myr-
<lb break="no"/>tle and the vine, thou shalt bear about with thee thy shroud on
<lb/>earth, as do the Moslemin at Mecca.”</p><p>“Morella!” I cried, “Morella! how knowest thou this ?”—
</p><p>but she turned away her face upon the pillow, and, a slight
<lb/>tremor coming over her limbs, she thus died, and I heard her
<lb/>voice no more.</p><p></p><p>Yet, as she had foretold, her child—to which in dying she
<lb/>had given birth, and which breathed not until the mother breath-
<lb break="no"/>ed no more—her child, a daughter, lived. And she grew
<lb/>strangely in stature and intellect, and was the perfect resemb-
<lb break="no"/>lance of her who had departed, and I loved her with a love more
<lb/>fervent than I had believed it possible to feel for any denizen
<lb/>of earth.</p><p>But, ere long, the heaven of this pure affection became dark-
ened, and gloom, and horror, and grief, swept over it in clouds.
</p><p>I said the child grew strangely in stature and intelligence.—
<lb/>Strange indeed was her rapid increase in bodily size—but ter-
<lb break="no"/>riable, oh ! terrible were the tumultuous thoughts which crowd-
<lb break="no"/>ed upon me while watching the development of her mental be-
<lb break="no"/>ing. Could it be otherwise, when I daily discovered in the
<lb/>conceptions of the child the adult powers and faculties of the
<lb/>woman ?—when the lessons of experience fell from the lips of
<lb/>infancy ? and when the wisdom or the passions of maturity I
<lb/>found hourly gleaming from its full and speculative eye ? When,
<lb/>I say, all this became evident to my appalled senses—when I
<lb/>could no longer hide it from my soul, nor throw it off from those
<lb/>perceptions which trembled to receive it—is it to be wondered
<lb/>at that suspicions, of a nature fearful and exciting, crept in upon
<lb/>my spirit, or that my thoughts fell back aghast upon the wild
<lb/>tales and thrilling theories of the entombed Morelia? I snatch-
<lb break="no"/>ed from the scrutiny of the world a being whom destiny com-
<lb break="no"/>pelled me to adore, and in the rigorous seclusion of my home,
<lb/>watched with an agonizing anxiety over all which concerned
<lb/>the beloved.</p><p></p><p>And, as years rolled away, and I gazed, day after day, upon
<lb/>her holy, and mild, and eloquent face, and poured over her ma-
<lb break="no"/>turing form, day after day did I discover new points of resemb-
<lb break="no"/>lance in the child to her mother, the melancholy and the dead.
<lb/>And, hourly, grew darker these shadows of similitude, and more
<lb/>full, and more definite, and more perplexing, and more hideously
<lb/>terrible in their aspect. For that her smile was like her moth-
<lb break="no"/>er’s I could bear; but then I shuddered at its too perfect identity
<lb/>—that her eyes were like Morella’s I could endure ; but then
<lb/>they too often looked down into the depths of my soul with
<lb/>Morelia’s own intense and bewildering meaning. And in the
<lb/>contour of the high forehead, and in the ringlets of the silken
<lb/>hair, and in the wan fingers which buried themselves therein,
<lb/>and in the sad musical tones of her speech, and above all—oh,
<lb/>above all—in the phrases and expressions of the dead on the
<lb/>lips of the loved and the living, I found food for consuming 
<lb/>thought and horror—for a worm that would not die.</p><p></p><p>Thus passed away two lustra of her life, and, as yet, my
<lb/>daughter remained nameless upon the earth. “ My child” and
<lb/>“ my love” were the designations usually prompted by a father’s
<lb/>affection, and the rigid seclusion of her days precluded all other
<lb/>intercourse. Morella’s name died with her at her death. Of
<lb/>the mother I had never spoken to the daughter;—it was impos-
<lb break="no"/>sible to speak. Indeed, during the brief period of her existence
<lb/>the latter had received no impressions from the outward world
<lb/>save such as might have been afforded by the narrow limits of
<lb/>her privacy. But at length the ceremony of baptism presented
<lb/>to my mind, in its unnerved and agitated condition, a present 
<lb/>deliverance from the terrors of my destiny. And at the baptis-
<lb break="no"/>mal fount I hesitated for a name. And many titles of the wise</p><p></p><p>and beautiful, of old and modern times, of my own and foreign
<lb/>lands, came thronging to my lips, with many, many fair titles of
<lb/>the gentle, and the happy, and the good. What prompted me,
<lb/>then, to disturb the memory of the buried dead ? What demon
<lb/>urged me to breathe that sound, which, in its very recollection
<lb/>was wont to make ebb the purple blood in torrents from the
<lb/>temples to the heart ? What fiend spoke from the recesses of
<lb/>my soul, when, amid those dim aisles, and in the silence of the
<lb/>night, I whispered within the ears of the holy man the syllables
<lb/>—Morella? What more than fiend convulsed the features of
<lb/>my child, and overspread them with hues of death, as starting
<lb/>at that scarcely audible sound, she turned her glassy eyes from
<lb/>the earth to heaven, and, falling prostrate on the black slabs of
<lb/>our ancestral vault, resoonded—“ I am here!”</p><p></p><p>Distinct, coldly, calmly distinct, fell those few simple sounds
<lb/>within my ear, and thence, like molten lead, rolled hissingly into
<lb/>my brain. Years—years may pass away, but the memory of
<lb/>that epoch—never! Nor was I indeed ignorant of the flowers
<lb/>and the vine—but the hemlock and the cypress overshadowed
<lb/>me night and day. And I kept no reckoning of time or place,
<lb/>and the stars of my fate faded from heaven, and therefore the
<lb/>earth grew dark, and its figures passed by me, like flitting shad-
<lb break="no"/>ows, and among them all I beheld only—Morella. The winds
<lb/>of the firmament breathed but one sound within my ears, and
<lb/>the ripples upon the sea murmured evermore—Morelia. But
<lb/>she died; and with my own hands I bore her to the tomb; and I
<lb/>laughed with a long and bitter laugh as I found no traces of the
<lb/>first, in the charnel where I laid the second—Morella.</p><p>_____________________________________________________
</p><p>A Holiday on the Hudson.—Last Monday was a red-
<lb break="no"/>letter day in the lives of four or five hundred happy souls, who
<lb/> made a trip in the new steamer Niagara to West Point.
<lb/>The sun was bright, the breeze fresh, the waters blue, and the
<lb/>new boat for the time was the flower of the river. She
<lb/>should be called the Flor-del-rio. Nothing could be more
<lb/>inappropriate for such a joyous craft than to call her a
<lb/>floating palace. There never was half the light and grace-
<lb break="no"/>ful elegance in any palace that ever was built. The Niagara
<lb/>is a day boat, and her cabin forms one spacious saloon two
<lb/>hundred and seventy feet in length, without any of those
<lb/>stifling encumbrances, called berths, which give to night boats
<lb/>the appearance of soldiers barracks. All the appointments of
<lb/>the boat are quite perfect at a matter of course, and she pre-
<lb break="no"/>sents, in her interior, the appearance of a picture gallery, so
<lb/>profusely are her pannels decorated with prettily executed
<lb/>paintings. Besides a capital band of music on the upper deck,
<lb/>there was piano-forte playing in the ladies cabin ; and several
<lb/>amateur musicians very obligingly sang duets and solos. But
<lb/>even without the music there was no lack of harmony. The
<lb/>boat arrived at West Point about two in the afternoon, and gave
<lb/>an opportunity for a ramble over that romantic and interesting
<lb/>region, to those who were in search of the picturesque; but
<lb/>others availed themselves of a chance to witness an examina-
<lb break="no"/>tion of a class of cadets in chemistry. Among the dignitaries
<lb/>who wore gold lace on the occasion, was Gen. Scott, his big
<lb/>burly figure being considerably increased in its proportions, by
<lb/>epauletts and other gilt appliances. Mr. Weir was also among
<lb/>the examiners, and he sat leaning his head upon his hand, look-
<lb break="no"/>ing very fat and contented. The steamer left the dock at three,
<lb/>and soon after a sumptuous repast was served up, of unusual
<lb/>elegance for a floating palace. A good many bottles of cham-
<lb break="no"/>pagne were emptied, but no toasts or set speeches marred the
<lb/>joyousness of the occasion. Then there were music and sing-
<lb break="no"/>ing again, and afterwards cotillions and the Polka. Before
<lb/>reaching the dock, Mr. Embury of Brooklyn, was put into a
<lb/>velvet rocking-chair and proclaimed chairman of a meeting,
<lb/>which passed some grateful resolutions in which not one half
<lb/>the good nature was expressed that was felt. We remember
<lb/>the last one only, which we are sure everybody else must also
<lb/>remember.</p><p></p><p>“ Resolved., That the Steamer Niagara will be as distinguished in
<lb/>the waters of the east, as the great Cataract whose name she bears
<lb/>is among the waters of the west.”</p><p><pb n="390"/>
</p><p>[The two noble poems subjoined have already appeared in
<lb/>print—although we are unable to say in what work they origi-
<lb break="no"/>nated. They are the composition of one of our most justly
<lb/>distinguished poetesses—Miss Anne Charlotte Lynch. We
<lb/>have no excuse to offer for copying them in the “Journal”—ex-
<lb break="no"/>cept that we have been profoundly impressed with their excel-
<lb break="no"/>lence. In modulation and force of rhythm—in dignity and
<lb/>loftiness of sentiment—and in terse energy of expression—
<lb/>they equal if they do not excel any thing of the same charac-
<lb break="no"/>ter written by an American.—Eds. B. J.]</p><p>THE IDEAL.
“La vie est un somneil, l'amour en est la reve."
A sad, sweet dream! It fell upon my soul
When song and thought first woke their echoes there,
Swaying my spirit to its wild control,
And with the shadow of a fond despair,
Darkening the fountain of my young life’s stream,
It haunts me still and yet I know 'tis but a dream.
</p><p>Whence art thou, shadowy presence, that canst hide
<lb/>From my charmed sight the glorious things of earth ?
<lb/>A mirage o’er life's desert dost thou glide ?</p><p>Or with those glimmerings of a former birth,
A “ trailing cloud of glory,” hast thou come
From some bright world afar, our unremembered home ?
I know thou dwell’st not in this dull, cold Real,
I know thy home is in some brighter sphere,
I know I shall not meet thee, my Ideal,
In the dark wanderings that await me here ;
Why comes thy gentle image then, to me,
Wasting my night of life in one long dream of thee ?
The city’s peopled solitude, the glare
Of festal halls, moonlight, and music’s tone,
All breathe the sad refrain—thou art not there ;
And even with nature I am still alone;
With joy I see her summer bloom depart;
I love stern winter’s reign— ’tis winter in my heart.
And if I sigh upon my brow to see
The deep'ning shadow of Time’s restless wing,
'Tis for the youth I might not give to thee.
The vanished brightness of my first sweet spring;
That I might give thee not the joyous form
Unworn by tears and cares, unblighted by the storm.
And when the hearts I should be proud to win,
Breathe, in those tones that woman holds so dear,
Words of impassioned homage unto mine,
Coldly and harsh they fall upon my ear,
And as I listen to the fervent vow
My weary heart replies, “ Alas, it is not thou !”
Depart, O shadow ! fatal dream, depart!
Go, I conjure thee, leave me this poor life,
And I will meet with firm, heroic heart,
Its threat’ning storms and its tumultuous strife,
And with the poet-seer will see thee stand
To welcome my approach to thine own Spirit-land.
And when the thoughts within my spirit glow
That would out-pour themselves in words of fire,
If some kind influence bade the music flow
Like that which woke the notes of Memnon's lyre,
Thou, sunlight of my life, wak’st not the lay
And song within my heart unuttered dies away.
THE IDEAL FOUND.
</p><p>I’ve met thee, whom I dared not hope to meet
<lb/>Save in th’ enchanted land of my day dreams:
<lb/>Yes, in this common world, this waking state,
<lb/>Thy living presence on my vision beams,</p><p>Life’s dream embodied in reality !
And in thine eyes I read indifference to me !
Yes, in those star-like eyes I read my fate,
My horoscope is written in their gaze:
My “house of life” henceforth is desolate;
But the dark aspect my firm heart surveys.
Nor faints nor falters even for thy sake,—
’Tis calm and nerved and strong—no, no, it shall not break.
For I am of that mood that will defy ;
That does not cower before the gathering storm ;
That face to face will meet its destiny,
And undismayed confront its darkest form.
Wild energies awaken in this strife,
This conflict of the soul with the grim phantom Life.
But ah ! if thou hadst loved me! had I been
All to thy dreams that to mine own thou art.
Had those dark eyes beamed eloquent on mine,
Pressed for one moment to that noble heart
In the full consciousness of faith unspoken,
Life could have given no more—then had my proud heart
broken!
The Alpine glacier from its height may mock
The clouds and lightnings of the winter sky,
And from the tempest and the thunder’s shock
Gather new strength to lift its summit high ;
But kissed by sunbeams of the summer day
It bows its icy crest and weeps itself away.
Thou know’st the fable of the Grecian maid
Wooed by the veiled immortal from the skies,
How in his full perfections, once she prayed,
That he would stand before her longing eyes,
And how that brightness, too intense to bless,
Consumed her o’er-wrought heart with its divine excess.
To me there is a meaning in the tale.
I have not prayed to meet thee; I can brook
That thou shouldst wear to me that icy veil;
I can give back thy cold and careless look ;
Yet shrined within my heart still thou shalt seem,
What there thou ever wert—a beautiful, bright dream !
A JUST VIEW OF A BAD HABIT.
</p><p>We find the following very sensible remarks, in a late num-
<lb break="no"/>ber of the Charleston Mercury, and we copy them to give cur-
<lb break="no"/>rency to such excellent sentiments. But we must resist the
<lb/>imputation of the last sentence. We think that New York is
<lb/>the debtor in this case.</p><p></p><p>A NEW Image oF War.—Among the men of former times, hunt-
<lb break="no"/>ing was termed “ the image of war"—especially the pursuit of
<lb/>wild boars, lions and other ferocious beasts. It had some claim to
<lb/>the distinction. It combined violent exercise, personal peril, the
<lb/>submission to privation and the distinctions, of success, skill and
<lb/>courage. In our day there is enough said about “ campaigns,”
<lb/>“ battles,” "victories,” “ defeats,” “ glory” and all that, to make a
<lb/>stranger think we were engaged incessantly in the business of
<lb/>knocking each other’s brains out—that a bloody and desolating
<lb/>civil war was waged from year’s end to year’s end. What sort of
<lb/>fight and what sort of victory it is, we need not explain. But the
<lb/>dialect is perfectly devilish, and its use is, we are persuaded, of
<lb/>most demoralizing consequence. Those of the opposite party we
<lb/>call the “ enemy when we put them out of office, we call them
<lb/>the “ vanquished,”—and contrary to the laws of modern war, we
<lb/>proceed to treat them as criminals. Dismissing them from office
<lb/>is known by the terms “slaughtering,” " guilatining,” “ cutting off
<lb/>heads,” and simillar bloody-minded phrases.</p><p></p><p>Now aside from the bad taste of using such murderous language,
<lb/>it can hardly fail that this habitual dressing up of our party contests
<lb/>in the phraseology of war and crime, does tend insensibly to em-
<lb break="no"/>bitter them; to deprive the elections of their peaceable character,
<lb/>and to deepen in personal feeling the differences of opinion on pub-
<lb break="no"/>lic measures. In our dialect too, the offices of the country are the
<lb/>" spoil” of the successful party, and they are seized upon as the
<lb/>plunder of the “ enemy.” All this vile phraseology and much of
<lb/>the equally vile practices connected with it, we owe to New York.</p><p><pb n="391"/>
</p><p>Now, who could expect, after reading the above, to find what
<lb/>follows from the pen of the same writer in the same column of
<lb/>the same paper. It will require no very extraordinary gift in 
<lb/>this case, for the Editor of the Mercury to see himself as
<lb/>others see him, if he will be at the trouble of reading both his
<lb/>articles at the same sitting.</p><p></p><p>The South awoke—with one hand she strangled one Presiden-
<lb break="no"/>tial candidate, and with the other, she drew that old sword, (the j
<lb/>proud spirit of the South) before whose keen edge, no foes or party, 
<lb/>since the foundation of the government had ever been able to stand.
<lb/>She triumphed in the Presidential election. The struggle came on ;
<lb/>in Congress. She triumphed again in spite of foes and traitors,
<lb/>South and North. Flushed with her recent victories, there she
<lb/>stands, with stern defiance on her brow, and her yet unsheathed 
<lb/>and dripping sword in her hand. Before heaven! she shall not 
<lb/>sheath it, uutil she is safe, and safe forever. Texas shall be hers,
<lb/>in spite of a world in arms; and to crown her redemption, the
<lb/>fetters of unjust taxation shall be torn from her free limbs. She
<lb/>will no longer endure to be the mock and ribald scoff of fools and
<lb/>fanatics, or the impassive and plundered victim, of mean, venal
<lb/>and dastard monopolists. She will vindicate her rightful station
<lb/>amongst the people of the earth; and whilst fearing none, com-
<lb break="no"/>mand the respect and peace of all.</p><p></p><p>We do not remember ever having seen so much belligerent
<lb/>bluster, and warlike word-spilling as this, in any New York
<lb/>political Journal, even the day before an election. If the ,
<lb/>South is really indebted to New York for her coinage of hot
<lb/>words, she uses them with a degree of liberality that her
<lb/>teacher never indulged in.</p><p>THE HEART OF MAN.
SUGGESTED BY A FRAGMENT OF F. SIELER.
A strange, unsounded, glorious thing,
The heart of man hath ever been,
Where light and gloom alternate spring
With many a changing shade between.
There earnest love and frantic hate
Have their deep fountains, side by side;
There sweetest hopes and feelings mate
With basest fear, with rankling pride.
Like some strong harp whose thousand strings
Vibrate to every passing tone,
Now with deep passion-notes it rings,
Now melts in sorrow’s gentlest moan.
The magic of a kindling eye,
The music of a gentle voice,
May thrill its chords with agony
Or bid its noblest powers rejoice.
A word, a look, a tone, that falls
On memory’s fount, seal'd up for years.
All the bright, glowing past recalls,
Its passionate hopes, its vows, its tears.
Shape after shape of glorious light,
It summons from that living tomb,
With forms whose aspects, once all bright,
Are shadowed now by softest gloom.
The kindling eye, the open brow,
The sunny smile of youth are there;
The faces dimmed by sorrow now,
The hopeless glance of pale despair.
O heart of man ! O heart of man !
What magic of the spirit's lore,
What heav’n-enkindled glance may scan
Thy fountains, hidden evermore 1
No Earthly wisdom may avail;
No eye but His who set the springs
In the heart’s depths, can pierce the veil
That o’er their silent workings clings.

THORWALDSEN’8 STATUE OF BYRON.
</p><p>We copy the annexed account of this interesting work of
<lb/>Art from the London Art-Union, which does not, however,
<lb/>tell the whole story respecting it. The English boast a good
<lb/>deal of their liberality in money affairs, and not without some
<lb/>cause, while the one-string of slander on which they never
<lb/>cease playing, when alluding to this country, is our worship
<lb/>of the almighty dollar. But we do not remember having
<lb/>met with any anecdote of American manners so thoroughly
<lb/>characteristic of a mean and stingy nature as the statement
<lb/>which we find in some of the London papers respecting the
<lb/>monument to Lord Byron.</p><p></p><p>It must be remembered that he was a lord, and his personal
<lb/>friends were among the better classes, in every respect, of
<lb/>English society.</p><p></p><p>It appears that soon after Byron’s death, some of his friends
<lb/>and admirers set about a subscription, for the purpose of plac-
<lb break="no"/>ing a statue to his memory in Westminster Abbey; and
<lb/>when they had gained all the money they could, they offered
<lb/>the amount to Chantrey, and asked him to make the statue.
<lb/>But the sum was so small that he refused to accept it, as he
<lb/>said it would not half pay him for his labor; the admirers of
<lb/>the noble poet applied next to Thorwaldsen, who with great
<lb/>dignity of feeling told them that he could not afford to work
<lb/>for nothing, and he would therefore accept the money, al-
<lb break="no"/>though it was too small to be considered pay, and would give
<lb/>the statue out of respect to the poet, whom he had known
<lb/>personally and loved.</p><p></p><p>Thorwaldsen’s Statue of Lord Byron.—This monument,
<lb/>of which so much has been said and written, will at length find a
<lb/>resting-place in the library of Trinity College, Cambridge, after
<lb/>having remained upwards of twelve years in the cellars of the
<lb/>custom-house, during the whole of which period it has been more
<lb/>or less—as well from its own particular history, as from the great
<lb/>name to which it is dedicated—an object of public solicitude,
<lb/>which of late has increased in consequence of the death of two
<lb/>individuals, the name of one of whom is associated more nearly
<lb/>with it than is usual in his position, while that of the other will be
<lb/>remembered with various feelings in connexion with the monu-
<lb break="no"/>ment of Byron—we mean the decease of the amiable sculptor
<lb/>himself, and of the late Dean of Westminster. An extract of a
<lb/>letter from Stockholm, which appeared in a German paper,
<lb/>among other matters in reference to Thorwaldsen, stated that his
<lb/>executors reclaimed the statue of Byron, and at the same time
<lb/>some improbable statements appeared in our own newspapers in
<lb/>reference to the work. It was hoped that on the death of Dean
<lb/>Ireland the objection to its admission to Westminster Abbey might
<lb/>be set aside, but his successor is on willing to impugn his decision
<lb/>by a reversal. These events have perhaps had the effect of caus-
<lb break="no"/>ing a destination to be determined upon for the work ; at least they
<lb/>have been the means of reviving throughout Europe the circum-
<lb break="no"/>stances of in execution and exclusion from Westminster Abbey.
<lb/>The monument it temporarily deposited in the studio of Sir Rich-
<lb break="no"/>ard Westmacott, and it the property of a body of subscribers,
<lb/>friends and admirers of Byron, by whom the commission was of-
<lb break="no"/>fered to Chantrey, who declined it in consequence of the inade-
<lb break="no"/>quacy of the amount subscribed. It was then proposed to Thor-
<lb break="no"/>waldsen, who at once undertook it, agreeing to receive the sum
<lb/>collected. Many statements have been current as to whether
<lb/>Thorwaldsen did or did not receive remuneration for the work. It
<lb/>is mentioned as a fact that he received the subscription, and set
<lb/>about the monument in admiration of the poet, and in gratitude to
<lb/>his country, for he bore in mind that, while almost despairing, and
<lb/>yet a young artist, he was about to return to bis own country from
<lb/>want of employment in Italy—the first commission he received
<lb/>was from the late Mr. Hope. The statue is life-sized, and repre-
<lb break="no"/>sents the poet seated on the fragment of a rained temple, with his
<lb/>left foot resting on the broken shaft of a column, while on the left,
<lb/>low down, is a skull, and above that the Athenian owl. The
<lb/>head seems to have been worked out from the portrait by Briggs;
<lb/>with the addition of age. In a posthumous work of this kind,
<lb/>had the artist perfectly succeeded, his work had been a miracle of
<lb/>Art: the defects, therefore, are not his, but those of circumstances.
<lb/>The forehead is heavy, and wants the refined modelling which
<lb/>distinguished the head of Byron, nor is the mouth moulded into
<lb/>that expression of which even years could not deprive it; the hands
<lb/>are also somewhat coarse, and by no means worthy of the com-
<lb break="no"/>pliment paid to those of Byron by Ali Pacha. The attire of the
<lb/>figure is a frock-coat,over which is thrown a cloak; in the left</p><p><pb n="892"/>
</p><p>hand is a volume superscribed “ Childe Harold,” and the right
<lb/>holds a pencil or style up to the mouth, as if he were busied in
<lb/>composition. As regards the destination of this statue, it is deep-
<lb break="no"/>ly to be regretted that the monument of Byron has not found a
<lb/>resting-place in the metropolis.</p><p>REVIEWS.
An Essay on the Philosophy of Medical Science, by Elisha
Bartlett, M. D., &amp;c.—Philadelphia, Lea &amp; Blanchard, 1844.
The Principles op the Chrono-thermai. System op Medicine;
with Fallacies of the Faculty. By Samuel Dickinson, M.D., &amp;c.
With introduction and notes, by William Turner, M. D., &amp;c.—
New-York, J. S. Redfield, Clinton Hall, 1845.
</p><p>These are two books diametrically opposite in their aims,
<lb/>yet both significant signs in the Medical World; it is on this
<lb/>account that we bring them together, that we may expound
<lb/>their meaning, for the benefit of our readers who happen to
<lb/>be uninitiated in the mysteries of Esculapius’ worship. Dr.
<lb/>Bartlett, by way of preliminaries to dispose the good-natured
<lb/>reader to a favorable judgment of his cause, devotes a few
<lb/>chapters of his book to demonstrating what constitutes a correct
<lb/>mode of observing and reasoning, or, in one word, of philoso-
<lb break="no"/>phizing in exact sciences ; and having thus built a ladder, to
<lb/>step upon, he drags his reader up the heights of Medical science,
<lb/>showing him all the while, how firmly and securely, and how
<lb/>philosophically he ascends to the possible in the knowledge of
<lb/>the healing art. Doubtless, the unsuspecting, and not very
<lb/>keen-sighted reader, will believe, on laying down Dr. Bart-
<lb break="no"/>lett’s book, that he has drank deeply at the very source of truth.
<lb/>But for ourselves who have dabbled in those matters upon
<lb/>which the learned doctor is so eloquent, we can declare that
<lb/>we rose from the intellectual repast which the doctor cooked
<lb/>up, with a hungry stomach, for the quantity we have con-
<lb break="no"/>sumed proved but a few grains of truth in a bushel of chaff.
<lb/>Yet, we are free to confess that the doctor is an excellent cook
<lb/>in his way, indeed, there are not many such in his profession.
<lb/>There is both mechanical and intellectual legerdemain,the doc-
<lb break="no"/>tor’s work is an evidence of the latter; he is a schoolman who
<lb/>has learned to muster his words in a phalanx, as a drill-ser-
<lb break="no"/>geant does his men, but without the aid of scholastic glasses he
<lb/>is incapable of looking upon nature, and marking her workings.
<lb/>The aim of the book is to teach how to philosophize in medi-
<lb break="no"/>cine, but it strikes us, taking the doctrines he favors as an
<lb/>evidence, that he has not learnt the art himself; for he talks
<lb/>grandiloquently of such nonsense as a correct nosology, the
<lb/>bug-bear of inflammation, and believes in the means of reduc-
<lb break="no"/>ing it by bleeding—things that have a foundation only in the
<lb/>brains of professors and their dupes, but not in nature. He
<lb/>condemns hypotheses, but insists that naked facts should make
<lb/>up the science. He forgets that it is as easy for those who are
<lb/>not fit for the task, and these are numerous, to make wrong
<lb/>experiments, and call them naked facts, as it is for another set
<lb/>of persons equally unfit for their undertaking, to make incor-
<lb break="no"/>rect hypotheses and call them true explanations of nature's
<lb/>mysteries. The alchemists have collected numerous so-called
<lb/>facts, but they did not know what to make of them, for they
<lb/>experimented foolishly, and they might have gone on still
<lb/>longer putting wrong questions to nature, and remain as igno-
<lb break="no"/>rant as ever. It was left for the intellect of Lavoisier, Guy
<lb/>Lussac and others, who could at a glance surmise correctly
<lb/>nature's purposes, to question her accordingly; and thus they
<lb/>were enabled to raise the structure of exact sciences.</p><p></p><p>The fact is, that it is permitted but to few to make correct
<lb/>hypotheses and have them verified by experience ; but those
<lb/>few cannot teach others to do the same ; nor will they stop to
<lb/>give us an account of the mental processes that led them to
<lb/>their discoveries. There is a larger class of minds that, when</p><p></p><p>discoveries are made and interpreted, can logically, step by
<lb/>step, verify and enlarge the experience of others, but who
<lb/>would never discover anything themselves ; and there is ano-
<lb break="no"/>ther class of men still more numerous, who can write upon
<lb/>the correct manner of making discoveries, and collecting facts :
<lb/>but yet these last are not the persons to be employed for the
<lb/>purposes of the art they teach ; they are mere self-satisfied
<lb/>and self-glorifying schoolmen. Dr. Bartlett’s book sufficiently
<lb/>justifies us in making the above observations ; his aim seems
<lb/>to have been to raise the credit of the old school of medicine,
<lb/>which of late, has lost so much in public estimation. With
<lb/>those who cannot see for themselves, he will undoubtedly suc-
<lb break="no"/>ceed ; but there will be yet a few left, cunning enough to see
<lb/>through the legerdemain of his logic, and who will persist in
<lb/>mistrusting the learning of the faculty. The author of this
<lb/>book is a striking illustration of that calibre of mind that can
<lb/>spend itself in petty details with great gusto and considerable
<lb/>credit; but is incapable by summing them up, to rise to gene-
<lb break="no"/>ralities, and seize upon the secrets of nature. Unfortunately for
<lb/>mankind, we had too many such men in the profession, and it
<lb/>is they especially, more even than the intrinsic difficulty of the
<lb/>subject, who contributed so much to swell the lumbering trash
<lb/>of medical libraries. Yes, it is these men of details, and of
<lb/>specialities, who split a hair with the greatest delicacy, who
<lb/>mole-like cannot see beyond the mole-cast they make, that
<lb/>give force to Condillac’s saying when applied to medicine,
<lb/>“ that man never has so much to say of a subject, as when he
<lb/>knows the least of it.” A different spirit we find in Dr.
<lb/>Dickinson’s lectures. In commencing his observations, he
<lb/>was fully impressed with the idea that details, different as they
<lb/>may appear, merge in each other, that they may be lost in
<lb/>unity,—this being an all-pervading law of nature ; and so his
<lb/>results are as grand as they are just in conception. We can
<lb/>speak here, with the assurance of personal experience, for in
<lb/>our own studies we have come to similar though not identical
<lb/>results, long before we ever heard of the Fallacies of the Fa-
<lb break="no"/>culty. His views may be briefly stated to consist in unity of
<lb/>disease, in variety of symptoms, the intermittent fever being
<lb/>the type of all the suffering that flesh is heir to. The nervous
<lb/>system in general, and the brain in particular, is the citadel
<lb/>from which life issues, and which disease assails. An equili-
<lb break="no"/>brium of temperature throughout the body is, in his opinion,
<lb/>absolutely essential to health ; and any derangement of if,
<lb/>causes as well as accompanies disease; the evident indication
<lb/>in the cure therefore is, to restore it to its due degree by appro-
<lb break="no"/>priate appliances. Thus periodicity of recurrence of disease
<lb/>and variability of temperature are the landmarks by which the
<lb/>physician is to be guided in his treatment.</p><p></p><p>The doctor advocates his views with great force of reasoning
<lb/>and abundance of wit and fancy ; so much so, that the book
<lb/>is exceedingly attractive even to an unprofessional reader.
<lb/>With unsparing severity he points out many of the learned
<lb/>follies of the faculty, and with the most satisfactory proof he
<lb/>confutes the unphilosophical and murderous practice of blood-
<lb break="no"/>letting in all its forms.</p><p></p><p>Much as we admire the common-sense views of Dr. Dickin-
<lb break="no"/>son, yet we are not entirely satisfied with him, for he has over-
<lb break="no"/>looked some things and underrated others. His views do not
<lb/>enable us to look upon the economy of the human system, as
<lb/>complete in all points; perhaps he gives us only what he sees
<lb/>himself, and what is the most essential in the removal of dis-
<lb break="no"/>eases. Be it as it may, he deserves our gratitude for what he has
<lb/>done. It requires great moral courage to speak against the
<lb/>follies of mis-called science, and especially among the most con-
<lb break="no"/>servative of all classes of men. Medicine never will be thor-</p><p><pb n="393" break="no" />
</p><p>oughly reformed till men of common sense and decided talent,
<lb/>whose minds are stored with a variety of information, bring their
<lb/>ability to bear upon medical practices and theories, with no oth-
<lb break="no"/>er aim than to advance Truth. The love of professional lucre
<lb/>too often stands in the way of truth—and it is asking too much
<lb/>from human nature to expect immolation of self on the altar of
<lb/>truth, at the hands of the medical profession—and especially
<lb/>when it is so crowded that a cunning dunce often stands a bet-
<lb break="no"/>ter chance of success than a man of modest talent and upright-
<lb break="no"/>ness. It should be impressed upon the minds of men that what
<lb/>was said of poets is applicable to physicians with double force:
<lb/>Physicians are born, not made. Many who have received their
<lb/>doctorate find on their coming into the daylight of experi-
<lb break="no"/>ence, that instead of the doctor’s they have been crowned with
<lb/>the fool’s-cap.</p><p></p><p>Looking upon the state of the medical profession in these times,
<lb/>we cannot but see omens of great good to come. It is so divid-
<lb break="no"/>ed by different sects holding more or less correct views, that
<lb/>each must modify the other; and here and there a brave oppo-
<lb break="no"/>nent arises who challenges them all; and a suspicious public
<lb/>begins to be aroused from its stupidity, and thinks that
<lb/>the evil is not in her body, but in that of the doctors—all this
<lb/>ferment of opinion may clarify man's judgment upon the subject,
<lb/>and some genius may arise who will select the truth that gives
<lb/>partial currency to the pretensions of each system, and ren-
<lb break="no"/>der a lasting benefit to mankind. Perhaps his name may be An-
<lb break="no"/>drew Sniadecki, who some time ago developed his theory of organ-
<lb break="no"/>ic beings, and whose death Poland was made too soon to lament,
<lb/>or he upon whomever his cloak has fallen. We mention the dis-
<lb break="no"/>tinguished Pole, because in the whole range of our medical read-
<lb break="no"/>ing, we find none who applies, in a more simple and beautiful
<lb/>diction, such a rigorous method of reasoning to such a vast fund
<lb/>of information; so much so that medicine in his hands almost
<lb/>becomes one of the exact sciences.</p><p></p><p>PLATO CONTRA ATHEOS.—Plato against the Atheists; or the Tenth
<lb/>Book of the Dialogue on Laws, accompanied with Critical Notes,
<lb/>and followed by Extended Dissertations on some of the Main
<lb/>Points of the Platonic Philosophy and Theology, especially as
<lb/>compared with the Holy Scriptures, by Tayler Lewis, LL. D.,
<lb/>Professor of the Greek Language and Literature, in the Univer-
<lb break="no"/>sity in the city of New York.—New York, Harper &amp; Brothers.</p><p></p><p>The Laws of Plato were probably the work of his old age
<lb/>—of his extreme senility—and although Dr. Lewis insists
<lb/>upon this point, as one tending to make us think more favora-
<lb break="no"/>bly of the composition, on the ground of its embodying the
<lb/>philosopher’s most matured and best settled opinions—we can-
<lb break="no"/>not help regarding the question as disputable. As a dramatic
<lb/>work, all admit it to be inferior to the Republic. There are
<lb/>but three interlocutors—Clinias, a Cretan; Megillus, a Spar-
<lb break="no"/>tan ; and a stranger, who is spoken of only as the Athenian
<lb/>—but, who is the Socrates of the colloquy; the two first, be-
<lb break="no"/>ing merely listeners, or speaking but for the purpose of foils.
<lb/>The nine first books are occupied with legislative schemes
<lb/>given at length, with preambles, and arguments in support of
<lb/>both preambles and schemes. The tenth book (now published)
<lb/>deals with laws enacted against violators of religion—that is
<lb/>to say, public worship—it being taken for granted that State
<lb/>and Church can never properly exist apart. The greater por-
<lb break="no"/>tion—indeed nearly the whole of the book, however, is taken
<lb/>up with an exordium, investigating the reasons for the laws— 
<lb/>the latter in fact occupying only a few of the concluding
<lb/>pages.</p><p></p><p>The argument is directed first, against those who deny the
<lb/>Divine existence—secondly, against those who deny a Provi-
<lb break="no"/>dence while admitting the existence of a God—thirdly, against
<lb/>those who, admitting both, yet maintain that the Deity is easily
<lb/>propitiated by sinners.</p><p></p><p>Clinias opens the first branch of this argument, by asserting
<lb/>that the existence of God is readily shown by the universality
<lb/>of man’s belief in his existence, as well as by the evidences
<lb/>of design in natural phenomena.</p><p></p><p>This ease of demonstration the Athenian denies ; declaring,
<lb/>however, that whatever difficulty there is, is not innate in the
<lb/>subject, but springs from the perverseness of the Ionic Atheists
<lb/>in imposing upon the world the ideas of chance, nature, art,
<lb/>etc., and in the refutation of these ideas the reasoner discusses
<lb/>at length the nature of soul as involving, necessarily, self-
<lb break="no"/>motion. Thence, he deduces the priority in time of soul to
<lb/>body—thence, again, of the properties of soul to the proper-
<lb break="no"/>ties of body. The inference is, that Art is the mother of Nature
<lb/>—that law, will, thought, or design, must have been before
<lb/>qualities, such as hardness, weight—etc, etc.</p><p></p><p>The intention here is to refute the particular opinion of the
<lb/>Atheist, that religion had no better foundation than conventi-
<lb break="no"/>onality, since belief in the existence of God is the production
<lb/>of human law—which, again, is a product of Art—Art itself
<lb/>being regarded as the offspring of Nature.</p><p></p><p>The question of motion is examined very minutely—and all
<lb/>kinds of motion are divided into motion by impulse, and, that
<lb/>which moves something else by commencing motion in itself;
<lb/>the latter species being psyche, or soul.</p><p></p><p>In the next place, occurs the question whether one or more
<lb/>souls are at work in the Universe. It is decided that there
<lb/>are two—the soul of good and the soul of evil.</p><p></p><p>The second grand division of the subject is the investiga-
<lb break="no"/>tion of the arguments which deny a Providence. The Athe-
<lb break="no"/>nian maintains a minute, special interference with human af-
<lb break="no"/>fairs, chiefly on the ground that the whole is composed of its</p><p>parts, and that to neglect the smallest portion is to neglect the
whole.
</p><p>In entering the third division of his theme, the speaker op-
<lb break="no"/>poses the arguments of those who maintain that the Deity is
<lb/>easily appeased, by adverting to the pre-supposed antagonism
<lb/>between good and evil. Where a conflict is continually going
<lb/>on, he says, the least neutrality or supineness—that is to say,
<lb/>the least mercy shown to sin, would be treason against the
<lb/>cause of the Right throughout the Universe.</p><p></p><p>The offenders against religion are divided into six classes,
<lb/>or rather grades. The book ends with a specification of pen-
<lb break="no"/>alties, and a law, in especial against private rites and churches.</p><p></p><p>Such is a fair, although very succinct synopsis of a work
<lb/> comparatively little known, although very frequently made the
<lb/>subject of converse.</p><p></p><p>No one can doubt the purity and nobility of the Platonian
<lb/>soul, or the ingenuity of the Platonian intellect. But if the
<lb/>question be put to-day, what is the value of the Platonian
<lb/>philosophy, the proper answer is—“ exactly nothing at all."
<lb/>We do not believe that any good purpose is answered by popu-
<lb break="no"/>larizing his dreams ; on the contrary we do believe that they
<lb/>have a strong tendency to ill—intellectually of course.</p><p></p><p>We could wish that Dr. Lewis (however excusable may be
<lb/>his evident enthusiasm for his favorite) had less frequently in-
<lb break="no"/>terspersed his comments with such passages as the following :</p><p></p><p>“ Then surely should Plato be studied, if for no other purpose, as a
<lb/>matter of curiosity, to see if there may not possibly bo some other philo-
<lb break="no"/>sophy than this noisy Baconianism about which there is kept UP
<lb/>such AN EverlASTING DIN, or that still more noisy because more empty
<lb/> transcendentalism which some would present as its only antidote.</p><p></p><p>* * * * Especially will this be the case at a time when physical
<lb/>science, in league with a subtle pantheism, is everywhere substituting
<lb/>its jargon of laws and elements, nebular star-dust, and vital forces,
<lb/>and magnetic fluids, for the recognition of a personal God and an ever
<lb/>wakeful, ever energizing special Providence.”</p><p></p><p>For our own parts we vastly prefer even the noise of Bacon,
<lb/>the laws of Combe, or the nebular star-dust of Nichols to
<lb/>what Dr. Lewis will insist upon terming " the clear, simple,</p><p><pb n="394"/>
</p><p>common-sense philosophy of Plato,”—but these things are
<lb/>perhaps merely matters of taste. It would be as well, how-
<lb break="no"/>ever, to bear in mind the aphoristic sentence of Leibnitz—“ La
<lb/>plupart des sectes ont raison en beaucoup de ce qu'lles avan-
<lb break="no"/>cent, mais non pas en ce qu'elles nient."</p><p></p><p>We regret that it has been thought advisable to give the
<lb/>Greek text unaccompanied with a translation. The object, so
<lb/>far as we can comprehend the annotator, seems to have been
<lb/>the placing of the doctrines of Plato more immediately with-
<lb break="no"/>in the reach of the public. For this end we should have had
<lb/>a paraphrase, at least.</p><p></p><p>Harper's illuminated and Illustrated Edition of Shakes-
<lb break="no"/>peare. Nos. 55 &amp; 56 : Containing parts of “ As You Like It,”
<lb/>and “ Midsummer Night’s Dream.” Price 25cts.</p><p></p><p>We have already expressed a favorable opinion of this truly
<lb/>beautiful edition of Shakespeare ; but the present issue comes to
<lb/>us with so liberal an enrichment of wood cuts, that we cannot
<lb/>refrain from expressing once more our opinion of its cheapness
<lb/>and beauty. Here are twenty-nine spirited wood cuts, from
<lb/>good designs, printed with great clearness and beauty in ink of
<lb/>unusual brilliancy and on fine paper, accompanying a play by
<lb/>Shakespeare, and sold for the inconsiderable price of 25 cents.
<lb/>The cover to this edition of Shakespeare is a very handsome de-
<lb break="no"/>sign by Catherwood, a thousand times superior to the hideous
<lb/>thing designed by R. W. Weir, N. A. A more thoroughly
<lb/>contemptible affair, exhibiting not only an utter poverty of imag-
<lb break="no"/>ination, but the most meagre acquirements in art, was never
<lb/>put off upon the public, than the cover which was first published
<lb/>by Mr. Hewitt, when this edition of Shakespeare was issued
<lb/>by him. Thanks to the liberality and discernment of the
<lb/>present publishers, we are no longer annoyed by the appa-
<lb break="no"/>rition of the Weir sisters, and the figure of Shakespeare in a
<lb/>canoe, on the cover of these plays. It is a disgrace to Ameri-
<lb break="no"/>can Art, that we have never been able to produce the shadow of
<lb/>an ornamental design, and nothing can more plainly prove the
<lb/>entire inadequacy of the system of instruction adopted by our
<lb/>National Academy than the wretched abortions which the artists
<lb/>who write N. A. at the end of their names, have produced in
<lb/>their attempts at ornamental drawings. They prove beyond a
<lb/>question that they have not been grounded in the A. B. C. of
<lb/>art. Now that the academy has got an artist for its President,
<lb/>we have hopes that something better may be produced.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Verplanck is doubtless very competent to edit Shakes-
<lb break="no"/>peare, but we have noticed some very strange readings in one
<lb/>or two of the earlier issues of the edition, which must have been
<lb/>owing either to gross carelessness, or something worse.</p><p>We take a few passages only for example. Where it is mate-
rial, we point according to copy,
“ Is execution done on Cawdor: or not
Those in commission yet return'd ?"
This should be:
Is execution done on Cawdor ? Are not
Those in commission yet return’d ?
“ Send forth great largess to your offices,”
Should be:
Send forth great largess to your officers.
“ We would spend it in some words upon that business,”
Should be:
Would spend it in some words upon that business [Without the
“ We”—Macbeth was not then king.]
“ The curtain’d sleep,”
Should be:
The curtain'd sleeper.
“ Thy very stones,”
We think should be:
The very stones.
“ And all-thing unbecoming,”
Should be:
And all things unbecoming.
" To be thus is nothing,
But to be safely thus
A more weighty point than a comma is wanted after “ noth-
ing.”
“ To make them kings, the seeds of Banquo kings !”
Same after “ kings”—and “ seeds” should be seed.
“ Now, go to the door,”
Should be:
Now to the door.
“ To pray for this good man,”
Should be:
To pray for that good man.
" Whom we to gain our peace, have sent to peace,”
Should be:
Whom we, to gain our place, have sent to peace.
—“ the feast is sold,
That is not often vouch’d while 'tis a making ;
'Tis given with welcome.”
</p><p>A comma after “ vouch’d” and another after “ making,” in
<lb/>the room of the semicolon there, would have given the true read-
<lb break="no"/>ing—which is turned into nonsense by the false pointing in this
<lb/>new edition.</p><p>“ If trembling I inhabit then,”
Should be:
If trembling I inhibit then.
“ tell me if your art
Can tell so much)
Where is the other mark of the parenthesis ?
“ and with him,
To leave no rubs nor blotches in the work,)
Where is the other mark of this parenthesis ?
</p><p>But this is painful work: we will therefore end it, for the pres-
<lb break="no"/>ent, by a short notice of something that, in itself, is enough to
<lb/>injure the whole edition in which it occurs,—we mean, in the
<lb/>opinion of Shakespeare’s “lovers.”</p><p></p><p>The play is Twelth Night. In the first interview between
<lb/>Olivia and Viola, Olivia, after Viola has said, “ Good madam,
<lb/>let me see your face,” is made to reply, “ Have you any com-
<lb break="no"/>mission from your lord to negociate with my face ? You are
<lb/>now out of your text: but we will draw the curtain, and show
<lb/>you the picture. Look you, sir; such a one I was this present:
<lb/>is’t not well done !” [Unveiling.]</p><p>Now, which looks most like Shakespeare, that, or this :
“ Look you, 8ir: 8ucb a one as I was, this presents.
Is’t not well done ?”—[ Unveiling. ]
The word “ as,” the comma after “ was,” and the addition-
al s to the word “ present,” make all the difference.
A Pilgrimage to Treves, through the Valley of the Meuse and
the Forest of Ardennes in the year 1844. Harper &amp; Brothers,
1845.
</p><p>We have here another new book from the pen of an American,
<lb/>and a very modest and entertaining one it is. The author, a
<lb/>son of the Rev. Dr. Anthon of this city, says that, having de-
<lb break="no"/>termined to “ attempt the production of a book," he took up his
<lb/>residence in Spa to carry on its manufacture, for three sensible
<lb/>reasons; first because it is a pleasant place to live in ; secondly
<lb/>because it is a fashionable watering place which being deserted
<lb/>at that time afforded him excellent accommodations ; and
<lb/>thirdly because it is in the vicinity of Liege and Brussels, from
<lb/>which cities he could obtain all the books of which he stood in
<lb/>need. We like this manner of producing a book, and we only
<lb/>regret that all authors cannot, like Mr. Anthon, select their
<lb/>cities of refuge when the fit of production comes over them.
<lb/>But there have been many books produced in garrets and
<lb/>prisons and other places very far from being pleasant, which</p><p><pb n="395"/>
</p><p>will be read with delight, and have power to make any place
<lb/>pleasant when the “ Pilgrimage to Treves” will have been
<lb/>utterly forgotten.</p><p></p><p>We do not mean to underrate Mr. Anthon’s work because
<lb/>it was produced under circumstances so exceedingly agreeable.
<lb/>There are but few young gentlemen of his years and opportu-
<lb break="no"/>nities who ever think of producing a book at all, or if they
<lb/>should make the attempt, would succeed as well as he has
<lb/>done.</p><p></p><p>The author begins his book with Charlemagne and Aix-la-
<lb break="no"/>Chapelle and serves up anew several bits of history which do
<lb/>not possess much novelty to recommend them. The “ Pil-
<lb break="no"/>grimage” is not commenced until we reach the middle of the
<lb/>book, when the interest of the work begins. The author set
<lb/>out from Dinant on the 4th of September to join the pilgrims
<lb/>who were flocking in immense numbers to Treves to witness
<lb/>the exhibition of the sacred robe of Christ which happens to
<lb/>be in possession of the church of that city. Mr. Anthon in-
<lb break="no"/>forms us, however, that he does not himself attach any impor-
<lb break="no"/>tance to relics, and very conclusively argues that the chances
<lb/>are a considerable many to nothing that Christ never had the
<lb/>sacred robe of Treves on his back.</p><p></p><p>In some of his descriptions he is sufficiently exact, but in
<lb/>others he is exceedingly vague and uncertain : for instance, in
<lb/>speaking of Hardenne, a seat of the King of the Belgians, he
<lb/>says it is “ furnished in a style of simple elegance,” which
<lb/>must be interpreted according to the reader’s own ideas of
<lb/>what constitutes simple elegance. Probably some readers if
<lb/>made acquainted with the realities of Hardenne would say
<lb/>that it was furnished in a style of the most superb and thrill-
<lb break="no"/>ing magnificence, for we saw in one of our morning papers, a
<lb/>day or two since, an allusion to a new Broadway Omnibus
<lb/>which was styled “ a truly palacial carriage,” and every news-
<lb break="no"/>paper reader know's that all the steamboats in our waters are
<lb/>“ floating palaces.”</p><p></p><p>The sacred tunic was presented to Treves by the Empress
<lb/>Helena, she having procured it in Palestine three hundred
<lb/>years after the crucifixion.</p><p></p><p>"Since the exposition which took place in the year 1512, the
<lb/>Tunic has been publicly displayed nine times, seven times a
<lb/>Treves and twice at Ehrenbreitstein, to which place it bad been
<lb/>transported on account of the risk of destruction or plunder to
<lb/>which it was exposed during the war which distracted Germany
<lb/>The last exposition occurred in 1810, and lasted 19 days. The
<lb/>number of strangers who visited Treves during this time am-
<lb break="no"/>ounted to 227,000. According to the belief of some, miracu-
<lb break="no"/>lous cures were wrought by the sight and touch of the relic. I is
<lb/>said that many paralytics, and other persons so sick or infirm that
<lb/>they had to be carried before it, afterward walked without as-
<lb break="no"/>sistance.</p><p></p><p> Those who dread the predominance of the Roman Catholic
<lb/>faith, and look with anxiety on the signs which seem to indicate
<lb/>that she is about to resume much of her ancient dominion, will be
<lb/>struck by the fact that the exposition of the sacred Robe in the
<lb/>year 1844 has attracted a greater host of pilgrims than on any pre-
<lb break="no"/>vious occasion. The number of strangers who visited Treves from
<lb/>the 17th of August to the 6th of October amounted to upward of
<lb/>450,000 !"</p><p>The sacred robe is deposited in a chamber of the Cathedral,
where it is kept except on occasions of exhibition.
</p><p>"The crowd of pilgrims entering the great portal on the right
<lb/>in regular procession, two and two, reached the central nave
<lb/>where they separated into two files, one on each side of it. Ad
<lb/>vancing in this order, marshalled by officers with scarfs of red and
<lb/>yellow, the colours of Treves, they travelled the whole length of
<lb/>the choir, and arrived at its upper end, where the two files again
<lb/>united at the foot of an elevated platform of variegated marble, as-
<lb break="no"/>cended on each side by a broad flight of steps, and decorated for
<lb/>the occasion with flowering plants. In the centre of this platform
<lb/>directly in front of the treasure chamber, from which it had been
<lb/>taken, was displayed the revered object of their pilgrimage, spread
<lb/>out on a glass case, and decked with white satin and blue drapery
<lb/>trimmed with gold. The people mounted the platform by the
<lb/>right-hand staircase, and passed in front of the relic, where they
<lb/>were permitted to pause for an instant, while they gave to one of</p><p></p><p>the attending priests some small object, such as a medal, a rosary,
<lb/>or a representation of the Robe, embroidered on silk, or engraved
<lb/>on paper. The priest touched these to the Tunic, and having
<lb/>thus, in the opinion of the orthodox, extracted some of its virtues
<lb/>restored them to their owners, who then descended the flight of
<lb/>steps on the left, and quitted the Cathedral by a side door. Upon
<lb/>a table were seen the offerings of the pilgrims, an immense pile of
<lb/>copper coins, testifying at once to the multitude of the donors and
<lb/>to their individual poverty.	</p><p></p><p>I am not ashamed to confess that, as I stood upon this elevation,
<lb/>and surveyed the whole scene which was passing, I felt deeply
<lb/>moved. The spectacle which the interior of that venerable edi-
<lb break="no"/>fice then presented might indeed excuse a moment’s credulity.
<lb/>On one side the pilgrims were pressing forward with faces of
<lb/>eager expectation, chastened by religious awe, while the solemn
<lb/>melody of the organ conspired to elevate the thoughts all from
<lb/>earth; and as they descended, it was easy to read on their coun-
<lb break="no"/>tenances the joy and gratitude with which they were filled.</p><p></p><p>The Roman Catholics seize eagerly on examples of the emotion
<lb/>which so impressive a ceremony can hardly fail to excite, as proofs
<lb/>of a peculiar and divine influence which the relic exerts on the
<lb/>stubborn hearts of heretics. A chronicler of the exposition relates,
<lb/>for instance, with considerable naivete, that an Israelitish woman,
<lb/>on seeing it, burst into tears, and immediately made an offering of
<lb/>four thalers, which, in his opinion, is a very strong testimony to
<lb/>the authenticity and virtue of the Robe.”</p><p>There are a few more pages, but properly, the pilgrimage
ends here.
NEW WORKS LATELY RECEIVED.
</p><p>Satanstoe, or the Littlepage Manuscripts. A Tale of the Colony:
<lb/>by J. Fennimore Cooper. In 2 vols. New-York: Burgess,
<lb/>Stringer &amp; Co.</p><p></p><p>Satanstoe appears to be the first of a series of three tales
<lb/>written to illustrate a principle, the principle of anti-rentism,
<lb/>which Mr. Cooper considers a greater disgrace to the State of
<lb/>New-York than repudiation to Mississippi. We have but lit-
<lb break="no"/>tle faith in stories that are written to illustrate any other prin-
<lb break="no"/>ciple than the principle of human nature, and we doubt wheth-
<lb break="no"/>er Satanstoe will be read with much interest by any class ex-
<lb break="no"/>cepting those who have read the author’s other productions, for
<lb/>the sake of the story. It appears that Satanstoe is a neck of
<lb/>land somewhere in Westchester county, its precise locality we
<lb/>are not acquainted with, but it is probably in the neighborhood
<lb/>of Devilshoof. Of the merits of the work we are unable to
<lb/>speak at present. We give the concluding paragraph of the
<lb/>author’s preface, for the sake of its manly tone, which wil
<lb/>neet with a hearty response from all honest men.</p><p></p><p>" For ourselves, we conceive that true patriotism consists in
<lb/>laying bare every thing like public vice, and in calling things
<lb/>by their right names. The great enemy of the race has made
<lb/>a deep inroad upon us, within the list ten or a dozen years,
<lb/>under cover of a spurious delicacy on the subject of expressing
<lb/>national ills ; and it is time that they who have not been afraid
<lb/>to praise when praise was merited, should not shrink from the
<lb/>office of censuring, when the want of timely warnings may be
<lb/>one cause of the most fatal evils. The great practical defect
<lb/>of institutions like ours, is the circumstance that “ what is
<lb/>everybody’s business, is nobody’s business,” a neglect that
<lb/>gives to the activity of the rogue a very dangerous ascenden-
<lb break="no"/>cy over the more dilatory corrections of the honest man.”</p><p></p><p>Notes, Explanatory and Practical, on the Epistles of Paul to the
<lb/>Ephesians, Philipians, and Colossians. By Albert Barues. New
<lb/>York: Harper &amp; Brothers.</p><p></p><p>The learning and industry which distinguish these Notes
<lb/>are points about which we have heard little difference of opin-
<lb break="no"/>ion. Not the least interesting portion of the work is the In-
<lb break="no"/>troduction, which embraces an account of the situation of
<lb/>Ephesus, and the character of its people, as well as of the
<lb/>advent of the Gospel among them—also notices of the His-
<lb break="no"/>ory of its Church—of the time and places of writing the
<lb/>Epistle—with an inquiry as to its object and to whom it was
<lb/>written. This Introduction is illustrated with two wood en-
<lb break="no"/>gravings of the present Ephesus.</p><p><pb n="396"/>

<lb/>It is by no means as good a book as we have a right to expect
<lb/>from the author of “ The Mysteries of Paris;” its interest has
<lb/>been materially impaired by too close an adherence to his-
<lb break="no"/>torical fact. The chief actors are two young girls, nobly
<lb/>born, and each of an heroic devotion beautifully diverse in
<lb/>character; a youth of great sensitiveness and timidity; a
<lb/>cynical and brutal giant and buffoon ; a nobleman of the gay
<lb/>Court of Louis XIV; and an eccentric Dutch philosopher,
<lb/>of great genius and erudition.</p><p></p><p>Ocean Work, Ancient and Modern: or, Evenings on Sea and Land.

<lb/>one of the best among them. A little more science and a lit-

</p><p>We have received the first number of three new weekly
<lb/>Magazines during the past week. Two of them sprung up in
<lb/>Boston, and one in New-York. The most important of these
<lb/>new comers, in appearance, and doubtless containing the largest
<lb/>amount of vitality, is called “ The Harbinger ;” it is dedicated
<lb/>to “ Social and Political Progress.” No editor is named, but
<lb/>it is to be furnished with matter by Park Godwin, W. H.
<lb/>Channing, Albert Brisbane, Osborne Macdanniel, Horace
<lb/>Greely, George Ripley, Charles A. Dana, John S. Dwight, L.
<lb/>W. Ryckman, John Allen, and Francis S. Shaw. Some of
<lb/>these gentlemen we know to be matter-full men, and if they
<lb/>lend their aid to this new magazine, it must shortly become an
<lb/>important organ in the world of journalism. It emanates from
<lb/>the Brook Farm Association at West Roxbury, and is, as a
<lb/>matter of course, an advocate of Fourierism. The first num-
<lb break="no"/>ber contains the beginning of George Sand’s famous story
<lb/>“ Consuelo,” translated, we suppose, by F. S. Shaw, as the
<lb/>copy-right is secured to him. The Harbinger is as well printed
<lb/>as any paper of its class, but coming from an Association like
<lb/>that at Brook Farm, we expected a greater degree of elegance
<lb/>in its externals. Tuttle &amp; Dexter are the general agents.</p><p></p><p>“The Jester,” is another Boston birth; an imitation of
<lb/>Punch, but a very slender imitation indeed. The illustrations
<lb/>are better than the matter illustrated, an unusual case in an
<lb/>American publication. It wants a Lemon to give it flavor.</p><p></p><p>“ The New-Yorker,” a semi-monthly paper of eight pages,
<lb/>devoted to Temperance, Morality, and several other good
<lb/>things, is published in New-York.</p><p>THE FINE ARTS.
</p><p>We have seen a proof impression of an engraving by Smillie
<lb/>and Hinshelwood, intended for part five of Martin’s edition of
<lb/>the Bible, which will reflect great credit upon the skill of the
<lb/>artists and the liberality of the publishers. The subject is the
<lb/>“ departure of the Israelites” from a picture by David Roberts,
<lb/>one of the best painters of Eastern life and scenery now liv-
<lb break="no"/>ing. This picture has much of the grandeur of feeling pecu-
<lb break="no"/>liar to Martin's designs, and though but a few inches in size,
<lb/>is capable of creating as sublime and lofty emotions, as though
<lb/>it were stretched over an acre of canvass. The cheapness of
<lb/>illustrated books is a growing marvel. This print is of a class
<lb/>rarely sold at a price less than two dollars, yet it is here given
<lb/>away to the purchaser of one of the parts of the superb work
<lb/>which it is meant to illustrate.</p><p></p><p>We have before us, also, parts 29 and 30 of Harper's Bible,
<lb/>which is more legitimately ornamented by wood-cuts, containing
<lb/>an amount of pictorial illustrations, which, a few years ago, would
<lb/>have been considered an impossibility at the price for which
<lb/>they are now sold. The great defect of the illustrations of
<lb/>“ Harper’s Bible,” arises from their sameness of character.
<lb/>One author may well be illustrated by one artist; but to give
<lb/>all the Prophets, Psalmists, and Evangelists of the Sacred
<lb/>Book, into the hands of the same man for illustration, was a very
<lb/>dangerous experiment. To fulfil such a task properly, as the
<lb/>illustration of the whole Bible, requires an amount of genius
<lb/>and learning, which no individual ever did, or ever can, possess.
<lb/>If the Bible itself were pervaded by one tone of expression,
<lb/>it would be the most wearisome book in existence. But one
<lb/>of the charms which attracts all readers, is the almost infinite</p><p><pb n="397"/>
</p><p>variety of styles in which it is written. The Harpers’ edition,
<lb/>however, has claims to favor irrespective of its illustrations,
<lb/>which would render it a cheap and valuable work, even though
<lb/>it did not contain a tenth part of its pictures. The type, pa-
<lb break="no"/>per and ink, the correctness of the text and notes, are the
<lb/>points which must give it a permanent and reliable value.</p><p></p><p>A new Painting, by C. Deas, has lately been added to the
<lb/>Exhibition of the American Art-Union. It represents a party
<lb/>of Indians at play, and though an interesting picture, as ex-
<lb break="no"/>hibiting a trait of Indian life, it is by no means equal to the
<lb/>two last which were purchased by the Art-Union.</p><p></p><p>Mr. E. L. Carey.—Philadelphia and the whole circle of
<lb/>American artists, have met with a great loss in the death of
<lb/>Mr. E. L. Carey, who had been an invalid for the last three
<lb/>years, but was at last suddenly snatched away from his sphere
<lb/>of usefulness, after an illness of only two days. Mr. Carey
<lb/>was the most liberal and discriminating purchaser of works of
<lb/>art in the country, and he had made the very best, if not the
<lb/>most extensive collection of the productions of modern artists,
<lb/>to be found in the Union. Mr. Carey was peculiarly liberal
<lb/>towards young artists, and gave them orders without waiting
<lb/>for them to become famous. The destruction of the Pennsyl-
<lb break="no"/>vania Academy of Fine Arts is a calamity, no doubt; but it is
<lb/>one that can be repaired ; the loss of an enlightened and lib-
<lb break="no"/>eral patron, however, is one that the world of art cannot
<lb/>repair. We trust, however, that Mr. Carey’s example will not 
<lb/>be lost on the men of wealth in Philadelphia and elsewhere.</p><p></p><p>Horace Kneeland.—We are happy to learn that this de-
<lb break="no"/>serving artist has received a very liberal order from a few gen-
<lb break="no"/>tlemen of this City, Philadelphia and Boston, for another
<lb/>equestrian statue of Washington, which is to be cast in bronze.
<lb/>The model will be made here, but it will be taken to Berlin by 
<lb/>Mr. Kneeland and there cast. The commission for this statue 
<lb/>reflects the highest credit upon Mr. Kneeland’s past works,
<lb/>and is an honor to the discernment and liberality of the gentle- 
<lb/>men who have commissioned him. It also reflects disgrace, 
<lb/>which the whole country should see, on the National Academy,
<lb/>which recently refused to confer the poor title of associate 
<lb/>upon Mr. K., who has, during the past four years, exhibited
<lb/>the first busts in the annual exhibitions of the Academy, if we 
<lb/>except those by Mr. Powers. But while there are so many
<lb/>spoilers of canvass among the academicians, it can hardly be 
<lb/>expected that they should admit an artist of respectable abilities
<lb/>among their associates. In justice to the Academy, it should
<lb/>be known that the best artists belonging to it were in favor of
<lb/>Mr. Kneeland’s election.</p><p>THE CONCERT ROOM.
</p><p>New York Philharmonic Society vs. the Musical
<lb/>Fund Society of Philadelphia.—It seems that some per- 
<lb/>son corresponding with the Mirror, from Philadelphia, takes 
<lb/>the opportunity of speaking of the Musical Fund in terms of
<lb/>high commendation, while he does considerable, although per-
<lb break="no"/>haps unintentional injustice to the Philharmonic Society. 
<lb/>This Society, although by no means a benefit society, accord- 
<lb/>ing to its constitution, has yet taken a noble stand in the cause
<lb/>of humanity. We know of several instances where the funds
<lb/>have been judiciously applied, either to aid the sick, or to bury 
<lb/>the deceased brother. There is no party feeling here ; all is
<lb/>forgotten but the necessity of the case. A member of the N.
<lb/>Y. P. S., in answer to the Mirror, states that the remunera-
<lb break="no"/>tion of the members, barely amounts to one dollar for their at- </p><p>tendence at the numerous rehearsals which occur during the
season.
</p><p>This is indeed poor pay for two or three hours’ tedious re-
<lb break="no"/>hearsals during each week. It is indeed so poor that nothing
<lb/>but the right spirit of enthusiasm for their profession can in-
<lb break="no"/>duce the members to submit to such a loss.</p><p></p><p>For loving their art so well they should be commended and
<lb/>respected, but there are other points which entitle them, in
<lb/>our opinion, to still higher commendation and respect. Why
<lb/>is it that their dividend is so small—why is it that they have to
<lb/>work so hard for a remuneration so inadequate ? The Socie-
<lb break="no"/>ty is successful ! it is prosperous in the highest degree—the
<lb/>favorite with the profession and the public ! What then is the
<lb/>reason of its apparent poverty—it is that they all must willing-
<lb break="no"/>ly yield the greater portion of the results of their hard labor for
<lb/>the sake of a charity which is wide and embracing. Besides
<lb/>this, many of the members are liberal subscribers to the con-
<lb break="no"/>certs, for their families and their friends, and in this way con-
<lb break="no"/>tribute individually to the prosperity of the society. We know
<lb/>some, who instead of receiving any dividend from the receipts,
<lb/>were by their liberal subscriptions indebted to the society.</p><p></p><p>The Philharmonic Society deserve more credit for their lib-
<lb break="no"/>erality, from the fact that they pretend to nothing, but do all
<lb/>that charity requires in a sure but secret, unostentatious man-
<lb break="no"/>ner.</p><p></p><p>We have long known the necessity of a fund which should
<lb/>be devoted to the relief of indigent or aged musicians, and we
<lb/>trust that at no distant period an institution so much needed
<lb/>and so charitable in its purposes will be established ; but in the
<lb/>meantime we assure our friends in Philadelphia, that the sick
<lb/>or the needy musician, is not entirely friendless, and cannot be,
<lb/>while the Philharmonic Society continues to extend its bene-
<lb break="no"/>ficial influence over the profession of New York.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Fry,—his Critics and his Friends.—Our remarks
<lb/>upon Mr. Fry’s Leonora have called forth a lengthy reply in
<lb/>the Evening Express.</p><p></p><p>The reply is of very little moment, as nothing we have said
<lb/>is therein refuted ; indeed, the only attempt at refutation is in
<lb/>the case of Newkomn’s fine song, King Death, and in this the
<lb/>writer has signally failed, as we shall show. The writer of
<lb/>the Express first quotes our words—</p><p></p><p>“ Montalvo’s first song is ‘ King Death was a rare old fellow.'
<lb/>This song as composed by Chevalier Newkomn is universally
<lb/>known, and what could have induced Mr. Fry to introduce it into
<lb/>his Opera, unless to suggest comparison, we are at a loss to con-
<lb break="no"/>ceive. Comparisons will be drawn, and to his disadvantage, for
<lb/>the first phrases of his version prove, beyond a doubt, that New-
<lb break="no"/>komn’s fine song was fresh in his memory, and suggested, if not
<lb/>supplied the thoughts.”</p><p>He then adds:
</p><p>" Now, it so happens that Mr. Fry’s version of the song has been
<lb/>lying for years in his repertoire, and was sung in public and in
<lb/>private—(just as it is bodily introduced into ‘ Leonora,’ and per-
<lb break="no"/>formed by Mr. Seguin,) when Barry Cornwall's words were new,
<lb/>and probably long before the Chev. Newkomn ever thought of
<lb/>setting.”</p><p></p><p>Now, we don’t pretend to doubt the truth of the assertion
<lb/>that Mr. Fry’s version has been lying in his repertoire for
<lb/>years, for the original is old enough to allow of it; we remem-
<lb break="no"/>ber it some twelve or fourteen years. With regard to the “ pro-
<lb break="no"/>bability” that Mr. Fry set the words before Newkomn saw
<lb/>them, we positively state that there is not a shadow of a possi-
<lb break="no"/>bility that such should be the case, for it is a well-known fact
<lb/>that Barry Cornwall, or Proctor, wrote the words one morning
<lb/>while Newkomn was with him, and that the Chevalier compos-
<lb break="no"/>ed the music to them, as it was afterwards published, before
<lb/>he left the room. The two artists were on terms of the most
<lb/>intimate friendship, and Barry Cornwall wrote all his lyrics</p><p><pb n="398"/>
</p><p>especially for Newkomm, because, as he said, a foreigner ap-
<lb break="no"/>preciated them, and discovered their musical adaptability, when
<lb/>his own countrymen passed them by unnoticed. Mr. Fry, or
<lb/>his friends, may still claim priority, originality, &amp;c. &amp;c., but
<lb/>the fact as we have stated it cannot be disputed.</p><p></p><p>The editor of the Express refers with excessive satisfaction
<lb/>to a long, tumid, fulsomely laudatory article which appeared in
<lb/>the Express on the 9th inst. ; and which he flatteringly denomi-
<lb break="no"/>nates a criticism, comparing it triumphantly with our notice of
<lb/>the Opera. It will be seen by the following quotation that he
<lb/>considers the relative value and truth of the two articles to
<lb/>be determined by the corrections of our statement respecting
<lb/>“ King Death.”</p><p></p><p>“ Now, after this opera of ‘ Leonora’ had been played four times
<lb/>we published in this paper an extended criticism of it from the
<lb/>pen of one of the best and most impartial musical judges in this
<lb/>country. His favorable judgment of the composition and its per-
<lb break="no"/>formance have been corroborated by other writers equally un-
<lb break="no"/>prejudiced, and equally experienced. The ‘ Broadway Journal,’
<lb/>on the other hand, has this elaborate condemnation of the opera;
<lb/>and now, who is to decide which of all these critics is right ?
<lb/>Which is best entitled to public confidence, as to the merits of the
<lb/>composition in question ? We take leave to say that the paragraph
<lb/>above quoted ought to settle the dispute definitely, so far as the
<lb/>authenticity of the Journal’s infallibility is concerned, at least."</p><p></p><p>We are content to leave “ the authenticity of the Journal’s
<lb/>infallibility,” to be decided by the truth or the contrary of our
<lb/>statement.	</p><p></p><p>Our criticism throughout was a fair and impartial one, and
<lb/>has placed Mr. Fry in his true position as an imitator and not
<lb/>a creator. His blind idolatry of the modern Italian school,
<lb/>has led him to think not merely similarities, but positive iden-
<lb break="no"/>tities. He may believe honestly that they are original; his
<lb/>friends and such writers as the one in the Express, may con-
<lb break="no"/>firm him in the belief, but we assure him and them that the
<lb/>whole is a delusion. Any honest and competent writer would
<lb/>scorn to toady the individual at the expense of the art! What
<lb/>man possessing any knowledge of music, or respect for truth
<lb/>after hearing Leonora, with its endless robberies from Bellini
<lb/>&amp; Co., could sit down and pen so wilful and absurd a false-
<lb break="no"/>hood as the following from the critique in the Express—“ As
<lb/>we said in a former article, he takes rank by this work with
<lb/>the first of living masters.” Is this writer aware of the ex-
<lb break="no"/>istence of Rossini ? of Auber ? or even of those trifling writers
<lb/>Mendelssohn, Spohr, Beissiger, Marschner, Meyerbeer, and a
<lb/>hundred other writers, the least of them enjoying a sterling
<lb/>reputation from their published works, by far exceeding the
<lb/>written-up-by-my-brother’s-reputation of Mr. Fry.</p><p></p><p>Again, says this writer, “ He has achieved that which no
<lb/>man speaking the English language has yet equalled.” What
<lb/>bombast ! what fustian ! Handel spoke the English language
<lb/>fluently, Weber also, and Oberon was the result; Ferdninand
<lb/>Reiss too, and the Ice Witch was the consequence,—the Ice
<lb/>Witch was by the by, composed in six weeks, so that Reiss
<lb/>beat Fry by six weeks;—Jules Benedict may be said to have
<lb/>advanced beyond the rudiments of the English language, and
<lb/>his Operas of the Gipsey’s Warning, and the Bride of Venice
<lb/>are still extant. Then we have John Barnett, Edward Loder,
<lb/>Mcfarren, Balfe, and even Rooke, who speak English, though,
<lb/>some of them are Irish to be sure, and each of these has done
<lb/>more to win a lasting reputation than Mr. Fry in his Leonora
<lb/>gives evidence of being capable of doing. They have not
<lb/>before, certainly, contrived the monstrosity of a recitative
<lb/>Opera; but there is one man who had the audacity and the
<lb/>misfortune to live before Mr. Fry, we mean Dr. Arne who
<lb/>wrote the recitative Opera of Artaxerxes. We will not draw
<lb/>a comparison between the two works, lest we should be con-
<lb break="no"/>sidered partial; but we doubt if Leonora will live to as good
<lb/>an old age as the venerable Artaxerxes.</p><p></p><p>The “ best and most impartial of musical judges,” as the
<lb/> writer in the Express calls the writer in the Express for we
<lb/>believe that both the critique and the criticism upon our criti-
<lb break="no"/>cism, own the same paternity—we had almost said fry-ternity
<lb/>—the “ best and most impartial of musical judges,” we say—
<lb/>as the Express says—must be a very ignorant pretender in
<lb/>the art which he professes to criticise. A more uncouth jum-
<lb break="no"/>ble of unmeaning phrases will seldom be found huddled together
<lb/>in one article. He has, however, found out one great, origi-
<lb break="no"/>nal and peculiar beauty in Leonora, for which Mr. Fry certain-
<lb break="no"/>ly owes him one; we find it described in two places, in the
<lb/>following words:—“ The finale follows, introduced with a short
<lb/>passage by the Chorus fortissimo on a high key." “ The end
<lb/>of the finale is in syncopated passages on high keys for the
<lb/>whole Chorus.” Good gracious! which are the high keys ?
<lb/>—and if it be not an impertinent question, did the whole of the
<lb/>Chorus sing in different high keys ? this is an important query,
<lb/>and we should be glad to send its solution to Europe, as the
<lb/>effect of vast bodies in high keys—the Irish already have high-
<lb break="no"/>lowes—may become a standard of its class !!</p><p>There are many absurdities equally glaring, which we will
reserve for a future article.

<lb/>attentive observer of the scenes and characters which have passed before

</p><p>Mr. Rich Respectfully informs his friends and fellow-citizens that he
<lb/>has formed an establishment in Paris, in connexion with his old estab-
<lb break="no"/>lishment in Red Lion Square, for the purpose of furnishing BOOKS
<lb/>published on the continent without the heavy expense attending their
<lb/>transmission through England. Each of these establishments will be
<lb/>conducted by one of his sons, under his own general superintendence.—
<lb/>This new arrangement, he trusts, will prove of signal advantage to his
<lb/>correspondents, and no exertions will be wanting to execute their orders
<lb/>on the most advantageous terms. Orders may be sent through, and
<lb/>small sums payed to Messrs. Goodhue &amp; Co. of New-York. Two and a
<lb/>half per cent will be allowed to all those who make a remittance with
<lb/>their orders.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Rich, having made Bibliography his special study for forty years,
<lb/>possesses a knowledge of books and editions not often to be met with,
<lb/>and will be happy to give any advice and information respecting the for-
<lb break="no"/>mation of Libraries or Collections of Books in any particular branch of
<lb/>literature or science. For information in regard to his efficiency, he
<lb/>begs to refer to Messrs. Prescott, Ticknor, Sparks, Irving, and other lit-
<lb break="no"/>erary characters in the United States, to whom be is known. Intending
<lb/>to devote the remainder of his life to literary pursuits, his greatest plea-
<lb break="no"/>sure will arise from sending rare and valuable books to his own country;
<lb/>and he trusts to live long enough to see in the United States a Library
<lb/>which may bear a comparison with the most celebrated in Europe. If
<lb/>he can live to say, “ I ALso assisted IN its formation,” his most ar-
<lb break="no"/>dent wishes will be gratified.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Rich has in press—Bibliotheca Americana Nova: a Cata-

THIS is the only thorough, complete and progressive
</p><p>work yet published in this country. Where pupils have used this
<lb/>method, the most rapid advancement has been observed in all cases.
<lb/>The most prominent feature of this work is that the lessons, exercises,
<lb/>scales and studies are given in such progressive order, that they enlist
<lb/>the interests of pupils, and carry them almost imperceptibly through those
<lb/>mechanical difficulties which, otherwise, are too often made irksome in
<lb/>other instruction books. The time has arrived when a superficial know-
<lb break="no"/>ledge of the Piano is of but little account, and it is only by the study of
<lb/>such methods as Bertini's that pupils will he enabled to Read music
<lb/>with facility, and at the same time become good musicians.</p><p></p><p>This method commences in the most plain and simple manner; the
<lb/>rudiments of music being given and illustrated at the same time, and each
<lb/>lesson is fully explained by marginal notes on the same page.</p><p></p><p>The publishers are in possession of the highest recommendations from
<lb/>professional gentlemen, who speak of the superior merits of Bertini's
<lb/>Method over all others yet published in this country, most of them
<lb/>having used the foreign copies previously. It will only be necessary to
