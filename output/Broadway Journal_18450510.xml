PORTRAITS.
</p><p>Every year upon the opening of the exhibition, we hear
<lb/>the senseless cry repeated from shallow-thoughted writers,
<lb/>"too many portraits—who wants to see men’s faces—why
<lb/>don't they give us more historical works?” as if historical
<lb/>pictures were anything but groups of men’s faces. A portrait is </p><p></p><p>to a historical composition what a biography is to history,
<lb/>or a legend to a novel. For ourselves, we prefer portraiture
<lb/>to historical compositions; and we regard a good portrait as
<lb/>the very highest reach of art: and so does the world at large
<lb/>regard it. The most valuable paintings in the world are por-
<lb break="no"/>traits ; they sell at higher prices than any other pictures, and
<lb/>give the highest degree of pleasure. Even the gross beauties</p><p></p><p>of Rubens are valued more highly than any other of his
<lb/>paintings, and the portraits of Van Dyke and Titian are the
<lb/>most esteemed of their productions. Take the portraits from
<lb/>the list of Reynolds’ works, and there would be nothing left
<lb/>worth having. Among our own painters, Copley, Stewart,
<lb/>Trumbull, and Alston’s portraitures comprise the best and
<lb/>most numerous of their productions. Perhaps the finest col-
<lb break="no"/>lection of pictures in the country, is the Portrait Gallery of
<lb/>Harvard College, which contains some of the finest of Cop-
<lb break="no"/>ley’s and Stuart’s heads. A bad portrait of a bad subject
<lb/>is certainly not a pleasant thing to contemplate ; but a fine
<lb/>portrait of a fine head, is one of the most charming and pro-
<lb break="no"/>fitable objects in Art. A portrait of Shakspeare by such an
<lb/>artist as Van Dyke, would be worth more than all the histo-
<lb break="no"/>rical pictures painted in his century. It is the true object of</p><p><pb n="290"/>
</p><p>Art to counterfeit Nature, and preserve the forms which
<lb/>would be forever obliterated without its aid. We would by
<lb/>no means discourage historical composition, but then we
<lb/>would have each century paint its own history. It is very
<lb/>obvious that no painter can give us a reflection of a past age.
<lb/>We do not want mockeries in a picture, but realities. The
<lb/>modest sculptures on the ruins of Palenque, give a more vivid
<lb/>impression of the life of the Mexicans, than such pictures as
<lb/>that by Mr. Rothermel in the present exhibition can do. The
<lb/>two little pictures by Mr. Mount, numbers 145, 242, will
<lb/>convey to our descendants a better idea of their ancestors,
<lb/>than the most learned composition by one of themselves ever
<lb/>can. If we must paint historical pictures, let us paint our
<lb/>own history, which we thoroughly understand, and leave
<lb/>the dead to paint themselves. We want no masquerades on
<lb/>canvas, but living men and women in their real characters.</p><p></p><p>Our exhibition is rich in portraits, and particularly poor
<lb/>in history pieces, which we are extremely happy to see; and
<lb/>we draw more hopeful auguries for the Arts among us, than
<lb/>if the case were reversed.</p><p></p><p>We miss from the walls of the Academy the perfect por-
<lb break="no"/>traits of Page, which for many years were its chief glory in
<lb/>portraiture. It is a puzzling anomaly that one of the great-
<lb break="no"/>est artists in the country should be compelled to leave the
<lb/>metropolis, and seek for employment in a provincial town.
<lb/>But such is the truth, and a mortifying truth it is, for it
<lb/>proves that there is a want of appreciation of the highest
<lb/>order of talent in the community, or at least it seems to prove
<lb/>it, for we do not believe that there is any lack of enthusiasm
<lb/>for high Art, although fortuitous circumstances may some-
<lb break="no"/>times defeat its manifestation.</p><p></p><p>New York has just cause to feel pride in her portrait pain-
<lb break="no"/>ters, for she monopolizes nearly all the talent of the country
<lb/>in this department of Art. And we doubt whether any school
<lb/>in Europe can produce so large a number of good portrait
<lb/>painters in the same number of artists.</p><p></p><p>We have already given the post of honor in The present
<lb/>exhibition to Wenzler, a young German artist, who has here-
<lb break="no"/>tofore given his attention to miniatures. The defect of his
<lb/>portraits is their color, which is harmonious, but cold and
<lb/>leaden. It must be owing, we think, to his painting in a
<lb/>northern light. The portraits of Hugh Maxwell and Mr.
<lb/>Furness are among the very best examples of portraits that
<lb/>we have ever seen, but they are hung in a very bad position,
<lb/>and it is not easy to pronounce very clearly upon their tech-
<lb break="no"/>nical merits; yet they appear perfect in drawing, and only
<lb/>lacking in a little warmth of tone. Next to these portraits
<lb/>we must place No. 119, a portrait of Captain Erricsson, by
<lb/>Elliott, a young artist, who exhibited his first picture, a por-
<lb break="no"/>trait of Governor Seward, last year. Mr. Elliott is a native
<lb/>of the western part of the State, Syracuse; he is destined to
<lb/>occupy a very high position among the artists of the New
<lb/>World. His great danger is facility of execution ; he paints
<lb/>with great rapidity, and rarely or never fails in the like-
<lb break="no"/>ness of his subject. The portrait of the celebrated engi-
<lb break="no"/>neer is one of the most pleasing in the exhibition. We look
<lb/>at it in vain, seeking for a fault, for it is very perfect in its
<lb/>kind, harmonious in color, correct in drawing, free in execu-
<lb break="no"/>tion, and altogether a most life-like, speaking portrait. We
<lb/>are loth to qualify our praise, but it is the least degree in the
<lb/>world sketchy. However, it gains in grace what it lacks in
<lb/>solidity and finish. It is truly an admirable picture. No. 220,
<lb/>a portrait of Horace Kneeland, is a stronger head and more
<lb/>substantial, and quite as good as a likeness, but it lacks the
<lb/>dignified repose indispensable in a portrait. No. 190, the
<lb/>head of an old man with a flowing black beard, is an admi-
<lb break="no"/>rable study, painted with surprising freedom and truth. No.
<lb/>128, a Portrait of Mr. Spencer the artist, is a good sober pic-
<lb break="no"/>ture. No. 200 is a sweet face—the position exceeding grace-
<lb break="no"/>ful and unaffected. It is the least like a portrait, and the
<lb/>most like nature, of any one in the room. It is a dewy rose,
<lb/>compared with some of the artificial flowers near it.</p><p>No. 199. Portrait of T. Hicks—painted by himself. Law-
yers say that the advocate who pleads his own cause has a
</p><p>fool for his client, and the artist who paints his own portrait
<lb/>is sure of satisfying his sitter. Perhaps this is the reason
<lb/>why artists are so fond of painting themselves. We believe
<lb/>there are few painters who have not multiplied their own
<lb/>faces. The Academy has an absurd rule, requiring its asso-
<lb break="no"/>ciates to present their own portraits to he hung on its walls.
<lb/>They could not have hit upon a better plan for securing a
<lb/>collection of bad pictures. At the top of the great stairway,
<lb/>as the visiter mounts into the sky-parlor, where, for some
<lb/>inscrutable reason, the Academy holds its exhibitions, may
<lb/>be seen the best collection of caricatures in the city. One
<lb/>of the greatest curiosities among them is a head labelled
<lb/>“Bryant,” which nobody would suspect was meant for the
<lb/>poet of that name. Mr. Hicks's portrait, though painted by
<lb/>himself, is very like him, but it is not equal to some of his
<lb/>other portaits.</p><p></p><p>No. 23. Portrait of Col. Thayer—R. W. Weir, N. A. A
<lb/>full length portrait in regimentals. The position is exceed-
<lb break="no"/>ingly bad. A suspended action in a single figure produces a
<lb/>very unpleasant sensation. The head is better painted than
<lb/>any that we have seen by this artist before. The legs are
<lb/>admirably foreshortened, but if they had been shortened still
<lb/>more by being left off altogether, it would have been a bet-
<lb break="no"/>ter picture. There cannot possibly be a more uninteresting
<lb/>sight than a pair of long legs covered with white linen trow-
<lb break="no"/>sers sticking out of a portrait. The accessories in this portrait
<lb/>are finished with great care, but they are just the parts of
<lb/>the picture which are of not the least consequence. It is the
<lb/>only picture that Mr. Weir has in the exhibition.</p><p></p><p>No. 27. Portrait of Dr. Macready—J. J. Mapes, H. We
<lb/>knew that Professor Mapes was master of an infinite variety
<lb/>of accomplishments, but we were not prepared to see so good
<lb/>a portrait as this from his easel. It is a speaking likeness.</p><p></p><p>No. 36. Portrait of a Child—J. H. Lazarus. A very sweet
<lb/>picture, but it is so badly hung that it can hardly be seen to
<lb/>advantage.</p><p></p><p>No 48. Portrait of D- Bryson—E. Mooney, N. A. A sober
<lb/>truthful portrait. No. 55, W. Rowell, by the same artist, is
<lb/>equally good. These pictures only lack a little warmth of
<lb/>color to render them among the best in the exhibition. Their
<lb/>coldness must be owing to the light in which the artist
<lb/>works, for some of his portraits are almost hot in color.</p><p></p><p>No. 54. Portrait of Mrs. H. Shelton—F. Boyle. An ad-
<lb break="no"/>mirable portrait; well drawn and well colored, excepting a
<lb/>sooty hue which Mr. Boyle contrives to invest all his pictures
<lb/>with. The position is graceful, the arms well disposed, and
<lb/>the drapery elaborated with great care. Mr. Boyle is a
<lb/>painter.</p><p></p><p>No. 67. Portrait of Captain Cropper—C. C. Ingham.
<lb/>If Mr. Ingham will do himself the harm to paint portraits of
<lb/>men, we hope for his own sake that he will eschew sailors.
<lb/>He cannot put the rough externals of a weather-beaten face
<lb/>upon canvass. 169 and 184, two portraits of young ladies,
<lb/>are in his happiest manner. The shotted silk in 169 is a
<lb/>miracle, and the gauze scarf might deceive one of Stuart’s
<lb/>clerks. The ladies themselves appear to be made of finest
<lb/>clay—porcelain.</p><p></p><p>No. 69. Portrait—E. H. May. This young artist has two
<lb/>other portraits in the exhibition ; the best of the three, and
<lb/>indeed among the best portraits in the room, is No. 130; it is
<lb/>altogether a most admirable portrait, modest, substantial,
<lb/>and fleshly.</p><p></p><p>No. 83. Brig. Gen. Roumfort, of the Second Brigade,
<lb/>Philadelphia.—W. E. Winn. We are very happy to per-
<lb break="no"/>ceive that this is a production of the right-angled city. Why
<lb/>it was sent here for exhibition we are at a loss to conceive.
<lb/>Gen. Roumfort may be a brave man and good citizen, for
<lb/>aught we know to the contrary, but the artist appears to
<lb/>have tried hard to make him look like the reverse. Not
<lb/>content with giving him all the swagger possible, he has
<lb/>made the gallant General’s sword several inches longer
<lb/>than its scabbard. It is a woful picture, and it brings to
<lb/>mind most woful events, which the Philadelphians should be
<lb/>ambitious to forget.</p><p></p><p>No. 158. Portrait of a Gentleman.—T. H. Smith. There
<lb/>is nothing in this modest picture, excepting the marked
<lb/>character of the subject, to attract attention, and the posi-
<lb break="no"/>tion in which it is hung not being a favorable one. we should
<lb/>hardly have noticed it had we not known the painter to be
<lb/>one of the most industrious, most enthusiastic, and most</p><p><pb n="291"/>
promising of all our young artists. No. 221, another head of
an old gentleman, is a very truthful, unpretending portrait.
</p><p>No. 165. A Greek.—By F. Fink. This portrait attracts a
<lb/>good deal of attention, and is universally admired. The
<lb/>hands are exquisitely painted, and the whole picture reflects
<lb/>great credit on the artist. But it is not the portrait of a
<lb/>Greek ; it is a gentleman in a greek costume, and so it should
<lb/>have been called.</p><p></p><p>No. 172. Portrait of Jacob Barker.—By H. Inman, N. A.
<lb/>This is the only portrait by this gentleman in the exhibi-
<lb break="no"/>tion ; but this is one of the best that he has ever painted. It
<lb/>is a good likeness and a very pleasing picture. Considering
<lb/>that it was painted from three sittings, and those short ones,
<lb/>it must be regarded among this distinguished artist happiest
<lb/>efforts. It is somewhat slight and sketchy, but we see that
<lb/>it is just what the artist aims at in painting. The resem-
<lb break="no"/>blance of the head to the portraits of Doctor Franklin is very
<lb/>remarkable.</p><p></p><p>Bust of J. J. Mapes. By H. Kneeland. It is to the disadvan-
<lb break="no"/>tage of this excellent bust that it is the only one in the exhibi-
<lb break="no"/>tion, for it is so true to nature, so finely and purely model-
<lb break="no"/>ed that it requires to be seen by the side of ordinary works
<lb/>to make its superiority apparent. It is admirably chiseled,
<lb/>and makes the nearest approach to the perfection of Power’s
<lb/>busts of any that we have seen in any previous exhibition.
<lb/>There are many portraits still left of real merit which we
<lb/>shall notice hereafter.</p><p>ENIGMA.
INFLUX of Eternal Mind,
Nameless, formless, undefined;
Image of all things that be,—
Mirror of Eternity;
Ether, betwixt earth and heaven;
Deathless, though to mortals given;
Sphere of knowledge, soul of things,
Parent of imaginings;
Fluctuous vehicle of shape,
Nature’s idol, Reason’s ape ;
Master of the hand and eye,
Forerunner of destiny;
Dual Essence ! at thy birth
Sprang the masters of the earth;
Eros, lord of golden life,—
Passion, mingling all in strife,—
Prudence, wisdom’s early friend,—
Fancy, earning but to spend;
Last, not least, thou sawest light;—
Name thyself, O subtile sprite !
		HORUS.
ON WRITING FOR THE MAGAZINES.
</p><p>Before the days of magazines, wit and mirth, and quibs
<lb/>and jests, and glorious outbursts of temperament, must have
<lb/>lost half their relish without the after enjoyment of being
<lb/>produced in the magazines—if indeed they could ever exist
<lb/>in any conversational perfection without the suggestions and
<lb/>stimulus of the press. It is notorious now-a-days, or if not,
<lb/>it may be very readily observed that men talk to write, and
<lb/>write to talk—that the mutual collision of the babble of the
<lb/>club room and the soiree with the silence of the writing ta-
<lb break="no"/>ble, broken only by the music of the pen on paper, makes
<lb/>them perfect in both. One never talks with any knowledge
<lb/>till he writes, travelling into the secret labyrinths of thought,
<lb/>or writes with feeling till he has been warmed by the coun-
<lb break="no"/>tenance and sympathy of the living eye and voice. Our ante-
<lb break="no"/>magazinists had none of this; they left few records to their
<lb/>children of their swift passing moments; they appeared only
<lb/>in state, on special occasions in print, and handed down his-
<lb break="no"/>tory to us as little better than a Parish Register.</p><p></p><p>Negligence and ease, with enthusiasm and refinement, are
<lb/>the charms of a magazine. No one should care what a
<lb/>writer is deficient in, for this purpose, if he only excite our
<lb/>sympathy and awaken our enjoyment. Who is the prince of
<lb/>the magazinists but Christopher North, the careless slipshod
<lb/>enthusiast, a glowing Sun breaking upon us all the brighter
<lb/>out of the polar austerities of Scotland ? It was a merciful
<lb/>dispensation which sent this tropical genius to a clime
<lb/>which might naturally produce only Chamber’s Journals and</p><p></p><p>Information for the people. Soul, soul, soul are the three
<lb/>requisites for the great magazine. We like the dishabille
<lb/>air and demi-toilette of authorship, for we feel, where these
<lb/>are worn, the surrounding atmosphere is warm and genial.
<lb/>Here we prefer sensibility to sense. Political economy may
<lb/>take care of the pocket elsewhere, and the didactic play on
<lb/>some other instrument of its own. Our organ should
<lb/>breathe only the heart-stirring symphonies of Beethoven.
<lb/>We would have one shelf or more in our library for solid
<lb/>Encyclopedias and books of business, and another distinct
<lb/> where the eye may catch the golden lettering of the poets,</p><p></p><p>and those prose legers of the heart where the best affections
<lb/>are entered up monthly, and an open account kept against
<lb/>Time to the end. What a good round balance there will be
<lb/>in favor of John Wilson, Leigh Hunt, and Thomas Hood for
<lb/>instance, when three score and ten brings its settlement!</p><p></p><p>It will be seen that we restrict the magazine article pro-
<lb break="no"/>per to but one species of writing, or rather one way of think-
<lb break="no"/>ing or feeling, for the illustrations of the faculty may be va-
<lb break="no"/>rious, ranging through all the wide world of fancy, humor,</p><p></p><p>pathos, not forbidding satire—for satire, when it is not pure-
<lb break="no"/>ly malevolent, may be enjoyable, bringing us into closer com-
<lb break="no"/>panionship with our fellows. The rough points of a satirist’s
<lb/>temperament may be the cog-wheels which link us in more
<lb/>closely with the general movement from which we might
<lb/>else be separated and unhappy.</p><p></p><p>Above all things the magazine must depend upon its inte-
<lb break="no"/>rest to us for its contemporary matter. It must talk of the
<lb/>day and the hour, the whim or philosophy of the moment,
<lb/>it must be immediate and local. It must discourse readily
<lb/>upon the fashionable notoriety of the time, or read its homily
<lb/>for the benefit of the newest politician, or satirize the latest
<lb/>folly, and turn round to put us in conceit again with its con-
<lb break="no"/>veniences and virtues. Its great aim is to make us pleased
<lb/>with the world as it is, its praise must be the very otto of
<lb/>egotism and complacency, its “ feigned abuse such as per-
<lb break="no"/>plexed lovers use.” It should purify the soiled temple of the
<lb/>world, by causing us to forget all the evil and reminding us
<lb/>of all the good, removing the mildew of weariness and dis-
<lb break="no"/>gust from its shrines and altars, that the spirit may return
<lb/>and worship again pure and undismayed. Life would some-
<lb break="no"/>times pall upon us, were it not relieved by the playful graces
<lb/>of the essayist. In this day no one can be insensible to the
<lb/>benefits of literature. The most heroic act is incomplete till
<lb/>it receive the welcome, the All Hail! of the orator and poet.
<lb/>Fame dwells in books. The guardian being wanting, the
<lb/>virtue becomes extinct. If the magazines had more power it
<lb/>would be better for the state. We know not what cultiva-
<lb break="no"/>tion our statesmen, for instance, might receive if their mea-
<lb break="no"/>sures were ably reviewed by faithful writers, and their
<lb/>speeches commented upon by a body of critics who would
<lb/>be the protectors of manly eloquence. No one will long
<lb/>waste intellect where it is unheeded. “ Do not use fulmina-
<lb break="no"/>ting gold when common gunpowder will do the same,” wrote
<lb/>Moore to Leigh Hunt, when Moore thought his friend wus
<lb/>writing too well in the pages of the Reflector. Our politi-
<lb break="no"/>cians are in little danger of resorting to such a costly alchy-
<lb break="no"/>my. It is different abroad. Pulic men approach the public
<lb/>with the fear of the press before their eyes. An English de-
<lb break="no"/>bater rounds his periods by the music of the eloquent Times
<lb/>or Examiner, as by the flute of Gracchus. Our orators, with
<lb/>no such clarifying medium, speak direct to Bunkum. It is
<lb/>by the support and influence of the best men that the best
<lb/>things are done, the best words spoken, and the best books
<lb/>written. Pope has explained this in his courtly graceful</p><p>way:
“ But why then publish? Granville the polite,
And knowing Walsh, would tell me I could write ;
Well-natured Garth inflamed with early praise,
And Congreve lov’d, and Swift endur’d my lays!
The courtly Talbot, Somers, Sheffield read,
E'en mitred Rochester would nod the head,
And St. John’s self, great Dryden’s friend before,
With open arms receive one poet more.”
</p><p>There is nothing more delightful in authorship, than an
<lb/>unchecked genial strain of friendly altercation, a rivalry in
<lb/>the appreciation of one another’s qualities, where it takes
<lb/>place between men who possess something in themselves
<lb/>worth eulogizing, and are of sufficient importance for the
<lb/>world to take an interest in the matter. We know what a
<lb/>much dreaded word egotism is in society and among critics,
<lb/>and how instinctively alarm is taken by a class of very sensi-
<lb break="no"/>tive persons at the slightest approach to personality; how</p><p><pb n="292"/>
</p><p>many very careful guardians there are in the world with the
<lb/>zeal of duennas, whose prudish, nicely-educated souls are of-
<lb break="no"/>fended at an improper exhibition of self, and we appreciate
<lb/>very kindly the good taste which would reduce men and wo-
<lb break="no"/>men to a vapid state of insipidity, by closing the mouths of
<lb/>everybody to anything which might prove hazardous to the
<lb/>personal comfort of—fools. Yet in spite of all this, we are
<lb/>advocates of plain speaking, downright thinking, egotism,
<lb/>personality, and any other terror “within the limits of be-
<lb break="no"/>coming mirth,” and guarded by a never to be relinquished
<lb/>spirit of honest dealing. So long as fair play is shown, let
<lb/>us have the game out, come the good or ill fortune of it
<lb/>where it may.</p><p></p><p>One large class of objectors to the egotism of authors is
<lb/>that numerous body who are not authors, and who some-
<lb break="no"/>times affect to be superior to the supposed vanity which,
<lb/>they imagine, is at the bottom of these exhibitions in print.
<lb/>Let us look into the matter. Waiving, for a moment, all
<lb/>questions of the kind of notoriety, in the case of the author,
<lb/>it may be, as it very often is, that the name of a fault-finder,
<lb/>if he be a merchant, for instance, is a hundred times in the
<lb/>paper to the author’s once. The most greedy, carnivorous
<lb/>candidate for fame, who bites with the avidity of a pike at a
<lb/>newspaper puff, and urges his literary wares upon the pub-
<lb break="no"/>lic, amid the general laughter, and particular contempt of
<lb/>his own class, is not half so industrious as the tradesman
<lb/>with his signs, bill-heads, check-books, agencies, correspon-
<lb break="no"/>dences, runners, gazetteers, advertisements, with his name
<lb/>on every packing box, placarded on every dead wall, running
<lb/>about the streets on carts, labelled on sloops, making the
<lb/>tour of rivers on steamboats, from the broad bunting to the
<lb/>very plates and dishes in cabin, and the last pewter spoon,
<lb/>or reaching that apotheosis of reputation, the figure head
<lb/>and bow of a ship ploughing the ocean. A prolific literary
<lb/>rabbit keeps before the people with some diligence, but not
<lb/>with half the success of the last pill manufacturer. But, it
<lb/>will be said, the fact is nothing, the motive is everything.
<lb/>The merchant pursues notoriety purely as an affair of busi-
<lb break="no"/>ness, of dollar and cents, and, when these are attained, his
<lb/>own private character, his domestic interests, his heart and
<lb/>soul, are his own uncorrupted, while the author is making
<lb/>trade and merchandize of all that a man should hold most
<lb/>dear and secret, of his affections, his sensibilities, the pre-
<lb break="no"/>tended goodness of his heart, and nicety of his feelings. Is
<lb/>the merchant so entirely uncorrupted as he represents him-
<lb break="no"/>self? Is there nothing involved in his notoriety-seeking but
<lb/>matters of interest and profit ? Is it all outward, material,
<lb/>separable from the man ? No, his good name stands for a
<lb/>thousand things besides his dollars and cents. Go into the
<lb/>interior of the country, and see the fluttering which the pre-
<lb break="no"/>sence of a man whose name has stood a quarter of a century,
<lb/>with honor, in Pearl Street, creates. He may be courted for
<lb/>his wealth, but he is respected for all that stands behind it,
<lb/>the probity, the self-denial, the industry, the talent, the en-
<lb break="no"/>ergy, which have made him celebrated. Is name, is notori-
<lb break="no"/>ety nothing? Why, without any impeachment to his mo-
<lb break="no"/>desty, he goes up to the desk of the hotel, and writes his
<lb/>autograph, in the traveller’s book, with the air of a man
<lb/>drawing a check on the spectators for an unlimited amount
<lb/>of respect, attention and deference, with the certainty of its
<lb/>being honored. The merchant seeks notoriety for the same
<lb/>ends, and as nearly as he can, with the same means as the
<lb/>author. Talk not of the vanity of authors, and the love of
<lb/>puffs and notoriety, ye merchants, before editors. As sooth-
<lb break="no"/>ing to the soul of the ship-owner in South st., or the Captain
<lb/>on the seas, is a few inches of type, eulogistically arranged,
<lb/>as to the glistening eyes of the most self-idolatrous youngster,
<lb/>who ever perpetrated rhyme or prose.</p><p></p><p>We see that the merchant, in his own argument, does not
<lb/>stand quite clear of the suspicions he urges against the au-
<lb break="no"/>thor. He is very righteously and commendably strengthen-
<lb break="no"/>ing his own convictions and deference to duty by the voice
<lb/>of public opinion. And he is by no means necessarily mak-
<lb break="no"/>ing sale of his virtues, because he is prosperous by the credit
<lb/>he gets for them. The author assuredly goes further in the
<lb/>voluntary exhibition of himself,—in his egotism,—to admit
<lb/>the point at once. It is his vocation. To find fault with
<lb/>him for this is to beg the whole question. It is his business
<lb/>to write out what he knows, thinks and feels, that other men
<lb/>may learn to know, think and feel. If he were to do other-
<lb break="no"/>wise, and cease to exhibit, directly or indirectly, his own
<lb/>personal character on the page, biography would soon be an</p><p></p><p>enumeration of mere platitudes, and would fall into the very
<lb/>pretence and puffery sought to be avoided; ignorance would
<lb/>be unquestioned, folly respected, and vice unscathed ; there
<lb/>would be one biographical formula, something like that in
<lb/>the ladies’ magazines, where character and reputation are
<lb/>dispensed as freely as tin money on the stage, where genius,
<lb/>that century-blooming aloe, blooms as rankly as the "dande-
<lb break="no"/>lion in the field, and Shakspeares and Miltons go staggering
<lb/>about in bibs and petticoats. What a blessed uniformity of
<lb/>praise there would be !—what charity, what kind-hearted-
<lb break="no"/>ness!—how perfect a Utopia, how benevolent a Millennium,
<lb/>if heroes of various kinds could have it all their own way,
<lb/>unchallenged by the occasional impertinence of interfering
<lb/>sensibility and justice. What is genius but this secret
<lb/>spring of egotism, everywhere giving life to books as the
<lb/>water to the landscape which is sometimes hidden deep be-
<lb break="no"/>neath the surface, at others half concealed by foliage, then
<lb/>playing, laughing and rejoicing in a thousand streams and
<lb/>rivulets in the full blaze of day ? Egotism will be valued al-
<lb break="no"/>ways in proportion to the character of the author, as a soil
<lb/>that betrays a vein of gold is worth more than one of coal or
<lb/>slate. That it may become a nuisance, is undoubted; but
<lb/>in its annoying forms, it carries its own antidote in its very
<lb/>barefacedness. But even in its coarser and common forms,
<lb/>it has its value, as in the autobiography of Benvenuto Celli-
<lb break="no"/>ni, while no passages of the great authors are treasured
<lb/>more than those in which they pause, parenthetically, to
<lb/>convey some allusion to themselves. Who would lose the
<lb/>supposed personal reference to the blind bard in Homer, or
<lb/>the passage on Light in Milton ? and, in spite of what is
<lb/>generally said to the contrary, who does not fancy Shaks-
<lb break="no"/>peare, probably with justice, a thousand times interposing
<lb/>his own sentiments ?</p><p></p><p>We have certainly " fetched a compass” to get to our port
<lb/>of magazine writing, and vindicate its personalities. Are
<lb/>not our American writers, lecturers, preachers, politicians,
<lb/>editors, actors and other publicans, enough talked about ? It
<lb/>may be that they are too much talked about, and too little
<lb/>—that their names are better known than their actions—that
<lb/>they are often heard of, but poorly understood. We want
<lb/>the niceties of knowledge: all is nothing, mere barrenness,
<lb/>till we find out or are taught the peculiar secret principle
<lb/>which constitutes their vitality. We do not know anything
<lb/>of the men till we know that. We must have a niche for
<lb/>our writers, in the gallery of the mind, otherwise they are
<lb/>so much lumber thrown together at the threshold. No man’s
<lb/>knowledge is to be valued till he offers you something of his
<lb/>own, which is not to be picked up on the highway, or to
<lb/>which has been added some value from use or keeping. We
<lb/>get this rarely. Every one knows everything about our pub-
<lb break="no"/>lic men, few know anything. How little of all that has
<lb/>been written can we refer a stranger visiting the country to
<lb/>for a keen, just, appreciative character of our worthies!
<lb/>The magazines should be looked to for its criticism. Here
<lb/>is a field where the genuine writers of the country should
<lb/>come to one another’s help, and not leave the best charac-
<lb break="no"/>ters of our authors and statesmen, as is the fact at present,
<lb/>to be written abroad. If we wish to learn anything of our
<lb/>great men, beyond, of course, the fact that they are great,
<lb/>we must go to Miss Martineau and the foreign reviews.</p><p></p><p>Authors have always been a generous body of men to one
<lb/>another in dedications, compliments, reviews, &amp;c., and there
<lb/>is nothing more graceful or valuable than these things, when
<lb/>they are conscientiously bestowed by good and true men.
<lb/>The old scholarship of the Continent, the verses prefixed to
<lb/>the Elizabethan editions, the tributes in the writings of
<lb/>Hazlitt and his friends, are so many well remembered in-
<lb break="no"/>stances among others. It was a peculiarity of the old Eng-
<lb break="no"/>lish authors—insomuch that Leigh Hunt in his new work on
<lb/>Imagination and Fancy, has gone somewhat at length and
<lb/>apologetically into the matter, in reference to Shakspeare,
<lb/>who mentions none of his contemporaries. “ Has any body,’’
<lb/>says he, “discovered the reason why he never noticed a liv-
<lb break="no"/>ing contemporary, and but one who was dead ? and this too,
<lb/>in an age of great men, and when they were in the habit of
<lb/>acknowledging the pretensions of one another.”</p><p></p><p>How necessary this spirit of appreciation is among others,
<lb/>where literature is an affair sustained and defended by the
<lb/>few, is a point only to be suggested. In the present state of
<lb/>our literature it is of the next importance to being true to
<lb/>themselves, that literary men should be true to one another.
<lb/>Short as our history has been, and comparatively few as</p><p><pb n="293"/>
</p><p>have been our men of letters, there has been time to forget
<lb/>and neglect some of the best spirits among them. American
<lb/>criticism has yet many a genial hour’s delightful toil to
<lb/>come, in making the acquaintance of the inner life of many
<lb/>who are but little understood.—Dem. Review.</p><p>AURORA AGRICULTURAL INSTITUTE.
</p><p>A circular has been issued by several gentlemen of this County,
<lb/>for the establishment of an Institute at Aurora, in which young men
<lb/>may become thoroughly acquainted with “the principles of Agricul-
<lb break="no"/>tural Science, and their application to Practical Husbandry."
<lb/>The plan is one which received the fullest approval of the late Judge
<lb/>Buel; and the arrangements made, are such as cannot fail to offer
<lb/>every desirable inducement to those interested. The farm chosen
<lb/>consists 212 acres, adjoining the beautiful village of Aurora, which is
<lb/>well fitted by soil, location, improvement, &amp;c., for such purpose. No
<lb/>pupils under 14 years of age received. Charles C. Young, A. M. is
<lb/>Proprietor and principal; A. Thompson, A. M., M. D. Lecturer on
<lb/>Botany, Geology, Agricultural Chemistry, &amp;c., and David Thomas,
<lb/>Visitor and Adviser.—Auburn Journal.</p><p></p><p>Some of our readers may smile at seeing the announce-
<lb break="no"/>ment of an “Agricultural Institute” made the subject of an
<lb/>article in the “Broadway Journal,” but we trust that those
<lb/>who have had their eyes filled with the dust of Broadway
<lb/>since the breath of Spring has swept our streets, (the only
<lb/>sweeping by the way that they get,) will pardon us if we
<lb/>carry their mind's eyes to the contemplation of green fields
<lb/>and budding flowers. We are not without precedent, too,
<lb/>for introducing rustic themes even into “Broadway,” for
<lb/>which we cite the display of huge squashes and mammoth
<lb/>turnips at Niblo’s Saloon every autumn, to say nothing of
<lb/>that learned body of citizens called “The Farmer’s Club,”
<lb/>who meet weekly in the Park to discuss soils and fertiliz-
<lb break="no"/>ing powders.</p><p></p><p>Our readers must not suppose that we intend to cut Broad-
<lb break="no"/>way ; we have no such cruel design. We confess too much
<lb/>attachment to city life, to its libraries, and lectures, its soci-
<lb break="no"/>eties of learned men and its social advantages; we are not
<lb/>yet tired of even coal fires and gas lights; we still love to
<lb/>contemplate the various phases of human nature only to be
<lb/>found in a large city. Yet with all this admiration for the
<lb/>“town,” we are troubled at times with the “spring fever.”</p><p></p><p>No sooner does the Battery become green, or the trees in
<lb/>the Park unfold their leaves, than we feel an instinctive long-
<lb break="no"/>ing to look at the country. We yearn to pluck the first hya-
<lb break="no"/>cinth of the garden, the earliest blue violet of the field, or
<lb/>the first trilium erectum of the woods. We attribute this in-
<lb break="no"/>clination to the fact of our having spent some portion of our
<lb/>early life in the country, a pleasure which we sincerely wish
<lb/>many of the young people we meet in our walks could enjoy,
<lb/>while their hearts are fresh, and their tastes unformed by
<lb/>the conventional standards of town life.</p><p></p><p>It is not our purpose to discourse at length on the impor-
<lb break="no"/>tance of an institute founded on the plan above stated its
<lb/>benefits to our youth, and especially to the young men of our
<lb/>cities, must be apparent to all. Farming, as a learned pro-
<lb break="no"/>fession, (we mean a profession that requires learning,) is be-
<lb break="no"/>coming more and more popular; as an accomplishment, it is
<lb/>likely soon to become fashionable, and we think the sooner
<lb/>the better ; as an occupation, it has charms and advantages
<lb/>to which no other pursuit can lay claim.</p><p></p><p>A well ordered school of Agriculture, we conceive to be a
<lb/>great desideratum; and we are pleased to see public atten-
<lb break="no"/>tion directed to the subject. The day seems to have gone
<lb/>by, when education consisted only in learning words, and the
<lb/>whole youthful life must be spent on a form, torturing the
<lb/>brain and destroying the body. It has been discovered that
<lb/>physical as well as mental training is necessary to the full
<lb/>development of our nature. The philosophy of Socrates and
<lb/>Plato—the philosophy of words has long since given way to
<lb/>the philosophy of Bacon—the philosophy of works.</p><p></p><p>To those boys who have for years been poring over dull
<lb/>pages of Greek and Latin, whose eyes have become weak
<lb/>and weary with much study—whose brains have been puz-
<lb break="no"/>zled with irregular verbs and heathen Mythology, and their</p><p>bodies enervated by the confinement of the school-room,____
how delightful must be the change, to the pure fresh air of
the fields and the invigorating labor of practical husbandry.
</p><p>The situation of the Aurora Institute is peculiarly favora-
<lb break="no"/>ble to the objects for which it is established. The eastern
<lb/>bank of the Cayuga Lake, the site of the beautiful village of
<lb/>Aurora, is in the centre of the famous wheat growing dis-
<lb break="no"/>trict of this State ; for beauty of scenery, fertility of soil, and
<lb/>salubrity of climate it is not surpassed by any section of our
<lb/>country.</p><p></p><p>In the capacity of Visitor and Adviser, this institute will
<lb/>have the services of one of the most competent men in the
<lb/>State. There are many men better known to the public
<lb/>than David Thomas, but none more esteemed by the large
<lb/>number of scientific men who rejoice in his acquaintance.
<lb/>Well versed in the natural sciences, and peculiarly gifted
<lb/>with the faculty of imparting his knowledge to others, he is
<lb/>most fitly chosen for his office.</p><p></p><p>Whatever advantages this institution may possess, none
<lb/>will be more truly appreciated by the youth who resort thith-
<lb break="no"/>er, than the society and instruction of this learned and good
<lb/>man.</p><p>THREE SUNDAYS IN A WEEK.
</p><p>“You hard-hearted, dunder-headed, obstinate, rusty,
<lb/>crusty, musty, fusty, old savage !” said I in fancy, one after-
<lb break="no"/>noon, to my grand uncle Rumgudgeon—shaking my fist at
<lb/>him in imagination.</p><p></p><p>Only in imagination. The fact is, some trivial discrepan-
<lb break="no"/>cy did exist, just then, between what I said and what I had
<lb/>not the courage to say—between what I did and what I had
<lb/>half a mind to do.</p><p></p><p>The old porpoise, as I opened the drawing-room door,
<lb/>was sitting with his feet upon the mantel-piece, and a bum-
<lb break="no"/>per of port in his paw, making strenuous efforts to ac-
<lb break="no"/>complish the ditty,</p><p>Remplis ton verre vide !
Vide ton verre plein !
</p><p>“My dear uncle,” said I, closing the door gently, and ap-
<lb break="no"/>proaching him with the blandest of smiles, “you are always
<lb/>so very kind and considerate, and have evinced your benevo-
<lb break="no"/>lence in so many—so very many ways—that—that I feel I
<lb/>have only to suggest this little point to you once more to
<lb/>make sure of your full acquiescence.”</p><p>“ Hem!” said he, “ good boy ! go on !”
</p><p>“ I am sure, my dearest uncle [you confounded old rascal!]
<lb/>that you have no design really, seriously, to oppose my union
<lb/>with Kate. This is merely a joke of yours, I know—ha! ha!
<lb/>ha !—how very pleasant vou are at times.”</p><p>“ Ha! ha ! ha !” said he, “ curse you ! yes!”
</p><p>“ To be sure—of course ! I knew you were jesting. Now,
<lb/>uncle, all that Kate and myself wish at present, is that you
<lb/>would oblige us with your advice as—as regards the time—
<lb/>you know, uncle—in short, when will it be most convenient
<lb/>for yourself, that the wedding shall—shall—come off, you
<lb/>know?”</p><p>“ Come off, you scoundrel!—what do you mean by that ?
Better wait till it goes on.”
</p><p>Ha ! ba! ha !—he ! he! he!— hi! hi! hi!—ho! ho! ho !—
<lb/>hu!hu!hu!—oh, that’s good!—oh, that’s capital—such a
<lb/>wit! But all we want, just now, you know, uncle, is that
<lb/>you would indicate the time precisely.”</p><p>“Ah !—precisely ?”
“ Yes, uncle—that is, if it would be quite agreeable to
yourself.”
 “ Would’nt it answer, Bobby, if I were to leave it at ran-
dom—some time within a year or so, for example ?—must I
say precisely ?”
“If you please, uncle—precisely.-
“Well, then, Bobby, my boy—you’re a fine fellow, are’nt
<pb n="294"/>
you ?—since you will have the exact time, I’ll—why, I’ll
oblige you for once.”
“ Dear uncle !”
</p><p>“Hush, sir!” [drowning my voice]—“I’ll oblige you for
<lb/>once. You shall have my consent—and the plum, we mus’nt
<lb/>forget the plum—let me see ! when shall it be ? To-day’s
<lb/>Sunday—is’nt it? Well, then, you shall be married precise-
<lb break="no"/>ly—precisely, now mind!—when three Sundays come toge-
<lb break="no"/>ther in a week ! Do you hear me, sir! What are you gaping
<lb/>at ? I say, you shall have Kate and her plum when three
<lb/>Sundays come together in a week—but not till then—you
<lb/>young scapegrace—not till then, if I die for it. You know
<lb/>me—I’m a man of my word—now be off!” Here he swal-
<lb break="no"/>lowed his bumper of port, while I rushed from the room in
<lb/>despair.</p><p></p><p>A very “fine old English gentleman," was my grand-
<lb break="no"/>uncle Rumgudgeon, but unlike him of the song, he had his
<lb/>weak points. He was a little, pursy, pompous, passionate,
<lb/>semicircular somebody, with a red nose, a thick scull, a long
<lb/>pur e, and a strong sense of his own consequence. With the
<lb/>best heart in the world, he contrived, through a predominant
<lb/>whim of contradiction, to earn for himself, among those who
<lb/>only knew him superficially, the character of a curmudgeon.
<lb/>Like many excellent people, he seemed possessed with a
<lb/>spirit of tantalization, which might easily, at a casual glance,
<lb/>have been mistaken for malevolence. To every request, a
<lb/>positive " No!” was his immediate answer ; but in the end—
<lb/>in the long, long end—there were exceedingly few requests
<lb/>which he refused. Against all attacks upon his purse he
<lb/>made the most sturdy defence; but the amount extorted from
<lb/>him, at last was, generally, in direct ratio with the length of
<lb/>the siege and the stubbornness of the resistance. In charity
<lb/>no one gave more liberally or with a worse grace.</p><p></p><p>For the fine arts, and especially for the belles lettres he
<lb/>entertained a profound contempt. With this he had been in-
<lb break="no"/>spired by Casimir Perier, whose pert little query “ A quoi un
<lb/>poete est il bon?" he was in the habit of quoting, with a very
<lb/>droll pronunciation, as the ne plus ultra of logical wit. Thus
<lb/>my own inkling for the Muses had excited his entire dis-
<lb break="no"/>pleasure. He assured me one day, when I asked him for a
<lb/>new copy of Horace, that the translation of “ Poeta nascitur
<lb/>non fit"  was a nasty poet for nothing fit”—a remark which
<lb/>I took in high dudgeon. His repugnance to “ the humani-
<lb break="no"/>ties had, also, much increased of late, by an accidental bias
<lb/>in favor of what he supposed to be natural science. Some-
<lb break="no"/>body had accosted him in the street, mistaking him for no
<lb/>less a personage than Doctor Dubble L. Dee, the lecturer
<lb/>upon quack physics. This set him off at a tangent; and just
<lb/>at the epoch of this story—for story it is getting to be after
<lb/>all—my grand uncle Rumgudgeon was accessible and paci-
<lb break="no"/>fic only upon points which happened to chime in with the
<lb/>caprioles of the hobby he was riding. For the rest, he laugh-
<lb break="no"/>ed with his arms and legs, and his politics were stubborn and
<lb/>easily understood. He thought, with Horsley, that “the
<lb/>people have nothing to do with the laws but to obey them."</p><p></p><p>I had lived with the old gentleman all my life. My pa-
<lb break="no"/>rents, in dying, had bequeathed me to him as a rich legacy.
<lb/>I believe the old villain loved me as his own child—nearly
<lb/>if not quite as well as he loved Kate—but it was a dog’s ex-
<lb break="no"/>istence that he led me, after all. From my first year until
<lb/>my fifth, he obliged me with very regular Hoggings. From
<lb/>five to fifteen, he threatened me, hourly, with the House of
<lb/>Correction. From fifteen to twenty, not a day passed in
<lb/>which he did not promise to cut me off with a shilling. I
<lb/>was a sad dog, it is true—but then it was a part of my na-
<lb break="no"/>ture—a point of my faith. In Kate, however, I had a firm
<lb/>friend, and I knew it. She was a good girl, and told me
<lb/>very sweetly that I might have her (plum and all) whenever
<lb/>I could badger my grand uncle Rumgudgeon, into the neces-
<lb break="no"/>sary consent. Poor girl!—she was barely fifteen, and with-
<lb break="no"/>out this consent, her little amount in the funds was not come-
<lb break="no"/>at-able until five immeasurable summers had “dragged their
<lb/>slow length along.” What, then, to do? At fifteen, or even
<lb/>at twenty-one [for 1 had now passed my fifth olympiad] five
<lb/>years in prospect are very much the same as five hundred.
<lb/>In vain we besieged the old gentleman with importunities.
<lb/>Here was a piece de resistance (as Messieurs Ude and Ca-
<lb break="no"/>reme would say) which suited his perverse fancy to a T. It
<lb/>would have stirred the indignation of Job himself, to see how
<lb/>much like an old mouser he behaved to us two poor wretch-
<lb break="no"/>ed little mice. In his heart he wished for nothing more ar-
<lb break="no"/>dently than our union. He had made up his mind to this</p><p></p><p>all along. In fact, he would have given ten thousand pounds
<lb/>from his own pocket (Kate’s plum was her own) if he could
<lb/>have invented anything like an excuse for complying with
<lb/>our very natural wishes. But then we had been so impru-
<lb break="no"/>dent as to broach the subject ourselves. Not to oppose it
<lb/>under such circumstances, I sincerely believe was not in his
<lb/>power.</p><p></p><p>I have said already that he had his weak points; but, in
<lb/>speaking of these, I must not be understood as referring to
<lb/>his obstinacy: that was one of his strong points—“assure-
<lb break="no"/>ment ce n’etait pas sa foible.” When I mention his weakness
<lb/>I have allusion to a bizarre old-womanish superstition which
<lb/>beset him. He was great in dreams, portents, et id genus
<lb/>omne of rigmarole. He was excessively punctilious, too, upon
<lb/>small points of honor, and, after his own fashion, was a man
<lb/>of his word, beyond doubt. This was, in fact, one of his
<lb/>hobbies. The spirit of his vows he made no scruple of set-
<lb break="no"/>ting at naught, but the letter was a bond inviolable. Now
<lb/>it was this latter peculiarity in his disposition, of which
<lb/>Kate’s ingenuity enabled us, one fine day, not long after our
<lb/>interview in the dining room, to lake a very unexpected ad-
<lb break="no"/>vantage ; and, having thus, in the fashion of all modern bards
<lb/>and orators, exhausted, in prolegomena, all the time at my
<lb/>command, and nearly all the room at my disposal, I will sum
<lb/>up in a few words what constitutes the whole pith of the
<lb/>story.</p><p></p><p>It happened then—so the Fates ordered it—that among
<lb/>the naval acquaintances of my betrothed, were two gentle-
<lb break="no"/>men who had just set foot upon the shores of England, after
<lb/>a year’s absence, each, in foreign travel. In company with
<lb/>these gentlemen, my cousin and I preconcertedly, paid uncle
<lb/>Rumgudgeon a visit on the afternoon of Sunday, October the
<lb/>tenth—just three weeks after the memorable decision which
<lb/>had so cruelly defeated our hopes. For about half an hour
<lb/>the conversation ran upon ordinary topics; but at last, we
<lb/>contrived, quite naturally, to give it the following turn:
<lb/>Capt. Pratt. “Well, I have been absent just one year.—
<lb/>Just one year to-day,as I live—let me see! yes!—this is Oc-
<lb break="no"/>tober the tenth. You remember, Mr. Rumgudgeon, I called,
<lb/>this day year, to bid you good-bye. And by the way, it does
<lb/>seem something like a coincidence, does it not—that our
<lb/>friend Captain Smitherton, here, has been absent exactly a
<lb/>year also—a year to-day ?”</p><p></p><p>Smitherton. “Yes! just one year to a fraction. You will
<lb/>remember, Mr. Rumgudgeon, that I called with Capt. Pratol
<lb/>on this very day, last year, to pay my parting respects.”
<lb/>Uncle. “Yes, yes, yes—I remember it very well—very
<lb/>queer, indeed ! Both of you gone just one year. A very strange
<lb/>coincidence, indeed ! Just what Doctor Dubble L. Dee would
<lb/>denominate an extraordinary concurrence of events. Doctor
<lb/>Dub—”</p><p></p><p>Kate. (Interrupting.) “ To be sure, papa, it is something
<lb/>strange; but then Captain Pratt and Captain Smitherton
<lb/>didn’t go alttogether the same route, and that makes a
<lb/>difference, you know.”</p><p></p><p>Uncle. “I don’t know any such thing, you huzzey ! How
<lb/>should I ? I think it only makes the matter more remarkable.
<lb/>Doctor Dubble L. Dee”—</p><p></p><p>Kate. “Why, papa, Captain Pratt went round Cape Horn,
<lb/>and Captain Smitherton doubled the Cape of Good Hope.”
<lb/>Uncle. “ Precisely !—the one went east and the other went
<lb/>west, you jade, and they both have gone quite round the
<lb/>world. By the bye, Doctor Dubble L. Dee"—</p><p></p><p>Myself, (hurriedly.) “ Captain Pratt, you must come and
<lb/>spend the evening with us to-morrow—you and Smitherton—
<lb/>you can tell us all about your voyage, and we’ll have a game
<lb/>of whist, and”—</p><p>Pratt. “Whist, my dear fellow—you forget. To-morrow
will be Sunday. Some other evening’’—
Kale. “Oh no, fie !—Robert’s not quite so bad as that.
To-day's Sunday.”
Uncle. “To be sure—to be sure !’’
Pratt. “ I beg both your pardon’s—but I can’t be so much
mistaken. I know to-morrow's Sunday because”—
</p><p>Smitherton, (much surprised.) “What are you all think-
<lb break="no"/>ing about? Was’nt yesterday Sunday, I should like to
<lb/>know ?”</p><p>All. “ Yesterday, indeed ! you are out."
Unde. “ To-day’a Sunday, I say—don't I know ?’’
Pratt. Oh no !—to-morrow's Sunday.”
Smitherton. “ You are all mad—every one of you. I am
<pb n="295"/>
as positive that yesterday was Sunday as I am that I sit upon
this chair.”
</p><p>Kate, (jumping up eagerly.) “I see it—I see it all. Papa,
<lb/>this is a judgment upon you, about—about you know what.
<lb/>Let me alone, and I’ll explain it all in a minute. It’s a very
<lb/>simple thing, indeed. Captain Smitherton says that yester-
<lb break="no"/>day was Sunday: so it was; he is right. Cousin Bobby, and
<lb/>uncle and I, say that to-day is Sunday: so it is; we are right.
<lb/>Captain Pratt maintains that to-morrow will be Sunday; so
<lb/>it will ; he is right too. The fact is, we are all right, and
<lb/>thus three Sundays have come together in a week."</p><p></p><p>Smitherton, (after a pause.) “By the bye, Pratt, Kate has
<lb/>us completely. What fools we two are! Mr. Rumgudgeon,
<lb/>the matter stands thus: the earth, you know, is twenty-four
<lb/>thousand miles in circumference. Now this globed the earth
<lb/>turns upon its own axis—revolves—spins round—these
<lb/>twenty-four thousand miles of extent, going from west to
<lb/>east, in precisely twenty-four hours. Do you understand,
<lb/>Mr. Rumgudgeon ?”</p><p>Uncle. “ To be sure—to be sure—Doctor Dub”—
</p><p>Smitherton, (drowning his voice.) “Well, sir: that is at
<lb/>the rate of one thousand miles per hour. Now suppose that
<lb/>I sail from this position a thousand miles east. Of course, I
<lb/>anticipate the rising of the sun here at London, by just one
<lb/>hour. I see the sun rise one hour before you do. Proceed-
<lb break="no"/>ing, in the same direction, yet another thousand miles, I an-
<lb break="no"/>ticipate the rising by two hours—another thousand, and I
<lb/>anticipate it by three hours—and so on, until I go entirely
<lb/>round the globe, and back to this spot, when, having gone
<lb/>twenty-four thousand miles east, I anticipate the rising of
<lb/>the London sun by no less than twenty-four hours; that is to

TO ONE IN PARADISE.
Thou wast all that to me, love,
For which my soul did pine—
A green isle in the sea, love,
A fountain and a shrine,
All wreathed with fairy fruits and flowers,
And all the flowers were mine.
Ah, dream too bright to last!
Ah, starry Hope ! that didst arise
But to be overcast!
A voice from out the Future cries,
"On ! on !”—but o’er the Past
(Dim gulf!) my spirit hovering lies
Mute, motionless, aghast!
For, alas! alas ! with me
The light of Life is o’er!
(Such language holds the solemn sea
To the sands upon the shore)
Shall bloom the thunder-blasted tree,
Or the stricken eagle soar!
And all my days are trances,
And all my nightly dreams 
Are where thy dark eye glances,
And where thy footstep gleams—
In what ethereal dances,
By what eternal streams.

REVIEWS.
</p><p>The first Three Books of Homer’s Iliad, according to the Ordi-
<lb break="no"/>dinary Text, and also with the restoration of the Digamma, to
<lb/>which are appended English Notes, critical and explanatory, a
<lb/>Metrical Index, and Homer’s Glossary. By Charles Anthon,
<lb/>L.L. D., Jay Professor of the Greek and Latin Languages in Colum-
<lb break="no"/>bia College, New York, and Rector of the Grammar School. New
<lb/>York: Harper &amp; Brothers.</p><p></p><p>This is one of the series of “School and College Classics”
<lb/>which have attracted so general an attention, first, from their
<lb/>comprehensiveness, and admirable adaptation to their ob-
<lb break="no"/>jects, and, secondly from their punctilious accuracy and beau-
<lb break="no"/>ty of typographical execution. We have seen richer, gaudier,
<lb/>but never more truly beautiful books. The Greek text, in
<lb/>this Homer, with the frequent digammas, is certainly the
<lb/>most graceful and picturesque specimen of printing we ever
<lb/>beheld.</p><p></p><p>The volume contains all of the Iliad which is usually read
<lb/>at school, as preparatory to a collegiate course—sufficient
<lb/>to furnish the student with the principles of Homeric trans-
<lb break="no"/>lation and analysis. The text is, in the main, that of Spitz-
<lb break="no"/>ner, which is now generally regarded as the best;—although
<lb/>on some occasions, alterations have been adopted, and the
<lb/>reasons given in a note. Besides the regular text of Spitzner,
<lb/>there is that of Richard Payne Knight, with the digamma
<lb/>restored according to his views. In fact, it is by no means
<lb/>improbable that this secondary text is at least a close ap-
<lb break="no"/>proximation to the ancient orthography of Homer—although
<lb/>many discrepancies might be pointed out, going to show that
<lb/>in many cases the learned commentator could not have been
<lb/>otherwise than wrong in his conjectures. The work of
<lb/>Knight is extremely rare in this country, and even as a mere
<lb/>matter of curious speculation, Dr. Anthon has rendered a
<lb/>public service by introducing the restorations in question.</p><p></p><p>The commentary, as in all this series of classics, is pecu-
<lb break="no"/>liarly full and explicit—proceeding on the sole ground which
<lb/>is admissible in matters of scholastic instruction—the ground
<lb/>that the scholar is absolutely ignorant, and has need of infor-
<lb break="no"/>mation at all points, however seemingly trivial. No error is
<lb/>more fatal in tuition, than that of taking it for granted that
<lb/>the student knows any thing at all. The materials of the
<lb/>Notes are derived, chiefly, from Wolf, Heyne, Buttman, Na-
<lb break="no"/>gelsbach, and Stadelmann, and the Commentary includes
<lb/>every thing that is really valuable in the works of these
<lb/>eminent scholars. The Glossary is separated from the Notes,</p><p> - a very judicious arrangement—and contains a great deal
</p><p>of novel information in regard to the parsing of the Homeric
<lb/>Greek. It is distinguished, also, from every Homeric Lexicon
<lb/>which has preceded it (in English) by its introduction and
<lb/>application to the Homeric text, of the Sanscrit and Lin-
<lb break="no"/>guistic Etymologies:—an Index to the Glossary is subjoined.
<lb/>The Metrical Index has been constructed with especial refer-
<lb break="no"/>ence to the doctrine of the digamma and its bearing upon
<lb/>the Homeric versification.</p><p></p><p>Upon the whole, this edition of Homer is not only one of
<lb/>the most valuable of the series, but one of the most impor-
<lb break="no"/>tant additions to classical literature which this country or
<lb/>any other has produced.</p><p>Letters from New York. Second Series. By L. M. Child. New
York. C. S. Francis, &amp; Co. 1845.
</p><p>The great popularity of the first series of Mrs. Child’s let-
<lb break="no"/>ters from New York, will insure a hearty welcome and a
<lb/>large sale for this new volume. Without possessing any of
<lb/>the charms which private epistles derive from their confi-
<lb break="no"/>dential revelations and bits of private scandal that all peo-
<lb break="no"/>ple love, the letters of Mrs. Child make a direct appeal to</p><p><pb n="296"/>
</p><p>every human heart and cause the reader to feel as though
<lb/>they had been addressed to himself personally. It is because
<lb/>the author opens her own heart that she gains admission to
<lb/>the hearts of others so rapidly. Nothing will so disarm re-
<lb break="no"/>serve as confidence; ice can alone be melted by heat; hatred
<lb/>and anger must be overcome by love and kindness. Bitter,
<lb/>sarcastic writers can never hope for popularity, or at least
<lb/>love. We rarely see one of Swift’s essays carried about as a
<lb/>pocket companion, but the good natured genial writings of
<lb/>Goldsmith are oftener bound up as pocket volumes than the
<lb/>works of any other author. The popularity of Mrs. Child’s
<lb/>letters must be attributed to a similar cause ; and to the fact
<lb/>that they treat of human beings and things that interest hu-
<lb break="no"/>manity. The sympathies of men are more wide than we
<lb/>are apt to believe. The stories of washerwomen, of street-
<lb break="no"/>sweepers and little beggar children, interest us beyond the
<lb/>most elaborate histories of merely official personages. Mrs.
<lb/>Child instinctively seizes upon subjects which are interesting
<lb/>to all classes, to men and women rather than to statesmen,
<lb/>or ladies and gentlemen. The present volume of her letters
<lb/>has a most taking table of contents. 'Christmas,’ 'Ole Bul,’</p><p>'New Year’s Festivities,’ 'Valentine’s Day,’ 'Fourth of July,’
</p><p>'Children in Union Park,’ 'Genius and Skill,’ ‘Greenwood
<lb/>Cemetery,’ 'The Violin,’ 'Autumn Woods,’ The Spirite of
<lb/>Trade,’ 'Sir Harry Falkland;’ these are some of the titles
<lb/>to the letters ; suggestive of charming reading and delight-
<lb break="no"/>ful heart-touching subjects.</p><p>We make an extract from the last letter.
</p><p>Rapid approximation to the European style of living is more and
<lb/>more observable in this city. The number of servants in livery visi-
<lb break="no"/>bly increases every season. Foreign artistic upholsterers assert that
<lb/>there will soon be more houses in New York furnished according to
<lb/>the fortune and taste of noblemen, than there are either in Paris or
<lb/>London ; and this prophesy may well be believed, when the (act
<lb/>is considered that it is already not very uncommon to order furniture
<lb/>for a single room, at the cost of ten thousand dollars. There would
<lb/>be no reason to regret this lavishness, if the convenience and beauty
<lb/>of social environment were really increased in proportion to the ex-</p><p></p><p>penditure, and if there were a progressive tendency to equality in the
<lb/>distribution. But, alas, a few moments’ walk from saloons superbly
<lb/>furnished in the style of Louis 14th, brings us to Loafer’s Hall, a
<lb/>dreary desolate apartment, where shivering little urchins pay a cent
<lb/>apiece, for the privilege of keeping out of watchmen’s hands, by
<lb/>sleeping on boards ranged in tiers.</p><p></p><p>But the effects of a luxurious and artificial life are sad enough on
<lb/>those who indulge in it, without seeking for painful contrast among 
<lb/>the wretchedly poor. Sallow complexions, feeble steps, and crooked
<lb/>spines, already show an obvious deterioration in beauty, grace, and j
<lb/>vigor. Spiritual bloom and elasticity are still more injured by modes 
<lb/>of life untrue to nature. The characters of women suffer more than j
<lb/>those of men, because their resources are fewer. Very many things 
<lb/>are considered unfeminine to be done, and of those duties which are
<lb/>feminine by universal consent, few are deemed genteel by the upper
<lb/>classes. It is not genteel for mothers to wash and dress their own
<lb/>children, or make their clothing, or teach them, or romp with them
<lb/>in the open air. Thus the most beautiful and blessed of all human
<lb/>relations performs but half its healthy and renovating mission. The
<lb/>full, free, joyful growth of heart and soul is everywhere impeded by 
<lb/>artificial constraint, and nature has her fountains covered by vanity 
<lb/>and pride. Some human souls, finding themselves fenced within such
<lb/>narrow limits by false relations, seek fashionable distinction, or the
<lb/>excitement of gossip, flirtation, and perpetual change, because they
<lb/>can find no other unforbidden outlets for the irrepressible activity of
<lb/>mind and heart. A very few, of nature’s noblest and strongest,
<lb/>quietly throw off the weight that presses on them, and lend a com-
<lb break="no"/>paratively true life in the midst of shams, which they reprove only
<lb/>by example. Those who can do this, without complaint or noise,
<lb/>and attempt no defence of their peculiar course, except the daily
<lb/>beauty of their actions, will work out their freedom at last, in the
<lb/>most artificial society that was ever constructed ; but the power to
<lb/>do this requires a rare combination of natural qualifier. For the few
<lb/>who do accomplish this difficult task, I even feel more respect than
<lb/>I do for those who struggle upward under the heavy burden of early
<lb/>poverty. “For wealth bears heavier on talent, than poverty. Under
<lb/>gold mountains and thrones, who knows how many a spiritual giant
<lb/>may lie crushed down and buried?” I once saw a burdock shoot up
<lb/>so vigorously, that it threw off a piece of board in the platform,
<lb/>which covered it front light and air. I had great respect for the brave
<lb/>plant, and even carried my sympathy so far, as to reproach myself
<lb/>for not haring lifted the board it was trying to bard to raise, instead
<lb/>of watching it curiously, to see how much it could do. The pressure
<lb/>of artificial life, I cannot take off from souls that are born in the
<lb/>midst of it; and few have within themselves such uplifting life as the
<lb/>burdock.</p><p>It is one of the saddest sights to see a young girl, born of wealthy
</p><p>and wordly parents, full of heart and soul, her kindly impulses con-
<lb break="no"/>tinually checked by etiquette, her noble energies repressed by gen-
<lb break="no"/>teel limitations. She must not presume to love any body, till father
<lb/>and mother find a suitable match ; she must not laugh loud because it
<lb/>is vulgar ; she must not walk fast because it is ungenteel; she must
<lb/>not work in the garden, for fear the sun and wind may injure her
<lb/>complexion; she must sew nothing but gossamer, lest it mar the
<lb/>delicacy of her hands ; she must not study, because gentlemen do
<lb/>not admire literary ladies. Thus left without ennobling objects of
<lb/>interest, the feelings and energies are usually concentrated on frivo-
<lb break="no"/>lous and unsatisfactory pursuits, and woman becomes a by-word and
<lb/>a jest, for her giddy vanity, her love of dress and beaux.</p><p>The Pencil of Nature. By H. Fox Talbot: London, 1844. Imported
by Wiley &amp; Putnam, 161 Broadway. Nos. 1 and 2.
</p><p>This is the first attempt to publish a series of pictures, made
<lb/>entirely by Nature herself. They are produced by the pho-
<lb break="no"/>tographic process, and are of course as true, excepting in co-
<lb break="no"/>lor, as truth herself. These reflections of Nature are fixed
<lb/>upon sensitive paper instead of metal plates, as in the Da-
<lb break="no"/>guerrian process; and each picture is an original work. The
<lb/>“Pencil of Nature” is a somewhat fanciful term, and not a
<lb/>very correct one, for these impressions partake of the charac-
<lb break="no"/>ter of a medallion more than of painting. But we are not
<lb/>disposed to pick differences about terms, the work itself is
<lb/>entitled to the highest consideration, and every one who in-
<lb break="no"/>spects it will draw his own auguries of its influence on the
<lb/>imitative Arts. The author gives a very full and lucid state-
<lb break="no"/>ment of the first discovery of his art, and of the process by
<lb/>which it has been carried to its present high condition. By
<lb/>pure chance, Monsieur Daguerre has reaped nearly all the
<lb/>honors of the discovery which Mr. Fox Talbot made simul-
<lb break="no"/>taneously with him. There are twelve plates in the two
<lb/>numbers of Mr. Talbot’s publication, which very satisfacto-
<lb break="no"/>rily prove the importance of the art in giving actual views of
<lb/>almost any kind of still life. In making copies of architectu-
<lb break="no"/>ral ornaments and pictures, it must be found of very great
<lb/>advantage; and even in copying curious manuscripts and rare
<lb/>old books, it is found of great service, as may be seen from
<lb/>a fac-simile of a page of an old Norman-French book, con-
<lb break="no"/>taining the statutes of Richard the Second.</p><p></p><p>The view on the Boulevard at Parts, taken from one of the
<lb/>upper windows of the Hotel de Douvres on the corner of the
<lb/>Rue de la Paix, is a most delightful picture which transports
<lb/>the spectator in a visit to the French Capital. It has noth-
<lb break="no"/>ing of the doubtful aspect or indistinctness of a painting, but
<lb/>is indeed. Paris itself. The street has just been watered and
<lb/>is under repair, as seen by a couple of wheel-barrows
<lb/>which stand in the fore ground. By the road side a row of
<lb/>Cittadines and Cabriolets are waiting, and a carriage is stand-
<lb break="no"/>ing in the distance. It is the Broadway, as much as this is
<lb/>Broadway which we look into when we raise our head.
<lb/>But, goodness, what a range of fantastic chimney-pipes bor-
<lb break="no"/>ders the horizon, forest of flues of all conceivable shapes.
<lb/>The corner house on the right hand is a bathing house, with
<lb/>"Bains” painted on the wall. Saving the mansion with a
<lb/>railing in front it looks for all the world like a New York
<lb/>house; we can look into the garret window and almost dis-
<lb break="no"/>cern a Grisette at her employment. It is a cheap view of
<lb/>Paris.</p><p></p><p>The most charming of all the impressions however is the
<lb/>reflection of an English haystack, which brings us an English
<lb/>market scene as truly as though we were looking out of an
<lb/>English window upon an English farm-yard. The sunshine
<lb/>which falls upon it is English sun-shine; it has lighted up
<lb/>an object three thousand miles away, and now shines as
<lb/>brightly on our desk as it did a year ago in Somersetshire,
<lb/>or in pleasant Kent, for the locality of the haystack is not
<lb/>given. The book itself, considered merely as a book, is a
<lb/>rare specimen of luxurious publishing, and the ornament on
<lb/>the cover is worth to an ornamental artist, for a study, more
<lb/>than its contents</p><p>Saul, A Mystery. By the Author of “Christian Ballads,” "Athan-
asion,” etc. etc. etc. New York : D. Appleton, &amp; Co.
</p><p>This poem was announced as about to be published in the
<lb/>fall of 1842, but withheld for private reasons. It is the lon-
<lb break="no"/>gest dramatic work ever written, we believe, by an Ameri-
<lb break="no"/>can,—occupying more than 280 pages, large duodecimo. The
<lb/>history on which it is founded, is contained in the Books of
<lb/>Samuel, commencing with the twentieth chapter of the first
<lb/>book, and ending with the first chapter of the second. “It
<lb/>may be proper to say," says the author in a note, "that I am
<lb/>not acquainted with any other poem in the language plotted</p><p><pb n="297"/>
</p><p>on the same incidents. Mr. Sotheby’s Epic, which very
<lb/>probably occupies the same ground, I believe I have never
<lb/>seen, and am sure that I never read.”</p><p></p><p>This we look upon as a very remarkable thing. How a
<lb/>poet, writing a Jong dramatic poem on the same theme, and
<lb/>with the same title and hero which have been already employ-
<lb break="no"/>ed by another, could have forborne (at least after the comple-
<lb break="no"/>tion of his own work) to peruse the work of his fellow-la-
<lb break="no"/>borer in the field, is to our apprehension, we say, a eery re-
<lb break="no"/>markable thing, and plainly shows Mr. Coxe to be a very re-
<lb break="no"/>markable man.</p><p></p><p>We have no faith in dramatic poems—they are paradoxical.
<lb/>What is poetical is not dramatic—what is dramatic is never
<lb/>poetical. “Saul,” however, is not entitled a “Dramatic
<lb/>Poem,” but a “ Mystery”—and if there is any thing in the
<lb/>World we detest, it is a mystery of any kind. We confess,
<lb/>therefore, that we proceed to the perusal of this book with
<lb/>a host of prejudice. We do not think we shall like it, and
<lb/>if we do not, we shall endeavor to say so, in the plainest of
<lb/>all possible terms.</p><p></p><p>In our next " Journal,” we shall review the poem in full.
<lb/>At present, we have time only to extract a peculiar passage,—
<lb/>the whole of the first scene of the fourth act.</p><p>Merodach. There crashed an avalanche,
From highest Libanus:
And ho ! another falls a-near,
Glancing a thousand moonbeams,
As the crystal rocks of ice,
Go thundering down below.
And hark! it is the mother-eagle screams,
As snaps the high branched pine,
And her nest and her brood are buried.
Far, far, in the valley below,
The peasant awakes in fear,
As he hears the alarum on high,
And the booming destruction comes down !
He wakes, and he prayeth his prayers;
The prayers that he prayeth are vain.
A mountain is piled on his roof and his home,
And the cry, and the crashing are still.
(Climbs higher.)
Earth, in these solitudes,
Makes bold to talk with God,
And lifts her head sublime to heaven,
Where breaks no mortal voice
On the long Sabbath of her quietness.
But spirits, where are ye
In icy fetters pining;
Ye who once chained the soul of Saul;
Ye whom the harp disarmed,
When David rallied his good angels,
To drag ye hither through the viewless ?
Spirits, say where !
(Pauses.)
If such the might of song;
</p><p>Ye too shall have enchanters
<lb/>Mimicking once more
<lb/>The spell of Moses’ rod:</p><p>And Pytho shall be praised upon the lyre,
Loud as the Hebrew’s Lord.
A blind old man shall be
To roam the sunny islands,
That float upon the sea,
And on their hills, and on their valleys,
Forever, shall his song enshrine
A fair idolatry.
(Climbs higher.)
Enchantress hear'st me not,
That calledst me afar?
I come to bid the spirits back again,
And seven beside, more strong.
Their harper foe is gone forever,
And Saul is thine once more.
Say witch, where art thou ?
Come on !
Merodach.	Ah, Magdiel, art thou there ?
Voice. Ay, teaching the new seven. Did ye hear
The snowballs that we bowled upon your head?
Never too Late. By Charles Burdett. New York. D. Appleton, &amp; Co. Be-
ing of a second series of tales for the people.
</p><p>One of those simple little tales of every day life, written to enforce a
<lb/>pious lesson, which always proves popular, and is doubtless found
<lb/>conducive to the object aimed at. Mr. Burdett is already favorably
<lb/>known as the author of two or three other books of the same class.
<lb/>It is published in a neat style, uniform with the well known “ series of
<lb/>for the people," issued by the same publishers.</p><p>THE MAGAZINES.
The Knickerbocker.
Democratic Review.
Hunt’s Merchant’s Magazine.
American Review and Whig Magazine.—(Colton.)
</p><p>The Knickerbocker presents its customary variety in its
<lb/>table of contents besides a grand piece de resistance, com-
<lb break="no"/>posed of A. Pike, and its Editor’s table the usual variety of
<lb/>pleasant gossip. We are sorry to see that Mr. Clark has in-
<lb break="no"/>volved himself in a quarrel with Mr. Hudson, and more so
<lb/>that he should have found anything in our own columns that
<lb/>by transplanting will wear an appearance of hostility to that
<lb/>gentleman. Our remarks, which the Editor of the Knick-
<lb break="no"/>erbocker has quoted, were meant to apply solely to Mr.
<lb/>Hudson’s manner, and not to his matter, for we had not
<lb/>heard enough of his lectures to enable us to form an opinion
<lb/>of his views of his subject; but we were strongly impressed
<lb/>with a feeling of respect for Mr. Hudson’s opinions, from the
<lb/>little that we did hear.</p><p></p><p>The feature of the Democratic Review is an essay on
<lb/>education by Mr. Hudson, from which the public may form
<lb/>a correct idea of his style and thoughts. Many who have
<lb/>long been in the habit of calling all New-Englanders reform-
<lb break="no"/>ers and transcendentalists, will be struck with his strong Con-
<lb break="no"/>servatism. Mr. Hudson has constantly an eye to the
<lb/>future, like the majority of his countrymen, but he also keeps
<lb/>an eye fixed steadily upon the past. He believes in the good
<lb/>old times. The Democratic has several admirable articles
<lb/>besides Mr. Hudson’s. The Essayist on English letter writers
<lb/>from the time of Howell to Lamb, makes a very singular
<lb/>omission in leaving Horace Walpole out of his Catalogue.
<lb/>This is like leaving Shakspeare out of the list of English
<lb/>Dramatists, or Fielding from the Catalogue of Novelists.
<lb/>Walpole is the only Englishman whose letters form the
<lb/>circulating portion of his works. We read the letters of other
<lb/>authors on account of their other productions : but we read
<lb/>Walpole’s works, because we have read his letters. We
<lb/>have extracted a good part of the Essay on writing for the
<lb/>Magazines, for its genial humor and magazinity, into ano-
<lb break="no"/>ther part of our columns. The portrait of the Democratic for
<lb/>this month is a striking likeness of McDuffie, of South Caro-
<lb break="no"/>lina, copied from a daguerreotype.</p><p></p><p>Hunt's Magazine has a translation from M. Coquelin,
<lb/>by Henry C. Carey, of Philadelphia, on the Commercial
<lb/>Associations of France and England, a paper on the Erie
<lb/>Canal Enlargement, by J. B. Jervis, of New-York, on the
<lb/>Corn Trade of the United Stales, by Charles Hudson, of
<lb/>Massachusetts, a review of the Exploring Expedition, and
<lb/>a great amount of of statistical matter.</p><p></p><p>The American Review, Mr. Colton's Whig Magazine,
<lb/>is almost a duplicate of the Democratic Review excepting
<lb/>the complexion of its politics. The first article, by Dr.
<lb/>Bacon “ The Mystery of Iniquity,” is forcibly written, and
<lb/>infinitely more exciting than any of the ‘mysteries’, not </p><p>excepting Saul, that have recently been published. It reads
</p><p>very much like a chapter from the mysteries of Paris. The
<lb/>paper by Mr. Hudson “on reading” will do very well as a Se-
<lb break="no"/>qaul to one on Education in the Democratic. It is worth</p><p></p><p>an infinite number of such Essays as that by Pycroft, a cheap
<lb/>edition of which has recently been published. The review
<lb/>of the ‘ Vestiges of Creation,’ is the most vigorous attack
<lb/>that has yet been made on that much abused and much be-
<lb break="no"/>praised work. The embellishment of the Whig Review, is</p><p></p><p>a portrait of John Quincy Adams, neither very commenda-
<lb break="no"/>ble as a portrait or as a work of art. The biographi-
<lb break="no"/>cal sketch of the old-man-eloquent, as the country news-
<lb break="no"/>papers will persist in calling the venerable ex-President,
<lb/>contains an extract from his diary when he was twenty-five</p><p>years old, which will let him down in the eyes of good
people several rounds on the ladder of fame.
    Taking them together, these four works exhibit a higher
</p><p>reach in the department of magazine literature, than the
<lb/>country has ever offered before. While the three dollar
<lb/>magazine, cheap and flashy, flourish best in Philadelphia,</p><p>the five dollar ones thrive best in New York ; indeed it is
the only place, except Richmond, Va., where one has ever
thrived at all. But there is still room for another to administer
<pb n="298"/>
</p><p>to tastes and preserve interests, which the others neglect.
<lb/>No magazine in this country has yet done anything for the
<lb/>interests of art, but there is a growing appetite in tne Ameri-
<lb break="no"/>can people for works of artistic excellence, which we trust
<lb/>that some intelligent publisher will before long turn to a
<lb/>profitable account.</p><p></p><p>Blackwood.—Mess. Leonard, Scott &amp; Co. have issued the April
<lb/>number of Blackwood. It cont .ins eight papers of varied excellence,
<lb/>but all good. “ Ping-Kee’s view of the stage” is piquant exceeding,
<lb/>ly, and North’s Account of Dryden (although disfigured with the usu-
<lb break="no"/>al carelessness and rant of Wilson) is an admirable essay. The con-
<lb break="no"/>tinuation of the papers called “ Confessions of an Opium Eater” is
<lb/>better, we think, than the original—which was a lie throughout.
<lb/>There is yet room for a book on opium eating, which shall be the
<lb/>most profoundly interesting volume ever penned. It would be written,
<lb/>however, by no De Quincy.</p><p>NEW WORKS IN PRESS.

<lb/>his thought should prove a fact. He thinks that Eothen was
<lb/>composed upon the plan of the Amber Witch and Lady Wil-,
<lb/>loughby’s Diary, and that the success of the former work led
<lb/>to the composition of Eothen. We copy a part of his re-;
<lb/>marks, which are certainly very plausible.</p><p></p><p>We are more than half inclined to suspect that the success of the
<lb/>Amber Witch has provoked the really clever writer of Eothen to test,
<lb/>by a like experiment, the boasted infallibility of the English Review-
<lb break="no"/>ers. Sparkling as most of the sketches in Eothen are, there is not
<lb/>from beginning to end a single passage that could not have been writ-
<lb break="no"/>ten by a man of vivid imagination—such as the writer evidently pos-
<lb break="no"/>sesses__without removing from his library. Hundreds of writers of</p><p></p><p>works, avowedly fictitious, display quite as much of graphic fidelity
<lb/>to nature in describing scenery, costumes and manners, with which
<lb/>they have no other acquaintance than through books.</p><p></p><p>The reader of Eothen will note that the author carefully avoids all
<lb/>ticklish ground, and never ventures upon any description the fidelity
<lb/>of which can be tested by actual observation. Thus his journey from
<lb/>Belgrade to Constantinople, his residence in that city, his visit to the
<lb/>plain of Troy, his description of Smyrna, &amp;c., although specimens of
<lb/>very beautiful writing, are yet so vague, shadowy, and indistinct, that
<lb/>of the thousands who have visited the same places none can say that
<lb/>this is true, this false, except in the general way that every well read
<lb/>man can make the same averment—We see the writer and read his
<lb/>reflections, but we see nothing of the East.</p><p></p><p>His visit to Lady Hester Stanhope is described with more particular-
<lb break="no"/>ity of detail, for the reason that on such a theme the writer felt him-
<lb break="no"/>self on safe ground. Lady Hester is dead, and so cannot contradict
<lb/>any statement he may make, and besides, she was so eccentric, saw
<lb/>so few travellers, and her mood so changed from time to time, that
<lb/>the writer of Eothen might let his fancy run riot in description, and</p><p>none could convict him of fiction. His adventures in Palestine, with
</p><p>descriptions of what he saw, could easily have been made up from
<lb/>books, and the hints derived from the conversation of friends who
<lb/>had actually visited the Holy Land. The whole of that portion looks
<lb/>like patch-work, made brilliant by the glow of a fervid imagination.</p><p></p><p>But we are willing to stake the whole argument on the chapter of
<lb/>“Cairo and the Plague.’' If any one can read that and verily believe
<lb/>the writer ever witnessed and passed through what he professes, he
<lb/>need not stagger at any thing. The same is true of what he says
<lb/>respecting the Pyramids, and that incredible, solitary ride on a drome-</p><p></p><p>dary, in the night, across the desert, to Suez.—Look, too, at Baalbec,
<lb/>despatched, literally, in a dozen lines of dreamy mystification, con-
<lb break="no"/>taining not one definite idea. We might go on with particulars, but
<lb/>these are enough to direct inquiry to the point we wish. The mock-
<lb break="no"/>ing tone in which much of the book is written, gives piquancy to it,
<lb/>while at the same time it suggests that the wicked writer was chuck-
<lb break="no"/>ling over the success of his scheme to mystify the Aristarchuses of the
<lb/>reviews. The view we have taken of the book in no way detracts from
<lb/>its literary merits, which are of a very high order; but what fun it
<lb/>will be to the writer to have so effectually mystified the erudite, elabo-
<lb break="no"/>rate, and solemn Quarterly, the keen, critical acumen of Blackwood,
<lb/>and the very respectable reading public generally ? We should like
<lb/>to have the opinions of our critical friends of the Mirror and the Broad-
<lb break="no"/>way Journal upon this matter.</p><p></p><p>If the travels of Bruce, published with his own name, and
<lb/>accompanied by numerous original drawings of the objects
<lb/>that he saw in his journeyings, were looked upon as apocry-
<lb break="no"/>phal, it would not be a strange matter if a book like Eothen,
<lb/>which has been published anonymously, should be regarded
<lb/>as a fiction. But its authenticity has never been doubted in
<lb/>England, where the author must be well known. Its author-
<lb break="no"/>ship has been attributed to a barrister named Trevilian, and
<lb/>we have no doubt that it is a perfectly true book. The beau-
<lb break="no"/>ty of the style, the light-hearted novelesque manner of the
<lb/>narrative, and the absence of such statistical matter as we
<lb/>generally find in books of travel, all help to give it an air of
<lb/>romance. But these are just the points which a good artist,
<lb/>like the author of Eothen, would have regarded, and to make
<lb/>his book appear true, he would have introduced some of the
<lb/>characteristics of other true books ; as the author of the Am-
<lb break="no"/>ber Witch has done. But its originality is one of the strong-
<lb break="no"/>est evidences of its genuineness. Nothing could be more
<lb/>easy than to get up, without leaving one’s library, a book of
<lb/>Eastern travel that would thoroughly deceive the public ; but
<lb/>only a very great artist could have hit upon the novel idea
<lb/>of practising a deception by framing a work unlike any other
<lb/>that had ever appeared on the same subject, and instead of
<lb/>using the same materials which others had brought from
<lb/>the east, to reject them altogether. But it would be impos-
<lb break="no"/>sible for the author to take his reader to a region which he
<lb/>had never visited himself. Eothen brings the east to us
<lb/>more vividly than any other eastern traveller has done ; such
<lb/>spots as Baalbec are hurriedly and dreamily sketched, be-
<lb break="no"/>cause other travellers had described them minutely. There
<lb/>is a minuteness of honesty in many parts of Eothen, which
<lb/>appears exceedingly like the work of an ingenious artist ra-
<lb break="no"/>ther than the effect of an ingenuous mind ; but they are few,
<lb/>and the marks of sincerity and honesty are many. We read
<lb/>the work with entire faith, satisfied that if the author were
<lb/>not a true traveller, he was in the highest degree a true
<lb/>artist.	____________________</p><p>BOBUS SMITH.
</p><p>It is not generally known to American readers, that the Rev. Syd-
<lb break="no"/>ney Smith had a brother who was nearly as bright a genius as the
<lb/>great wit himself. Robert Smith, commonly called Bobus by his
<lb/>friends, died just a fortnight after the decease of his elder and more fa-
<lb break="no"/>mous brother. We find the following biographical notice in the last
<lb/>number of the London Critic, the new weekly review which defends the
<lb/>cause of Young England ;</p><p></p><p>“It has very recently fallen to our lot to attempt some com-
<lb break="no"/>memoration of the life, character, and genius of the late Rev.
<lb/>Sydney Smith. We little apprehended at the time that we
<lb/>should so soon afterwards be called upon to record the death
<lb/>of his brother, elder by one year, Robert Smith, Esq., which
<lb/>took place on the day fortnight after the other. These two
<lb/>| most remarkable men had always entertained a strong degree
<lb/>| of reciprocal attachment and admiration for each other; but
<lb/>the life of the elder had, especially of late years, been so com-
<lb break="no"/>paratively withdrawn from the more prominent scenes of
<lb/>business and society, that we have little doubt that we shall
<lb/>surprise the larger proportion of our readers by affirming that,
<lb/>while the younger justly attracted an ampler share of the
<lb/>public notice by the more active part he bore in questions</p><p><pb n="299"/>
</p><p>and measures affecting the public welfare, and while in a 
<lb/>species of inspiration which he imparted to mirth and wit, 
<lb/>though by no means his most valuable characteristic, he, 
<lb/>among the men of his own, and perhaps of any time, may 
<lb/>with truth be pronounced inimitable; at the same time, we 
<lb/>believe that the most discerning of the contemporaries who 
<lb/>were happy enough to enjoy the friendship of both—we are 
<lb/>sure that the lamented Sydney himself—would in extent of 
<lb/>acquirement, in original force of thought, in mastery of mind,
<lb/>have given the palm to Robert, or to call him by the name 
<lb/>he inherited from the happy familiarity of early days, Bobus 
<lb/>Smith.</p><p></p><p>“We cannot pretend to give a full or accurate account of his
<lb/>life. He was born iu 1770. At Eton he was the intimate 
<lb/>associate of Canning, Frere, and Lord Holland, and a contri-
<lb break="no"/>butor to the Microcosm. At Cambridge he materially added 
<lb/>to the reputation for scholarship and classical composition
<lb/>which he had established at school; and if the most fastidi-
<lb break="no"/>ous critic of our day would diligently peruse the three
<lb/>Triposes which he composed in Lucretian rhythm, on the
<lb/>three systems of Plato, Descartes, and Newton, we believe 
<lb/>that we should not run the least risk of incurring the charge
<lb/>of exaggeration, in declaring our belief that these composi-
<lb break="no"/>tions in Latin verse have not been excelled since Latin was 
<lb/>a living language. Be this said with the peace of Milton and
<lb/>Cowley—with the peace of his fellow Etonians, Grey and
<lb/>Lord Wellesley.</p><p></p><p>“We are not aware that we can refer to any subsequent
<lb/>compositien by Mr. Smith which could be put on a level with
<lb/>these youthful effusions. We should, indeed, imagine that
<lb/>no person with his powers of intellect had ever published so
<lb/>little. Nor were his achievements in active public life, from
<lb/>the same fastidious aversion to display, though by no means 
<lb/>wanting in usefulness, at all commensurate with the ideas
<lb/>conceived of him by every one that approached him. He was
<lb/>nine years in Bengal as Advocate General, and one short ex-
<lb break="no"/>tract from Sir James Macintosh’s Diary may show the value
<lb/>entertained for him there:—“I hear frequently of Bobus; al-
<lb break="no"/>ways merry and always kind. Long live Bobus !”	</p><p></p><p>We believe his acquaintances were disposed to form bril-
<lb break="no"/>liant auguries of what he was likely to effect as a speaker in
<lb/>Parliament. His first essay, in 1812, is supposed not to have
<lb/>come up at least to the mark of his own fastidious judgment,
<lb/>and he seldom afterwards addressed the House at any length,
<lb/>or upon subjects which excited the contest and passions of
<lb/>parties. He rendered, however, really eminent services as
<lb/>a most diligent and pains-taking member of committees,
<lb/>which might have put many an idle mediocrity to the blush.
<lb/>He finally retired from Parliament in 1826. He spent the re-
<lb break="no"/>mainder of his life in comparative retirement, in the serene
<lb/>enjoyment of the various literature he loved, and the cheer-
<lb break="no"/>ful intercourse of the restricted society that delighted him.
<lb/>Nothing can be imagined more rich and racy in its variety
<lb/>of material, and in its force of reflection, than his conversa-
<lb break="no"/>tion. “ Pourquoi ne parlez-vous comme-ca dans la Cham-
<lb break="no"/>bre des Communes?" said Madame de Stael to him one day,
<lb/>after listening for some time to its eloquent flow; though
<lb/>there was in it nothing of the harangue, in its manly ease
<lb/>and simplicity it partook of his character; there was much
<lb/>in him of the sturdy Saxon combined with the refined and
<lb/>thoroughly finished scholar. No one was ever so clear of all
<lb/>frippery, and the only thing for which he probably felt no
<lb/>toleration was a prig. Of his conversation Mr. Canning said
<lb/>“Bobus's language is the essence of English.”</p><p></p><p>In his inner domestic life he was full of gentle and attach-
<lb break="no"/>ing qualities. He married Caroline Vernon, daughter of
<lb/>Richard Vernon, esq. and Evelyn, Countess of Upper Ossory.
<lb/>He lost a son and a daughter in their prime of youth, each of
<lb/>most rare promise. His eldest son, and only surviving
<lb/>child, is the Right Hon. R. Vernon Smith, M. P. for North-
<lb break="no"/>ampton.</p><p></p><p>Professor Gouraud.—The following extract from the
<lb/>Professor's lecture on Memory, is a remarkable instance of
<lb/>fluent writing in a foreigner, who, three or four years since,
<lb/>was almost ignorant of our languge. M. Gouraud’s style
<lb/>is somewhat too luxuriant for these days of classic severity,
<lb/>but it has wonderful ease as the production of a foreigner.</p><p></p><p>Already have the birds of night, preceded by the white-winged owl,
<lb/>who seems to serve them as a warning beacon, begun to regain their
<lb/>obscure retreats in the shadowy depths of the forests: the timid hare</p><p>
and cautious deer have already left the open fields for the more propi-
</p><p>tious shadow of the woods. At their return, the implacable eagle and
<lb/>the voracious hawk begin to prepare anew their sharp talons for the
<lb/>morning’s hunt; while, disengaging their heads from underneath the
<lb/>warm wings which covered them during the night, the birds of day
<lb/>among whom they must soon choose again their prey, little foreseeing
<lb/>the cruel fate which may and which must before long overtake them,
<lb/>open their eyes, shuffle their glossy feathers, and begin to hop from
<lb/>branch to branch, as if to stretch their little limbs, and prepare their
<lb/>light wings for flight.	</p><p></p><p>All at once, the air rings with a melodious sound, which causes the
<lb/>atmosphere to vibrate afar, with a sweet and tremulous thrill; the
<lb/>echo, hitherto silent, repeats it in successive adulations to the distant
<lb/>streamlet of the valley. Immediately cadencing a harmonious rou-
<lb break="no"/>lade, which seems to run over a thousand varied notes at once the
<lb/>fairy voice which produced these ravishing sounds awakens all the
<lb/>surrounding echoes, and they repeat it in chorus—while the voice itself
<lb/>seems to pause, as if, submerged in the torrent of harmonies with
<lb/>which she has filled the atmosphere, she were listening to herself in
<lb/>rapturous astonishment. At these enchanting accents, the joyous
<lb/>troop are suddenly arrested, as if under the infatuation of a spell to
<lb/>listen also; for they have recognised the harmonious ringing notes of
<lb/>the lyric enchantress of the groves, the morning leader of the song-
<lb break="no"/>sters of the forest—the melodious nightingale ! who, already prelu-
<lb break="no"/>ding at her morning concerts, offers thus abruptly her first salutations
<lb/>to Aurora, always attentive to her songs. It would seem indeed that
<lb/>her melodious notes had been carried by the surrounding echoes even
<lb/>to the carminated gates of the horizon, and were understood by the
<lb/>elements; for Aurora at the moment seems to have redoubled her
<lb/>pace. The birds, preluding already to the harmonies of their matin
<lb/>hymns, seem to prepare themselves for singing her triumphs. At
<lb/>their head is the rustic cuckoo, the gay linnet, the lively red-breast
<lb/>and the sensitive turtle-dove. The nightingale by their side, presiding
<lb/>t over the concert, redoubles her harmonious cadences, as the Goddess
<lb/>of the dawn approaches. Most of the stars have vanished from the
<lb/>firmament; the heavens now appear like an ocean of shining gold and
<lb/>liquid gems of a thousand hues. And now Aurora reigns in undisputed
<lb/>sovereignty. But, alas! “ a natural image of pleasure: as nothing is
<lb/>more beautiful than her reign, so nothing is shorter than its duration.”</p><p></p><p>The god of day follows her with hasty steps ; she must soon resign
<lb/>her empire, like the night, which just now fled so rapidly before her.
<lb/> In vain the hours, with redoubled energy, scatter in precipitated floods</p><p>their bouquets of roses beneath her steps; she must finally yield—the
</p><p>god of day has almost overtaken her ! Already he is announced by
<lb/>the more vivid tints which he pours around him. The glowing rays
<lb/>but just precede the dazzling glare; the east seems on fire : it appears
<lb/>suddenly all in flames. At their effulgency, the burning disc is each
<lb/>moment expected ; at every instant he seems about to appear—at last
<lb/>he rises majestically from the liquid abyss! A brilliant pencil of
<lb/>flame, starting forth like a flash of lightning, and suddenly filling all
<lb/>space, seems, like the bow of a celestial orchestra, to have given the
<lb/>last signal for the awakening of all nature. It is the Sun, who has</p><p>just touched upon the horizon with the edge of his inflamed disc.—
</p><p>Red as a purpuereal sphere of gleaming Vermillion, and at first of an
<lb/>immense size, he gradually ascends from behind a wide-spreading
<lb/>curtain of clouds, which he soon pierces with a thousand pencils of
<lb/>light, forming a gigantic glory, whose superior rays curve themselves
<lb/>into an immense arch, which reaches to the zenith. “ Then the veil
<lb/>of darkness being entirely effaced, man is again permitted to recog-
<lb break="no"/>nise his abode, which he finds everywhere beautified and embellished.
<lb/>The verdure has taken during the night fresh vigor and renewed fresh-
<lb break="no"/>ness ; the new-born day which shines upon it, the first rays which gild
<lb/>it display it covered with a brilliant net-work of dew, which reflects
<lb/>to the eye the light and the colors of the rainbow !”</p><p></p><p>The merry troop is again arrested to contemplate with ecstatic feel-
<lb break="no"/>ings the glorious spectacle, which has been thus gradually developed
<lb/>before them. Meanwhile all nature has been awakened, at that sub-
<lb break="no"/>lime moment,—when the disc of the sun touched lightly upon the
<lb/>horizon—the birds were re-united in chorus, and now they cause all
<lb/>the echoes of their melodious warblings to resound in concert. Not
<lb/>one remains silent; their musical songs, feeble at first, are more ten-
<lb break="no"/>der and sweet than during the remainder of the day—they seem as if</p><p>tinged with the softness and mellow ness of a languid awakening.—
</p><p>Imitating their merry concerts, the insects hum beneath the grass ;
<lb/>the fishes in the streams dart along the surface of the water, and leap
<lb/>with jov, sparkling in the light with their silver scales; the reptiles
<lb/>crawl from their dark and humid holes, and come to bask in the warm
<lb/>sun-light ; and even the serpent himself, raising up his hideous head
<lb/>above his spiral coils, and darting out his scarlet longue, unable to sing
<lb/>praises hisses forth bis ceaseless curse ! Every thing, finally, is exci-
<lb break="no"/>ted and moved throughout all nature; every thing breathes joy and
<lb/>happiness at the first rays of the rising Sun—and the planets them-
<lb break="no"/>selves do they not bound forward in their empyreal course more
<lb/>rapidly and more animatedly as they approach him nearer and nearer</p><p></p><p>But to speak only of things more accessible to the observer; at
<lb/>his appearance the camel of the desert is said to kneel while turning
<lb/>himself towards the east; the eagle stretches broad his extended
<lb/>wings, while fixing his piercing eye upon his burning disc ; and the
<lb/>elephant salutes him with his flexible proboscis: or rather, do not
<lb/>all the animals salute in his image, by an irresistible impulse, in this
<lb/>universal concert and by these testimonials of respect and gladness,
<lb/>HIM of whom the Sun is but the shadow ?-the universal Father and
<lb/>Benefactor, above all empyreal suns ! And yet, “ although the con-
<lb break="no"/>course of all these objects carries to the sense an impression of fresh-
<lb break="no"/>ness which seems to penetrate even to the soul,” man alone, of all
<lb/>created beings, almost always forgets himself in presence of a spec-</p><p>tacle so majestic and sublime! . . . . . . .	
Soon the laborers resume their wonted toils; the flocks and herds
are reconducted to the fields; the butterflies begin to flit from flower
<pb n="300"/>

</p><p>to flower, the bees of the neighbouring trees come to dispute with
<lb/>them for the sweet ambrosia of their streaming nectaria ; the lady-
<lb break="no"/>birds leave their rosy couches ; the gilded day-beetles quit their pro-
<lb break="no"/>tecting recesses, while those of the night regain their mossy cells.
<lb/>The nocturnal flowers fold their humid petals, while the blossoms of
<lb/>the day unfold their fresh corollas. The dew evaporates beneath
<lb/>the increasing heat of the Sun, whose vivifying influence, animating
<lb/>all nature, infuses life, vigor, and gladness into every particle of
<lb/>matter, into every sensitive bosom.......</p><p>ANNIVERSARY WEEK.
</p><p>In addition to the usual religious societies which hold their
<lb/>anniversaries in this city during the second week in May,
<lb/>we have this season a convention of Infidels, whose meetings
<lb/>are held in a small brick building in Broadway called the
<lb/>Coliseum. The city was startled at the sight of placards on
<lb/>the corners of all the principal streets, headed Infidel Con-
<lb break="no"/>vention, notifying the people that a meeting of infidels would
<lb/>be held at certain hours during Sunday. We like the hon-
<lb break="no"/>esty of these people, in proclaiming their Infidelity, although
<lb/>it appears that the great man among them, Mr. Owen, ob-
<lb break="no"/>jected to the term, and preferred being called, a “ friend of uni-
<lb break="no"/>versal freedom and unlimited charity,” which is a very com-
<lb break="no"/>prehensive designation, but not a very forcible one. The
<lb/>Tribune makes some strange comments upon this convention,
<lb/>which we do not fully comprehend, but they appear to us
<lb/>highly commendatory. “ Saying nothing of the influence of
<lb/>belief,” says the paper, “ who can doubt that the isolated condi-
<lb break="no"/>tion of all infidels, their independence of the restraining influ-
<lb break="no"/>ence of sympathy and fellowship are clearly unfavorable to
<lb/>high moral attainments? We rejoice, then, that they have
<lb/>resolved to know each other, and fix upon some definite and
<lb/>endearing plan of organization and action.”</p><p></p><p>This is surely very distinct and unequivocal. A paper
<lb/>possessing the immense circulation of the Tribune, which is
<lb/>taken in many pious families for the reason that it excludes
<lb/>theatrical advertisements, and other wicked matter from its
<lb/>columns, is rejoiced that the infidels in this country have had
<lb/>the shrewdness to adopt the machinery by which other class-
<lb break="no"/>es of men contrive to strengthen themselves in their errors,
<lb/>and trusts that they may fix upon some plan for rendering
<lb/>their infidelity enduring. The want of “high moral at-
<lb break="no"/>tainments” among infidels, the Tribune attributes to the
<lb/>isolated manner in which they have heretofore lived, and
<lb/>thinks that by meeting together frequently, and adopting the
<lb/>machinery of a party, whereby they may become more thor-
<lb break="no"/>oughly imbued with infidelity, that their morals will be im-
<lb break="no"/>proved. The morality and the reasoning of the Tribune are
<lb/>decidedly original, and we would advise the proprietors to
<lb/>get out a patent for them.</p><p></p><p>It appears that Mrs. Rose, the somewhat celebrated clair-
<lb break="no"/>voyante, a Polish lady, who resides in this city, was among
<lb/>the speakers at the Coliseum, and that Judge Herttell was
<lb/>appointed chairman. The Tribune says that Robert Owen
<lb/>addressed the meeting briefly and sensibly, and of the con-
<lb break="no"/>vention it expresses the belief that “ an elevation of the aims
<lb/>and an improvement of the morals of many will be the con-
<lb break="no"/>sequence.” The Tribune, according to its manner of reason-
<lb break="no"/>ing in the premises, would be rejoiced to see a convention of
<lb/>counterfeiters or pickpockets, or horse thieves, for the isolated
<lb/>manner in which these people live is very destructive to the
<lb/>social sympathies, and “ devotion to their party or sex, soli-
<lb break="no"/>citude for us welfare, and pride in its respectability would
<lb/>make them behave better than they otherwise would.”</p><p></p><p>The wisdom of conventions, even for professedly benevo-
<lb break="no"/>lent purposes, is very questionable, but there can be no ques-
<lb break="no"/>tion of the evil which must result from party machinery,
<lb/>being adopted by men whose sole object is to bind them-
<lb break="no"/>selves in a compact of infidelity.</p><p></p><p>No less than twenty-three different associations, mostly
<lb/>religious, have held their anniversaries during the week.
<lb/>Among the societies, we perceive one of a winning title, the
<lb/>“National Reform Association.” We should suppose that
<lb/>everybody would be anxious to enrol themselves among its
<lb/>members ; yet it appears that only twenty-five persons
<lb/>gathered together at its anniversary, which, after all, is
<lb/>about the number of men in the country who are favorable
<lb/>to National Reform. The Foreign Evangelical Society can
<lb/>number its thousands of members. Our Charity is not one</p><p>of the domestic virtues; she begins abroad, and, in many
cases ends there.
</p><p>In New Haven there has been a grand gathering of Scientific
<lb/>Gentlemen during the last week, and much important infor-
<lb break="no"/>mation has been disseminated, and many curious discoveries
<lb/>made public. One of the members discovered a fossil pun,
<lb/>which seemed to afford the association a vast amount of
<lb/>pleasure, it being probably the first discovery of the kind
<lb/>ever made.</p><p></p><p>Somebody gave an account of marks which had been
<lb/>found on a rock, resembling the human foot without toes, or a
<lb/>foot with the toes frozen off. Professor Silliman, junior re-
<lb break="no"/>marked that it had long been a no-toe-rious fact.</p><p>THE CROSSING’S SWEEPER.
With unkempt hair, and shoeless feet,
The untitled sov’reign of the street,
With broom in hand,
Of charity may crave a mite,—
Pass him not by, it is a sight
He may command.
Pass him not by without a sign,
You recognize the shape divine
In him, though poor;
Kind words, if not a coin, will soothe,
And make his rugged pathway smooth,
More than before.
Pass him not by ! Ye know not men,
But God with his omniscient ken
Has placed him there,
To make his country’s annals bright,
When the plebeian claims his right
And spurns despair.
Ay! ’neath that tattered, brimless hat,
May rest a spirit great as that
Which shook the world,
And bent all Europe to its rod,
While kings who ruled by grace of God,
From thrones were hurled.
A time may come when ’neath a sky,
Brighter than that dark canopy,
That shades him now;
He yet may stand to clear your way,
And pointing out a brighter day,
Enwreathe his brow.
The head now pillowing on a stone,
Despised, uncared for, and lone,
May one day rise,
High plumed on its eagle wings,
To sit above your sceptred kings,
Eloquent, wise !	s. A. W-
MUSICAL ITEMS.
</p><p>The Bcehm Flute.—We rarely have the good fortune to
<lb/>be able to chronicle one really useful improvement in music-
<lb break="no"/>al instruments; numberless modern inventions come under
<lb/>our notice daily, but they are, for the most part, if not entire-
<lb break="no"/>ly, valueless—of but little practical advantage.</p><p></p><p>The Boehm Flute is, however, a noble exception; we
<lb/>look upon it as the most valuable improvement ever effected
<lb/>in this instrument; and we believe, although there is no
<lb/>limit to the ingenuity of the human intellect, that it brings
<lb/>the flute as near perfection as it ever will be. It not only
<lb/>renders every scale of the instrument comparatively easy,
<lb/>but it ensures, beyond every contingency, that every scale
<lb/>shall be in perfect tune. It renders also the upper and the
<lb/>lower tones very easy to produce, while it improves and
<lb/>equalizes the tone throughout. Passages which were im
<lb/>practicable upon the old flute can be played with perfect fa</p><p><pb n="301"/>
</p><p>cility upon the Boehm flute, while, added to all these advan-
<lb break="no"/>tages, and many more advantages which we shall take an
<lb/>early opportunity of pointing out to amateur and profession-
<lb break="no"/>al players, the exterior appearance of the flute is much im-
<lb break="no"/>proved and beautified.</p><p></p><p>A strong feeling of prejudice was exhibited against the
<lb/>Boehm innovation, as it was arrogantly called, by profession-
<lb break="no"/>al players, both here and in Europe; but its striking advan-
<lb break="no"/>tages and sterling excellence silenced them one by one, and
<lb/>the Boehm flute is now universally adopted.</p><p></p><p>To Mr. W. J. Davis, the talented flutist, every honor must
<lb/>be given as the first man who had the boldness to introduce
<lb/>it into this country ; and to Mr. Larrabee, the ingenious ma-
<lb break="no"/>ker, the public and the professors owe a debt of gratitude for
<lb/>his sacrifice of self-interest, in substituting the new for the
<lb/>old flute.</p><p></p><p>We hope that all who are interested in this subject, and
<lb/>have not yet examined the Boehm flute, may be induced by
<lb/>our notice to visit Mr. Larrabee’s factory, 110 Fulton street.
<lb/>We have examined the instrument thoroughly, and can vouch
<lb/>for its excellence in every way.</p><p></p><p>Grand Sacred Concert at St. Peter’s Church.—We call the
<lb/>attention of our readers to the advertisement of this Concert in our
<lb/>present number. It will be seen that a truly classical and yet popu-
<lb break="no"/>lar programme is offered on this occasion. The selections are from
<lb/>the finest composers, ancient and modern. Mozart, Handel, Hayden,
<lb/>Mendelssohn, Rossini and other names of note, give warranty of the
<lb/>excellence of the selection. The solos and chorusses from St. Paul
<lb/>will be new to most of our readers. As an entire work, Paulus is un’
<lb/>doubtedly the greatest work that Mendelssohn has yet produced; for,
<lb/>lofty sentiment, profound thought, and exquisite melody, no recent 
<lb/>composition has approached it. The Loblgesang has also, only once
<lb/>been produced in this country, and the selections from it cannot fail to
<lb/>add the charm of novelty to the programme.</p><p></p><p>Mrs. Edward Loder, Miss De Luce, Miss Schmidt, Miss Watson,
<lb/>and Mr. Masset sustain the principal parts, while the chorus, com-
<lb break="no"/>posed principally of the members of the New-York Vocal Society, so
<lb/>favourably known to the public, is announced to be full and effective.
<lb/>It will be under the direction of Mr. H. C. Watson.</p><p></p><p>Mr. William A. King, organist of St. Peter’s, whose reputation in
<lb/>that department is widely spread throughout the States, is engaged
<lb/>to get the concert up. Mr. H. C. Timm performs with Mr. W. A
<lb/>King a four-handed piece for the organ.</p><p></p><p>The Concert is for the benefit of the Funds of the Church, which, 
<lb/>independent of the musical attraction will doubtless be sufficient to
<lb/>fill the Church.</p><p>THE BROADWAY THEATRE.
</p><p>Mr. Hamblin has made a very touching appeal to the citi-
<lb break="no"/>zens of New York, and proposes borrowing one hundred
<lb/>thousand dollars, in the ridiculously small sums (as Mr. Tigg
<lb/>would say) of one dollar, from the same number of individu-
<lb break="no"/>als, for which he will issue scrip entitling subscribers to a
<lb/>dollar’s worth of admissions to his theatre when it shall be
<lb/>finished. This is certainly a very ingenious scheme for rais-
<lb break="no"/>ing a hundred thousand dollars ; but without a particle of ill
<lb/>will towards Mr. Hamblin, whom we have not the pleasure
<lb/>of knowing, we cannot say that we wish he may get it. For 
<lb/>we should regret exceedingly to see a theatre erected in
<lb/>Broadway, more especially such a theatre as Mr. Hamblin 
<lb/>would probably put up. Considering the effect which thea-
<lb break="no"/>tres invariably have in the neighborhood where they have
<lb/>been built, we should expect that the owners of property in
<lb/>Broadway would protest against the erection of one in that
<lb/>noble thoroughfare. The little Olympic is probably the best
<lb/>conducted theatre in the city ; but we see it surrounded by
<lb/>dram shops, billiard rooms, and other equivocal resorts for</p><p></p><p>the profligate and idle. We see no necessity of making a
<lb/>theatre a drinking house, a gambling house, and a something
<lb/>else house, as well as a play house, but there seems to be the
<lb/>real unities of the drama, and pea-nuts and punch are as es-
<lb break="no"/>sential concomitants to the acting drama as tin foil and rouge.
<lb/>It is one of the strangest things in life, that every institution
<lb/>has been modified by time excepting the theatre. It is just
<lb/>as dissolute now as it was in the days of Charles the Second.
<lb/>Though governed by no laws, and its professors reckoned as
<lb/>vagrants, it is one of the most conservative institutions among
<lb/>us. Quakers and Jews change, but the theatre holds to its
<lb/>old usages. Mr. Simpson is the only man in New York who
<lb/>has remained unchanged during the past twenty years, and
<lb/>his theatre is the only building in the city which has not
<lb/>been renovated. All the churches have been remodeled;
<lb/>preachers have changed their style, their theology, and their
<lb/>habits; society has suffered a dozen revolutions; the whole
<lb/>order of living has been reversed; we have altered our food,
<lb/>drink, habits, and even our speech; cotillions have gone out,
<lb/>and the Polka has come in ; finger glasses and silver forks
<lb/>have become common in hotels; drunkenness has grown
<lb/>unfashionable; the national name has been changed; new
<lb/>streets have been built; Texas has been annexed; cheap
<lb/>books have been invented ; hanging is almost abolished; the
<lb/>Croton river runs through the streets ;—but Mr. Simpson and
<lb/>the Park remain the same, as unchangeable as the eternal
<lb/>sphinx of the desert. He looks as gloomy and saturnine as
<lb/>he used to look when he played Charles Surface in a claret
<lb/>colored coat and straw colored shorts ; and his theatre is as
<lb/>dingy, as English, and as expensive as ever. The filthy sa-
<lb break="no"/>loons, with their red moreen curtains and yellow refreshment
<lb/>sellers remain unchanged, and probably will remain so for
<lb/>the next century ; and the same plays are presented on the
<lb/>stage that were witnessed by our grandmothers and our
<lb/>grandmothers’ grandmothers. There is no church in Chris-
<lb break="no"/>tendom half so conservative as the theatre: there are isms
<lb/>in every thing but the drama, which has never known a
<lb/>schism. Mr. Dinneford, to be sure, got up a Greek tragedy
<lb/>the other day, which was stepping backward a thousand
<lb/>years or two, instead of moving forward, as any one must
<lb/>do who would produce a sensation in the drama ; and it ap-
<lb break="no"/>pears that he lost twenty-five hundred dollars by his devotion
<lb/>to the classics, which should be a caution to other managers
<lb/>to let the classics alone.</p><p></p><p>We have no reason to believe that Mr. Hamblin would
<lb/>break adrift from the legitimate drama, or that he would do
<lb/>any better in Broadway than he has heretofore done in the
<lb/>Bowery; and therefore we would rather see him fail than
<lb/>succeed in his present undertaking; not that we wish him
<lb/>any ill as an individual, but as a manager he cannot but do
<lb/>harm in the community. He has had a large theatre under
<lb/>his control for many years, but he has done nothing to ele-
<lb break="no"/>vate the drama or correct the corrupt tastes of his audiences.
<lb/>If Mr. Hamblin must have a theatre, let him by all means
<lb/>stick to the Bowery. He would be a fish out of water in
<lb/>Broadway, and his theatre would mar the beauty of our mag-
<lb break="no"/>nificent thoroughfare.</p><p></p><p>We shall have a theatre in New York by and by, we have
<lb/>no doubt, that will reflect the manners of the people and
<lb/>satirise their vices, but it must be under the control of a
<lb/>manager to the manor born.</p><p></p><p>We are sorry for Mr. Hamblin’s misfortunes, and would
<lb/>not put the slightest obstacle in his way to retrieve his loss-
<lb break="no"/>es ; and our remarks are only intended to apply to the erec-
<lb break="no"/>tion of a theatre in Broadway.</p><p><pb n="302"/>
Fact and Fiction.—From Thoughts on Reading, in Colton’s Mag-
azine, by H. N. Hudson, the Lecturer on Shakspeare:
</p><p>“ Good people often seem laboring under a great mistake
<lb/>in regard to works of fiction. They appear to think of truth
<lb/>as synonymous with matters of fact, and of fiction as synony- 
<lb/>mous with falsehood. Now, there is probably nothing that
<lb/>lies so frequently or so abominably as narratives of facts.
<lb/>Why, if a man wants to make any falsehood go down, he 
<lb/>always sweetens it with some “ fact whch came under his 
<lb/>own observation.” Facts, indeed, we know to be the readi-
<lb break="no"/>est vehicle of lies in the world : and whenever one under- 
<lb/>takes to inflict them on us, we take for granted that there is
<lb/>no truth in him; or that, if there be, it is not coming out
<lb/>this time. On the other hand, as some one has said, the
<lb/>purest fictions often contain more of truth than many histo-
<lb break="no"/>ries and scientific theories. In Spenser or Cervantes, for
<lb/>example, perhaps you shall not find a single falsehood, or a
<lb/>single fact; in a Gibbon or a Paley, you shall scarcely find a
<lb/>single fiction or a single truth. In the former, all shall be
<lb/>true but the names; in the latter all but the names shall be
<lb/>false. Take, for example, Addison’s Cato and Sancho Panza.
<lb/>Now, Cato is unquestionably a real name; nobody doubts
<lb/>the existence of such a man ; or that he was a genuine old,
<lb/>eating, breathing, thinking and speaking Roman, of the
<lb/>staunchest and noblest make. But Addison's Cato is one of
<lb/>the sheerest falsehoods that ever was perpetrated ; such a 
<lb/>being never did exist, and never could exist; all the princi- 
<lb/>ples of human nature must be changed before his existence
<lb/>were possible. Sancho Panza, on the contrary, is doubtless
<lb/>a fictitious name; nobody pretends that a real man ever bore
<lb/>that name ; but the character is a perfect form of truth ; is
<lb/>as real as the old Roman Cato was, whom Addison meant to 
<lb/>give us, but could not; wants, in short, all that Addison’s 
<lb/>Cato has, and has all that Addison’s Cato wants. And thus 
<lb/>it is, that, in the hands of an artist, a fiction becomes the 
<lb/>truest of realities, while, in the hands of a bungler, a fact
<lb/>becomes the emptiest of falsehoods.</p><p></p><p>Again ; take Spenser’s Una and Johnson’s Milton. Now,
<lb/>Una is a mere personification of truth—one of the purest ab-
<lb break="no"/>stractions which the mind can frame, and with which, as
<lb/>such, we could no more sympathize, than with a triangle or
<lb/>an octagon. And yet, in Spenser’s hands, it has turned out
<lb/>a fair humanity, breathing and blushing before us, like life
<lb/>itself. Uniting all the purity of an abstraction, with the
<lb/>flesh-and-blood reality of an actual person, we at once revere
<lb/>her as truth, and feel for her as the real subject of sympa-
<lb break="no"/>thies and affections answering to our own. Here, then, is a
<lb/>genuine character; a pure abstraction has come out a living
<lb/>person; a perfect fiction has become a perfect truth. This
<lb/>is the miracle that genius performs. Milton, on the contra-
<lb break="no"/>ry, is an actual person ; nay, he has stamped his individual-
<lb break="no"/>ity, as a full length portrait, on every page of his works, so
<lb/>that he who runs may read, provided he have eyes. In
<lb/>Johnson’s hands, however, he becomes a mere abstraction ;
<lb/>no longer he, but it ; or rather, a bundle of the mo t incon-
<lb break="no"/>sistent and irreconcilable abstractions. You could no more
<lb/>mould such elements into the same living character, than
<lb/>you could mix fire and water, without destroying either.—
<lb/>Here is a genuine fact turned into a perfect falsehood. This
<lb/>is the miracle that genius does not perform. We could
<lb/>multiply instances beyond either our time or the reader’s pa-
<lb break="no"/>tience. It is truth, in this sense, that forms the substance
<lb/>and the soul of all true books ; and we care not what form
<lb/>you give it, it is as genuine and as indestructible as the eye
<lb/>of God.	1</p><p>MISCELLANY.
It is an ill wind that blows nobodt good.—The frost
</p><p>has been so intense on the Danube, that rocks which for centuries had
<lb/>obstructed the navigation near Lintz, suddenly burst, and thus opened
<lb/>the bed of the river.</p><p></p><p>Bursting or Beer.—The famous brewers of Burton Ale,
<lb/>Messrs. Alsopps, whose names should be written Allslops, have re-
<lb break="no"/>cently failed for the moderate sum of one million and a half of dol-
<lb break="no"/>lars.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Murdoch, who has been successfully lecturing in
<lb/>this city upon the Drama and Shakspeare, will make his re-appearance
<lb/>upon the stage in September. He has an engagement at the Park for
<lb/>12 nights.</p><p></p><p>Three faces under a hood, viz. Palmo-hood.—The new
<lb/>opera house in Chambers street was first occupied by the Italians, then
<lb/>the Greeks, but now, it appears from the following notice, it is occu-
<lb break="no"/>pied by the Ethiopians.</p><p></p><p>“ Mr. Dumbleton has at length succeeded in obtaining possession
<lb/>from Palmo, of the Opera House, and will this evening open it with
<lb/>the Ethioipan Serenaders.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Henry Phillips gave his farewell concert at Niblo’s
<lb/>Saloon last Tuesday evening ; it was well attended, and the perfor-
<lb break="no"/>mances gave great satisfaction. Mr. Phillips sang twelve different
<lb/>ballads, scenas, &amp;c., many of which were encored, and all were well
<lb/>received. If he should repeat his visit to this country he would meet
<lb/>with better encouragement in the large cities on the Atlantic than he
<lb/>has done. His indifferent success has resulted mainly from an inju-
<lb break="no"/>dicious beginning in the manner of giving his concerts.</p><p>Historical Society.—At a very crowded meeting of this
</p><p>society on Wednesday evening, the Rev. Rufus W. Griswold read a
<lb/>long and interesting paper in reference to the intellectual history of
<lb/>the country—with criticisms on the works of several of our most noted
<lb/>authors. He did not conclude the essay.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Alters, the Musician.—We had an interesting article on the
<lb/>burial of this excellent musician, which is crowded out of this week’s
<lb/>Journal. He died last Saturday at the house of his friend Mr. Timm,
<lb/>and was buried from the Tabernacle Tuesday morning. The house
<lb/>was nearly filled by the members of the Philharmonic Society of
<lb/>which he was a member, and by his personal friends and pupils. The
<lb/>funeral ceremonies, of which we shall give the particulars, were high-
<lb break="no"/>ly impressive, and admirably adapted to the occasion.</p><p></p><p>The Mirror of last week contains a poem of much merit,
<lb/>entitled “ The Gazelle.’’ It is the composition of a mere boy of fif-
<lb break="no"/>teen, C. C. Cooke, and, although professedly an imitation of “ The
<lb/>Raven,” has a very great deal of original power.</p><p>NEW PUBLICATIONS.

MR. AND MRS. KIRKLAND’S
SCHOOL FOR YOUNG LADIES,
No. 255 Greene Street,
One door above Waverly Place, New York.
THIS School differs essentially from most others in
this city, in one particular: the number admitted is so limited that each

and every facility is afforded for practice, both in the school and in the family.
</p><p>The plan of instruction embraces three divisions. The Initiatory Course in-
<lb break="no"/>cludes Grammar, Geography, American History, Writing and Arithmetic,
<lb/>with Composition. Reading aloud, Spelling and Definition, form part of the
<lb/>daily exercises of the whole school.	</p><p>The Second continues the above-named studies, with the addition of An-
cient and Modern History and the French Language.
</p><p>In the higher or AEsthetic course all the usual branches of a thorough En-
<lb break="no"/>glish course of education are included, with French, German, Latin and
<lb/>Greek, according to the wish of the parent and the capacity of the scholar.
<lb/>Pupils in this course pay particular attention to Poetry, to the art of Com-
<lb break="no"/>position, and to the Philosophy of History. Moral Philosophy is taught from</p><p></p><p>Dymond, as abridged and prepared for schools by Mrs. Kirkland. Lectures
<lb/>on various subjects are delivered by Mr. and Mrs. Kirkland, and others; and
<lb/>the general course of study is advanced and rendered interesting by copious
<lb/>illustrations from French and English Literature.</p><p>TERMS.

BERTINI’S METHOD FOR THE PIANO.
THIS is the only thorough, complete and progressive
</p><p>work yet published in this country. Where pupils here used this method
<lb/>the most rapid advancement has been observed in all cases. The most prom-
<lb break="no"/>inent feature of this work is that the lessons, exercises, scales and studies, are
<lb/>given in such progressive order, that they enlist the interest of pupils, and
<lb/>carry them almost imperceptibly through those mechanical difficulties which,
<lb/>otherwise, are too often made irksome in other instruction books. The time
<lb/>has arrived when a superficial knowledge of the Piano is of but little account,
<lb/>and it is only by the study of such methods as Bertini’s that pupils will be en
<lb/>abled to READ music with facility, and at the same time become good musi-</p><p>cians.
</p><p> This method commences in the most plain and simple manner ; the rud-
<lb break="no"/>ments of music being given and illustrated at the same time, and each lesson
<lb/>is fully explained by marginal notes on the same page.</p><p></p><p>The publishers are in possession of the highest reccommendations from pro-
<lb break="no"/>fessional gentleman, who speak of the superior merits of Bertini’s Method
<lb/>over all others yet published in this country, most of them having used the
<lb/>foreign copies previously. It will only be necessary to give a few of the
<lb/>names in the principal cities.</p><p>New York.

</p><p>The above Periodicals are reprinted in New-York, immediately on their
<lb/>arrival by the British steamers, in a beautiful clear type, on fine white paper
<lb/>and are faithful copies of the originals—Blackwood’s Magazine being an ex-
<lb break="no"/>act fac-simile of the Edinburgh Edition.</p><p></p><p>The wide spread fame of these splendid Periodicals renders it needless to
<lb/>say much to their praise. As Literary organs, they stand far in advance of
<lb/>any works of a similar stamp now published, while their political complexion
<lb/>is marked by a dignity, candor, and forbearance not often found in works of
<lb/>a party character.</p><p></p><p>They embrace the views of the three great parties in England, Whig, Tory,
<lb/>and Radical. “Blackwood” and the “ London Quarterly ” are Tory; the
<lb/>“ Edinburgh Review” Whig ; and the “ Westminster” Radical. The “For-
<lb break="no"/>eign Quarterly” is purely literary, being devoted principally to criticisms on
<lb/>foreign Continental Works.</p><p></p><p>The prices of the Re-Prints are less than one third of those of the foreign
<lb/>copies ; and while they are equally well got up, they afford all that advan-
<lb break="no"/>tage to the American over the English reader.</p><p>TERMS.—Payment to be made in Advance.
