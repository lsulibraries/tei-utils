To “The Lady Geraldine”
Though friends had warned me all the while,
And blamed my willing blindness,
I did not once mistrust your smile,
Or doubt your tones of kindness.
I sought you not—you came to me—
With words of friendly greeting:
Alas! how different now I see
That ill-starred moment’s meeting.
When others lightly named your name,
My cordial praise I yielded;
While you would wound with woe and shame,
The soul you should have shielded.
Was it so blest—my life’s estate—
That you with envy viewed me?
Ah, false one! could you dream my fate,
You had not thus pursued me.
Perhaps when those who loved me once,
Beguiled by you, have left me,
You’ll grieve for all the hopes of which,
Your whispered words bereft me.
You’ll think, perhaps, the laugh you raised,
Was hardly worth the anguish,
With which it caused a deep, true heart,
In silent pride to languish.
You’ll think, perchance, the idle jest—
The joy—will scarce reward you,
For all the blame another’s breast
Must now, in scorn, accord you.
Yet go! ’tis but a darker cloud,
O’er one fore-doomed to sadness;
I would not change my grief so proud,
For all your guilty gladness.
Frances S. Osgood.
The Facts in the case of M. Valdemar
</p><p>An article of ours, thus entitled, was published in the last num-ber of Mr. Colton’s “American Review,” and has given rise to
<lb/>some discussion—especially in regard to the truth or falsity of
<lb/>the statements made. It does not become us, of course, to offer 
<lb/>one word on the point at issue. We have been requested to re-
<lb break="no"/>print the article, and do so with pleasure. We leave it to speak
<lb/>for itself. We may observe, however, that there are a certain
<lb/>class of people who pride themselves upon Doubt, as a profes-
<lb break="no"/>sion.—Ed. B. J.</p><p>Of course I shall not pretend to consider it any matter for won-
der, that the extraordinary case of M. Valdemar has excited dis- 
</p><p>cussion. It would have been a miracle had it no!—especially
<lb/>under the circumstances. Through the desire of all parties con-
<lb break="no"/>cerned, to keep the affair from the public, at least for the present,
<lb/>or until we had farther opportunities for investigation—through
<lb/>our endeavors to effect this—a garbled or exaggerated account
<lb/>made its way into society, and became the source of many un-
<lb break="no"/>pleasant misrepresentations, and, very naturally, of a great deal
<lb/>of disbelief.</p><p>It is now rendered necessary that I give the facts—as far as I
comprehend them myself. They are, succinctly, these:
</p><p>My attention, for the last three years, had been repeatedly
<lb/>drawn to the subject of Mesmerism; and, about nine months ago,
<lb/>it occurred to me, quite suddenly, that in the series of experiments
<lb/>made hitherto, there had been a very remarkable and most unac-
<lb break="no"/>countable omission:—no person had as yet been mesmerized in
<lb/>articuio mortis. It remained to be seen, first, whether, in such
<lb/>condition, there existed in the patient any susceptibility to the
<lb/>magnetic influence; secondly, whether, if any existed, it was
<lb/>impaired or increased by the condition; thirdly, to what extent,
<lb/>or for how long a period, the encroachments of Death might be
<lb/>arrested by the process. There were other points to be ascer-
<lb break="no"/>tained, but these most excited my curiosity—the last in especial,
<lb/>from the immensely important character of its consequences.</p><p></p><p>In looking around me for some subject by whose means I might
<lb/>test these particulars, I was brought to think of my friend, M.
<lb/>Ernest Valdemar, the well-known compiler of the “Bibliotheca
<lb/>Forensica,” and author (under the nom de plume of Issachar Marx)
<lb/>of the Polish versions of “Wallenstein” and “Gargantua.” M.
<lb/>Valdemar, who has resided principally at Harlaem, N. Y., since
<lb/>the year 1839, is (or was) particularly noticeable for the extreme
<lb/>spareness of his person—his lower limbs much resembling those
<lb/>of John Randolph; and, also, for the whiteness of his whiskers,
<lb/>in violent contrast to the blackness of his hair—the latter, in con-
<lb break="no"/>sequence, being very generally mistaken for a wig. His temper-
<lb break="no"/>ament was markedly nervous, and rendered him a good subject
<lb/>for mesmeric experiment. On two or three occasions I had put
<lb/>him to sleep with little difficulty, but was disappointed in other
<lb/>results which his peculiar constitution had naturally led me to
<lb/>anticipate. His will was at no period positively, or thoroughly,
<lb/>under my control, and in regard to clairvoyance, I could accom-
<lb break="no"/>plish with him nothing to be relied upon. I always attributed
<lb/>my failure at these points to the disordered state of his health.
<lb/>For some months previous to my becoming acquainted with him,
<lb/>his physicians had declared him in a confirmed phthisis. It was
<lb/>his custom, indeed, to speak calmly of his approaching dissolu-
<lb break="no"/>tion, as of a matter neither to be avoided nor regretted.</p><p>When the ideas to which I have alluded first occurred to me,
it was of course very natural that I should think of M. Valdemar.
</p><p>I knew the steady philosophy of the man too well to apprehend
<lb/>any scruples from him; and he had no relatives in America who
<lb/>would be likely to interfere. I spoke to him frankly upon the
<lb/>subject; and, to my surprise, his interest seemed vividly excited.
<lb/>I say to my surprise; for, although he had always yielded his
<lb/>person freely to my experiments, he had never before given me
<lb/> any tokens of sympathy with what I did. His disease was of</p><p><pb n="366"/>
</p><p>that character which would admit of exact calculation in respect to 
<lb/>the epoch of its termination in death; and it was finally arranged
<lb/>between us that he would send for me about twenty-four hours
<lb/>before the period announced by his physicians as that of his de-
<lb break="no"/>cease.</p><p>It is now rather more than seven months since I received, from 
M. Valdemar himself, the subjoined note:
Mr dear P―,
You may as well come now. D―and F―are agreed,
that I cannot hold out beyond to-morrow midnight; and I think
they have hit the time very nearly.
Valdemar.
</p><p>I received this note within half an hour after it was written,
<lb/>and in fifteen minutes more I was in the dying man’s chamber. 
<lb/>I had not seen him for ten days, and was appalled by the fearful
<lb/>alteration which the brief interval had wrought in him. His face
<lb/>wore a leaden hue; the eyes were utterly lustreless; and the
<lb/>emaciation was so extreme that the skin had been broken through
<lb/>by the cheek-bones. His expectoration was excessive. The
<lb/>pulse was barely perceptible. He retained, nevertheless, in a
<lb/>very remarkable manner, both his mental power and a certain:
<lb/>degree of physical strength. He spoke with distinctness—took
<lb/>some palliative medicines without aid—and, when I entered the
<lb/>room, was occupied in penciling memoranda in a pocket-book.</p><p>He was propped up in the bed by pillows. Doctors D―and
F―were in attendance.
</p><p>After pressing Valdemar’s hand, I took these gentlemen aside,
<lb/>and obtained from them a minute account of the patient’s condi-
<lb break="no"/>tion. The left lung had been for eighteen months in a semi-os-
<lb break="no"/>seous or cartilaginous state, and was, of course, entirely useless
<lb/>for all purposes of vitality. The right, in its upper portion, was
<lb/>also partially, if not thoroughly, ossified, while the lower region
<lb/>was merely a mass of purulent tubercles, running one into an-
<lb break="no"/>other. Several extensive perforations existed; and, at one point,
<lb/>permanent adhesion to the ribs had taken place. These appear-
<lb break="no"/>ances in the right lobe were of comparatively recent date. The
<lb/>ossification had proceeded with very unusual rapidity; no sign
<lb/>of it had been discovered a month before, and the adhesion had
<lb/>only been observed during the three previous days. Independ-
<lb break="no"/>ently of the phthisis, the patient was suspected of aneurism of
<lb/>the aorta; but on this point the osseous symptoms rendered an
<lb/>exact diagnosis impossible. It was the opinion of both physi-
<lb break="no"/>cians that M. Valdemar would die about midnight on the morrow
<lb/>(Sunday). It was then seven o’clock on Saturday evening.</p><p>On quitting the invalid's bed-side to hold conversation with
myself, Doctors D――and F――had bidden him a final farewell, 
It had not been their intention to return; but, at my request, they 
agreed to look in upon the patient about ten the next night.
</p><p>When they had gone, I spoke freely with M. Valdemar on the 
<lb/>subject of his approaching dissolution, as well as, more particu-
<lb break="no"/>larly, of the experiment proposed. He still professed himself
<lb/>quite willing and even anxious to have it made, and urged me
<lb/>to commence it at once. A male and a female nurse were in at-
<lb break="no"/>tendance; but I did not feel myself altogether at liberty to engage
<lb/>in a task of this character with no more reliable witnesses than
<lb/>these people, in case of sudden accident, might prove. I there-
<lb break="no"/>fore postponed operations until about eight the next night, when
<lb/>the arrival of a medical student with whom I had some acquaint-
<lb break="no"/>ance, (Mr. Theodore L——l,) relieved me from farther embar-</p><p></p><p>rassment. It had been my design, originally, to wait for the
<lb/>physicians; but I was induced to proceed, first, by the urgent
<lb/>entreaties of M. Valdemar, and secondly, by my conviction that
<lb/>I had not a moment to lose, as he was evidently sinking fast.</p><p>Mr. L――l was so kind as to accede to my desire that he
</p><p>would take notes of all that occurred; and it is from his memo-
<lb break="no"/>randa that what I now have to relate is, for the most part, either
<lb/>condensed or copied verbatim.</p><p>It wanted about five minutes of eight when, taking the patient’s
hand, I begged him to state, as distinctly as he could, to Mr.
L—, whether he (M. Valdemar) was entirely willing that I
should make the experiment of mesmerizing him in his then con-
dition.
</p><p>He replied feebly, yet quite audibly, “Yes, I wish to be mes-
<lb break="no"/>merized”—adding immediately afterwards, “I fear you have
<lb/>deferred it too long.”</p><p></p><p>While he spoke thus, I commenced the passes which I had
<lb/>already found most effectual in subduing him. He was evidently
<lb/>influenced with the first lateral stroke of my hand across his
<lb/>forehead; but although I exerted all my powers, no farther per-
<lb break="no"/>ceptible effect was induced until some minutes after ten o’clock,
<lb/>when Doctors D――and F――called, according to appointment.</p><p></p><p>I	explained to them, in a few words, what I designed, and as
<lb/>they opposed no objection, saying that the patient was already
<lb/>in the death agony, I proceeded without hesitation—exchanging,
<lb/>however, the lateral passes for downward ones, and directing my
<lb/>gaze entirely into the right eye of the sufferer.</p><p>By this time his pulse was imperceptible and his breathing was
stertorous, and at intervals of half a minute.
</p><p>This condition was nearly unaltered for a quarter of an hour.
<lb/>At the expiration of this period, however, a natural although a
<lb/>very deep sigh escaped the bosom of the dying man, and the
<lb/>stertorous breathing ceased—that is to say, its stertorousness was
<lb/>no longer apparent; the intervals were undiminished. The pa-
<lb break="no"/>tient’s extremities were of an icy coldness.</p><p></p><p>At five minutes before eleven I perceived unequivocal signs of
<lb/>the mesmeric influence. The glassy roll of the eye was changed
<lb/>for that expression of uneasy inward examination which is never
<lb/>seen except in cases of sleep-waking, and which it is quite im-
<lb break="no"/>possible to mistake. With a few rapid lateral passes I made
<lb/>the lids quiver, as in incipient sleep, and with a few more I closed
<lb/>them altogether. I was not satisfied, however, with this, but
<lb/>continued the manipulations vigorously, and with the fullest ex-
<lb break="no"/>ertion of the will, until I had completely stiffened the limbs of
<lb/>the slumberer, after placing them in a seemingly easy position.
<lb/>The legs were at full length; the arms were nearly so, and repo-
<lb break="no"/>sed on the bed at a moderate distance from the loins. The head
<lb/>was very slightly elevated.</p><p></p><p>When I had accomplished this, it was fully midnight, and I
<lb/>requested the gentlemen present to examine M. Valdemar’s con-
<lb break="no"/>dition. After a few experiments, they admitted him to be in an</p><p>unusally perfect state of mesmeric trance. The curiosity of both
the physicians was greatly excited. Dr. D———resolved at once
to remain with the patient all night, while Dr. F———.took leave
with a promise to return at day-break. Mr. L————I and the
nurses remained.
We left M. Valdemar entirely undisturbed until about three
o’clock in the morning, when I approached him and found him
in precisely the same condition as when Dr. F―――went away—
</p><p>that is to say, he lay in the same position; the pulse was im-
<lb break="no"/>perceptible; the breathing was gentle (scarcely noticeable, unless
<lb/>through the application of a mirror to the lips); the eyes were
<lb/>closed naturally; and the limbs were as rigid and as cold as mar-
<lb break="no"/>ble. Still, the general appearance was certainly not that of
<lb/>death.</p><p></p><p>As I approached M. Valdemar I made a kind of half effort to
<lb/>influence his right arm into pursuit of my own, as I passed the
<lb/>latter gently to and fro above his person, In such experiments
<lb/>with this patient I had never perfectly succeeded before, and as-</p><p><pb n="367" break="no" />
</p><p>suredly I had little thought of succeeding now; but to my aston-
<lb break="no"/>ishment, his arm very readily, although feebly, followed every
<lb/>direction I assigned it with mine. I determined to hazard a few
<lb/>words of conversation.</p><p></p><p>“M. Valdemar,” I said, “are you asleep?” He made no an-
<lb break="no"/>swer, but I perceived a tremor about the lips, and was thus
<lb/>induced to repeat the question, again and again. At its third
<lb/>repetition, his whole frame was agitated by a very slight shiver-
<lb break="no"/>ing; the eye-lids unclosed themselves so far as to display a white
<lb/>line of the ball; the lips moved sluggishly, and from between
<lb/>them, in a barely audible whisper, issued the words:</p><p>“Yes;—asleep now. Do not wake me!—let me die so!”
</p><p>I here felt the limbs and found them as rigid as ever. The
<lb/>right arm, as before, obeyed the direction of my hand. I ques-
<lb break="no"/>tioned the sleep-waker again:</p><p>“Do you still feel pain in the breast, M. Valdemar?”
The answer now was immediate, but even less audible than
before:
“No pain—I am dying.”
I did not think it advisable to disturb him farther just then,
and nothing more was said or done until the arrival of Dr. F——,
</p><p>who came a little before sunrise, and expressed unbounded as-
<lb break="no"/>tonishment at finding the patient still alive. After feeling the
<lb/>pulse and applying a mirror to the lips, he requested me to
<lb/>speak to the sleep-waker again. I did so,saying:</p><p>“M. Valdemar, do you still sleep?”
</p><p>As before, some minutes elapsed ere a reply was made; and
<lb/>during the interval the dying man seemed to be collecting his en-
<lb break="no"/>ergies to speak. At my fourth repetition of the question, he said
<lb/>very faintly, almost inaudibly:</p><p>“Yes; still asleep—dying.”
</p><p>It was now the opinion, or rather the wish, of the physicians,
<lb/>that M. Valdemar should be suffered to remain undisturbed in his
<lb/>present apparently tranquil condition, until death should super-
<lb break="no"/>vene—and this, it was generally agreed, must now take place
<lb/>within a few minutes. I concluded, however, to speak to him
<lb/>once more, and merely repeated my previous question.</p><p></p><p>While I spoke, there came a marked change over the countenance
<lb/>of the sleep-waker. The eyes rolled themselves slowly open,
<lb/>the pupils disappearing upwardly; the skin generally assumed
<lb/>a cadaverous hue, resembling not so much parchment as white
<lb/>paper; and the circular hectic spots which, hitherto, had been
<lb/>strongly defined in the centre of each cheek, went out at once.
<lb/>I use this expression, because the suddenness of their departure
<lb/>put me in mind of nothing so much as the extinguishment of a
<lb/>candle by a puff of the breath. The upper lip, at the same time,
<lb/>writhed itself away from the teeth, which it had previously cov-
<lb break="no"/>ered completely; while the lower jaw fell with an audible jerk,
<lb/>leaving the mouth widely extended, and disclosing in full view
<lb/>the swollen and blackened tongue. I presume that no member
<lb/>of the party then present had been unaccustomed to death-bed
<lb/>horrors; but so hideous beyond conception was the appearance of
<lb/>M. Valdemar at this moment, that there was a general shrinking
<lb/>back from the region of the bed.</p><p></p><p>I now feel that I have reached a point of this narrative at which
<lb/>every reader will be startled into positive disbelief. It is my bu-
<lb break="no"/>siness, however, simply to proceed.</p><p></p><p>There was no longer the faintest sign of vitality in M. Val-
<lb break="no"/>demar; and concluding him to be dead, we were consigning him
<lb/>to the charge of the nurses, when a strong vibratory motion was
<lb/>observable in the tongue. This continued for perhaps a minute.
<lb/>At the expiration of this period, there issued from the distended
<lb/>and motionless jaws a voice—such as it would be madness in me
<lb/>to attempt describing. There are, indeed, two or three epithes-
<lb break="no"/>which might be considered as applicable to it in part; I might</p><p></p><p>say, for example, that the sound was harsh, and broken and hol-
<lb break="no"/>low; but the hideous whole is indescribable, for the simple
<lb/>reason that no similar sounds have ever jarred upon the ear of
<lb/>humanity. There were two particulars, nevertheless, which I
<lb/>thought then, and still think, might fairly be stated as character-
<lb break="no"/>istic of the intonation—as well adapted to convey some idea of
<lb/>its unearthly peculiarity. In the first place, the voice seemed to
<lb/>reach our ears—at least mine—from a vast distance, or from
<lb/>some deep cavern within the earth, In the second place, it im-
<lb break="no"/>pressed me (I fear, indeed, that it will be impossible to make
<lb/>myself comprehended) as gelatinous or glutinous matters impress
<lb/>the sense of touch.</p><p></p><p>I have spoken both of “sound” and of “voice.” I mean to
<lb/>say that the sound was one of distinct—of even wonderfully,
<lb/>thrillingly distinct—syllabification. M. Valdemar spoke—obvious-
<lb break="no"/>ly in reply to the question I had propounded to him a few minutes
<lb/>before. I had asked him, it will be remembered, if he still slept-
<lb break="no"/>He now said:</p><p>“Yes;—no;—I have been sleeping—and now—now—I am
dead.’’
No person present even affected to deny, or attempted to repress,
the unuterable, shuddering horror which these few words, thus
uttered, were so well calculated to convey. Mr. L———I (the
</p><p>student) swooned. The nurses immediately left the chamber,
<lb/>and could not be induced to return. My own impressions I
<lb/>would not pretend to render intelligible to the reader. For near-
<lb break="no"/>ly an hour, we busied ourselves, silently—without the utterance</p><p>of a word—in endeavors to revive Mr, L———I. When he came
to himself, we addressed ourselves again to an investigation of
M. Valdemar’s condition.
</p><p>It remained in all respects as I have last described it, with the
<lb/>exception that the mirror no longer afforded evidence of respira-
<lb break="no"/>tion. An attempt to draw blood from the arm failed. I should
<lb/>mention, too, that this limb was no farther subject to my will
<lb/>I endeavored in vain to make it follow the direction of my hand.
<lb/>The only real indication, indeed, of the mesmeric influence, was
<lb/>now found in the vibratory movement of the tongue, whenever
<lb/>I addressed M. Valdemar a question. He seemed to be making
<lb/>an effort at reply, but had no longer sufficient volition. To que-
<lb break="no"/>ries put to him bed any other person than myself he seemed ut-
<lb break="no"/>terly insensible—althoughendeavored to place each member of the company in mesmeric rapport with him. I believe that I have
<lb/>now related all that is necessary to an understanding of the sleep-
<lb break="no"/>waker’s state at this epoch. Other nurses were procured; and
<lb/>at ten o'clock I left the house in company with the two physi-
<lb break="no"/>cians and Mr. L—I.</p><p></p><p>In the afternoon we all called again to see the patient. His
<lb/>condition remained precisely the same. We had now some
<lb/>discussion as to the propriety and feasibility of awakening him;
<lb/>but we had little difficulty in agreeing that no good purpose would
<lb/>be served by so doing. It was evident that, so far, death (or
<lb/>what is usually termed death) had been arrested by the mesmeric
<lb/>process. It seemed clear to us all that to awaken M. Valdemar
<lb/>would be merely to insure his instant, or at least his speedy dis-
<lb break="no"/>solution.</p><p></p><p>From this period until the close of last week—an interval of
<lb/>nearly seven months—we continued to make daily calls at M.
<lb/>Valdemar’s house, accompanied, now and then, by medical and
<lb/>other friends. All this time the sleep-waker remained exactly
<lb/>as I have last described him. The nurses’ attentions were con-
<lb break="no"/>tinual.</p><p></p><p>It was on Friday last that we finally resolved to make the ex-
<lb break="no"/>periment of awakening, or attempting to awaken him; and it is
<lb/>the (perhaps) unfortunate result of this latter experiment which
<lb/>has given rise to so much discussion in private circles—to so</p><p><pb n="368"/>
much of what I cannot help thinking unwarranted popular
eeling.
</p><p>For the purpose of relieving M. Valdemar from the mesmeric
<lb/>trance, I made use of the customary passes. These, for a time,
<lb/>were unsuccessful. The first indication of revival was afforded
<lb/>by a partial descent of the iris. It was observed, as especially
<lb/>remarkable, that this lowering of the pupil was accompanied by
<lb/>the profuse out-flowing of a yellowish ichor (from beneath the
<lb/>lids) of a pungent and highly offensive odor.</p><p>It now was suggested that! sdould attempt to influence the pa-
tient’s arm, as heretofore. I made the attempt and failed. Dr.
F――then intimated a desire to have me put a question. I did so
as follows:
“M. Valdemar, can you explain to us what are your feelings
or wishes now?”
</p><p>There was an instant return of the hectic circles on the cheeks;
<lb/>the tongue quivered, or rather rolled violently in the mouth (al-
<lb break="no"/>though the jaws and lips remained rigid as before;) and at length
<lb/>the same hideous voice which I have already described, broke
<lb/>forth:</p><p>“For God’s sake!—quick!—quick!—put me to sleep—or,
quick!—waken me!—quick!—I say to you that I am dead
</p><p>I was thoroughly unnerved, and for an instant remained unde-
<lb break="no"/>cided what to do. At first I made an endeavor to re-compose the
<lb/>patient; hut, failing in this through total abeyance of the will,
<lb/>I retraced my steps and as earnestly struggled to awaken him. In
<lb/>this attempt I soon saw that I should be successful—or at least I
<lb/>soon fancied that my success would be complete—and I am sure
<lb/>that all in the room were prepared to see the patient awaken.</p><p>For what really occurred, however, it is quite impossible that
any human being could have been prepared.
</p><p>As I rapidly made the mesmeric pasess, amid ejaculations of
<lb/>“dead! dead!” absolutely bursting from the tongue and not from
<lb/>the lips of the sufferer, his whole frame at once—within the space
<lb/>of a single minute, or even less, shrunk—crumbled—absolutely
<lb/>rotted away beneath my hands. Upon the bed, before that whole
<lb/>company, there lay a nearly liquid mass of loathsome—of detes-
<lb break="no"/>table putrescence.</p><p>The Mountains.
Lowland, your sports are low as is your seat;
The Highland games and minds are high and great.
Taylor, the Water Poet.
I.
The axle of the Lowland wain
Goes groaning from the fields of grain;
The Lowlands suit with craft and gain.
Good Ceres, with her plump brown hands,
And wheaten sheaves that burst their bands,
Is scornful of the mountain lands.
But mountain lands—so bare of corn—
Have that which puts, in turn, to scorn
The careful Goddess and her Horn.
Go mark them when, with tramp and jar
Of furious steeds, and flashing car,
The Thunderer sweeps them from afar.
Go mark them when their beauty lies
Drooping, and veiled with violet dyes,
Beneath the light of breathless skies.
No lands of fat increase may vie
With their brave wealth, for heart and eye,
Of loveliness and majesty.

I stand upon an upland lawn;
The river mists are quite withdrawn—
It is three hours beyond the dawn.
</p><p>Autumn works well! But yesterday
<lb/>The mountain hues were green and gray:
<lb/>The elves have surely passed this way.</p><p>With crimping hands and frosty lip,
That merry elfin fellowship,
Robin, and Puck, and Numbernip,
</p><p>Through the clear night have swiftly plied
<lb/>Their tricksy arts of change, and dyed
<lb/>Of all bright hues the mountain side.</p><p>In an old tale Arabian,
Sharp hammer strokes, not dealt by man,
Startle a slumbering caravan.
</p><p>At dawn the wondering merchants see
<lb/>A city built up gloriously
<lb/>Of jasper, and gold, and porphyry.</p><p></p><p>That night-built city of the sands
<lb/>Showed not, as show our mountain lands
<lb/>Changed in a night by elfin hands.</p><p>We may not find, in all the scene,
An unchanged bough or leaf, I ween,
Save of the constant evergreen.
The Maple, on his slope so cool,
Wears his new motley, like the Fool
Prankt out to lead the games of Yule:
Or rather say, that tree of pride
Stands in his mantle, many-dyed,
Bold monarch of the mountain side.
The Ash! a fiery chief is he,
High in the Highland heraldry—
He wears his proud robes gallantly.
</p><p>Torch-bearers are the grim black Pines;
<lb/>Their torches are the flaming vines
<lb/>Bright on the mountain’s skyward lines.</p><p>The blushing Dogwood, thicketed,
Marks everywhere the torrent’s bed
With winding lines of perfect red.
The Oak, so haughty in his green,
Looks craven in an altered mien,
And whimples in the air so keen.
The Hickories, tough although they be.
The Chestnut, and the Tulip tree,
These too have felt the witchery.
The Tree of Life, and dusky Pine,
The Hemlock, swart and saturnine—
Staunch like a demon by his mine—
These still retain a solemn dress,
But, sombre as they be, no less
Make portion of the loveliness.
III.
Just now, no whisper of the air
Awoke, or wandered anywhere.
In all that scene so wild and fair.
<pb n="369"/>
But hark! upborne by swift degrees,
Come forth the mountain melodies—
The music of the wind-tost trees.
And, startled by these utterings,
The parted leaves, like living things,
Skirl up and flock on shining wings.
And, rising from the rainbow route,
A hawk goes swooping round about—
And hark! a rifle shot and shout.
The rifle of the mountaineer—
I know its tongue so quick and clear—
Is out, to-day, against the deer.
Right hardy are the men, I trow,
Who build upon the mountain’s brow,
And love the gun, and scorn the plough.
Not such soft pleasures pamper these,
As lull the subtil Bengalese,
Or islanders of Indian seas.
A rugged hand to cast their seed—
A rifle for the red deer’s speed—
With these their swarming huts they feed.
Such men are Freedom’s body-guard,
On their high rocks, so cold and hard,
They keep her surest watch and ward.
Of such was William Tell, whose bow
Hurtled its shafts, so long ago,
And quelled the Switzer’s haughty foe.
Of such was Arnold Winkelreid,
Who saved his Fatherland at need,
And won, in death, heroic meed.
That deed will live a thousand years!
Young Arnold, with his Switzer peers,
Stood hemmed and hedged with Austrian spears.
His naked arms he opened wide,
“Make way for Liberty,” he cried,
And clasped the hungry spears—and died.
He made a gap for Liberty—
His comrades filled it desperately,
And Switzerland again was free.
IV.
But mark! on yonder summit clear,
Stands the bold hunter of the deer—
The rifle-bearing mountaineer.
From this far hill we may not now
Mark the free courage of his brow,
Or the clear eyes which well avow
The manly virtues of a heart
Untrained to any baser art,
And bold to dare its lot and part.
But a strong vision may define
His gaunt form’s every giant line,
Motionless in the broad sunshine.
And his long gun we note and know—
That weapon dire of overthrow,
More terrible than Tell’s true bow.
But mark again—his step descends;
And now his stately stature blends
With the vague path whereon he wends.
Bare is the gray peak where he stood—
Again the blue sky seems to brood
Over a lovely solitude.
V.
Our life on earth is full of cares,
And the worn spirit oft despairs
Under the groaning load it bears.
When such dark moods will force their way—
When the soul cowers beneath their sway,
Go forth as I have done to-day.
Boon Nature is a foe severe
To pallid brow and shadowy fear,
And lifts the fallen to valiant cheer.
Heed her good promptings—muse and learn—
And, haply, to thy toils return
With a clear heart and courage stern.

The Modern Poetical Literature of Germany.
</p><p>The genius and character of a people manifest themselves most
<lb/>clearly and to the greatest advantage in the language of poetry.
<lb/>Were I now to give a full history of poetical literature in Germany,
<lb/>it would be necessary to show the development of the national
<lb/>genius through all its periods; but such is not the intention of
<lb/>my present essay; my aim is only to give a few sketches of the
<lb/>character of modern poetical German literature. For this reason
<lb/>I do not now dwell on the ancient “Niebelungenlied,” (the
<lb/>German Iliad) and the “Gudrun,” (the German Odyssey,) or on
<lb/>the “Minnelied” of the Troubadours, or on the poems and
<lb/>dramas of Hans Sachs, the celebrated master-singer and shoemaker
<lb/>of Nȕrrenberg, or on the poems of Gellert, Gleim, von Kleist and
<lb/>many others of more recent date. I begin with Lessing, because
<lb/>from his time we date the most flourishing period of German
<lb/>poetry. His contemporaries and successors, whom he had guided
<lb/>by his criticisms, gave fresh life to poesy and successfully culti-
<lb break="no"/>vated particularly the drama, to which the greatest German poets
<lb/>devoted themselves almost exclusively.</p><p></p><p>Other European literatures had flourished, before modern Ger-
<lb break="no"/>man poetry unfolded its flower. But other nations have also en-
<lb break="no"/>joyed the advantage of having had enlightened predecessors.
<lb/>The Italian, Spanish, English, French and German literature
<lb/>have followed each other in successive order. This phenomenon
<lb/>may be ascribed to the fact, that the splendid periods of a nation’s
<lb/>literature exert a powerful influence on neighboring nations.</p><p></p><p>Modern poetical literature in Germany is characterized by an
<lb/>harmonious union of nature, taste and cultivation, such as we
<lb/>find in the dramas of Gӧthe and Schiller, and also in the best
<lb/>society of that country. Literature and society are, in Germany,
<lb/>intimately connected, because literature and science there enliven
<lb/>everything and fill the whole sphere of action. Germany has no
<lb/>public political life; it has, instead of it, literature and the fine
<lb/>arts. This has produced there that literary aristocracy which
<lb/>acknowledges in its sphere no rank but that of genius and of
<lb/>learning, and in whose existence literature is flourishing and
<lb/>glorious.</p><p>Let us turn to some of the best representatives of modem
German poetry.
</p><p>It is with a mingled fueling of admiration and gratitude, that I
<lb/>first mention Lessing, who united wit and erudition, penetration
<lb/>and taste, criticism and creative imagination, in a degree, which</p><p><pb n="370"/>
</p><p>must fill every reader with astonishment and delight—that man,
<lb/>who by his eminent critical writings, was the first to free his
<lb/>country front the chains of a pedantic imitation of the French, and
<lb/>to point out to it an independent path. In his work, entitled
<lb/>“Dramaturgy,” he unfolded fully the errors of the French
<lb/>theories on dramatic composition, together with the defects of
<lb/>the French dramatic writers, and eulogized the best Spanish and
<lb/>English dramas, particularly those of Shakspeare. Of equal
<lb/>merit is his “Laocoon” on the limits of painting and poesy, in
<lb/>which he attacks the mannerism of poetical painting. He shows
<lb/>in this work that the supreme law of Grecian sculpture was ideal
<lb/>beauty of form; and that poesy not considering, like the plastic
<lb/>arts, material bodies, but temporary emotions and events, ought to
<lb/>regard ideal beauty of action as its supreme law. lie thus places
<lb/>in the fore-ground the Epos and Drama, as bearing the nearest
<lb/>affinity to the plastic arts.</p><p></p><p>In his critical writings he was the best pioneer of his time,
<lb/>or as he called himself, “The overseer in the picture-gallery of
<lb/>German literature.” He furnished, at the same time, excellent
<lb/>models in his dramas, “Miss Sarah Sampson,” Emilia Galotti;”
<lb/>and in his comedy, “Minna von Barnhelm.” All are correct
<lb/>and full of truth and nature, though deficient in warmth of poet-
<lb break="no"/>ical inspiration. His genius produced, near the close of his life,
<lb/>the most beautiful flowers. In his late writings, “The Educa-
<lb break="no"/>tion of Mankind,” and the didactic drama, “Nathan the Wise,” he
<lb/>unfolded a depth and clearness of thought which few of his con-
<lb break="no"/>temporaries lightly valued, but for which he is now universally
<lb/>admired, as well as for the power and moral influence of all his
<lb/>works.</p><p></p><p>Widely different from him in style, and yet similar in patriotic
<lb/>sentiment, was Klopstock, the author of those poems which cast
<lb/>such lustre on the German name, and of that exalted epic, “The
<lb/>Messiah,” glorifying our Savior. The sublimity of thought em-
<lb break="no"/>bodied in this poem, renders it in no way inferior to even the
<lb/>productions of Milton. Klopstock commenced this epic in 1746,
<lb/>while yet a student at Jena and Leipzig, and concluded it in the
<lb/>year 1772, with the twentieth canto. In order to enable him to
<lb/>finish it the King of Denmark gave him a pension for life. The
<lb/>slowness of composition was unfavorable to the poem, as his first
<lb/>cantos, written under the influence of youthful enthusiasm, are
<lb/>the best. His poetical talent is more of a lyric than an epic cha-
<lb break="no"/>racter. The lyric and elegiac parts of the work are, therefore,
<lb/>those which appeal most to the feelings of the reader. His lyric
<lb/>muse, replete with genius and deep feeling, is devoted in his
<lb/>odes and elegies to religious and patriotic subjects.</p><p></p><p>At the close of the last century the court of the Duke of Wei-
<lb break="no"/>mar embraced Wieland, Herder, Schiller and Gӧthe, minds which
<lb/>would have conferred the highest renown on any nation.</p><p></p><p>Among the numerous productions of Wieland, I will only men-
<lb break="no"/>tion those pleasing romances, Oberon, Gandalin, Geron, Schach
<lb/>Lolo. In the Abderites, he exhibits the contrast between chival-
<lb break="no"/>rous romance and the spiritless life of matter-of-fact people. The
<lb/>works of Wieland and Klopstock present the most vivid con-
<lb break="no"/>trast, which is also discoverable in the productions of their
<lb/>imitators. Thus, for instance, Wieland sings of earthly attach-
<lb break="no"/>ments, Klopstock of spiritual love; from the mixture of both arose
<lb/>that languishing sentimentality predominating in Gӧthe’s Wer-
<lb break="no"/>ther. A sort of levity pervades some of Wieland’s productions,
<lb/>but his language is easy, pleasing and graceful. His love for
<lb/>antiquity induced him to translate several congenial classic
<lb/>authors; their merits rest more in an able transformation, than in
<lb/>a correct version of the originals. In this species of writing,
<lb/>Wieland is greatly surpassed by Voss. He translated the letters
<lb/>and satires of Horace, Lucian’s works, the plays of Aristophanes,
<lb/>and the letters of Cicero.</p><p></p><p>Herder, in his writings when young, pursued the course of
<lb/>Lessing in his criticism, but gave freer play to his imagination
<lb/>and thus obtained an animating influence over young authors.
<lb/>He especially exerted a favorable influence on Gothe’s youth,
<lb/>and contributed much in deciding the bent of his genius. It may
<lb/>be remarked here in general, that the beneficial effects on litera-
<lb break="no"/>ture resulting from the warm friendships existing among culti-
<lb break="no"/>vated Germans, is a beautiful feature of German life. In their
<lb/>poetry we constantly meet with friends encouraging and guiding
<lb/>each other, and free from envy enjoying their mutual success.
<lb/>Such an intercourse we may behold between Herder, Klinger,
<lb/>Merck and Gӧthe; between Schiller and young Koerner; in the
<lb/>circle of the poets at Halle, with Gleim in its centre, and Rambler,
<lb/>Kleist, Karsch, &amp;c., &amp;c., as its members, and in the poetic circle
<lb/>of Gӧttingen, the so-called “Hainbund,” of which Boie, the
<lb/>counts Stollberg, Voss, Bürger and Hӧlty were the leading stars.
<lb/>Equally worthy of praise are the many instances of brothers
<lb/>uniting in literary pursuits, as for instance, the renowned brothers,
<lb/>the Batons A. and W. Von Humboldt, the Counts Stollberg, the
<lb/>brothers Grimm, Thibaut, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p><p></p><p>Herder possessed an extensive store of learning in every branch
<lb/>of literature, and his productions partake of this many-sided
<lb/>character. He was equally a critic, a poet, a philosopher and a
<lb/>theologian. His love of nature and primitive national customs,
<lb/>was exhibited in all his productions. This he drew from the
<lb/>constant study of Homer, Ossian and Shakspeare, but chiefly
<lb/>from the Bible. One of his most beautiful poetic effusions is the
<lb/>Cid, that interesting romance from Spanish chivalry, in which
<lb/>every character is portrayed with the greatest precision. His
<lb/>sound sense and genius are equally seen in his didactic odes,
<lb/>legends and parables. In him were combined historical investi-
<lb break="no"/>gation, philosophic combination and poetic conception. Hence
<lb/>his nice discrimination between right and wrong, and his skill in
<lb/>recognizing poetry in whatever language it might appear, as the
<lb/>common language of human nature. Thus he loved Oriental,
<lb/>Greek and Roman poetry; he appreciated Ossian, as well as
<lb/>Shakspeare, the Southron romances as well as the German popu-
<lb break="no"/>lar airs. His “Hebrew poetry,” “Saadis,” “Rosenthal,’’
<lb/>“Greek Epigrams,” “Romances,” “Stimmender Votker in Lie-
<lb break="no"/>dern,” are admirable specimens of his taste and style.</p><p></p><p>But what can I say of Gӧthe and Schiller, those heroes of our
<lb/>literature? It is with hesitation that I bring their merits in
<lb/>remembrance. Schiller and Gӧthe are renowned throughout the
<lb/>world, and their works are too numerous and too multifarious to
<lb/>admit of a separate enumeration and review, as my limits allow
<lb/>but a few general remarks. Gӧthe’s and Schiller’s views of life
<lb/>are almost as valuable as their poetry, and we treat them, both as
<lb/>philosophers and poets, as representatives of poesy as well as
<lb/>of life in general. Gӧthe’s early drama, “Gӧtz von Berlich-
<lb break="no"/>ingen,” true to nature, shows in every scene that the author is
<lb/>complete master of any subject he treats. Iphigehia” and
<lb/>“Tasso,” his later dramas, expressing the poet’s fervent and clear
<lb/>perceptions of antiquity, are fraught with touches of the finest
<lb/>taste and ideal beauty. His “ Faust,” in its first part the greatest
<lb/>effort of poetical diction and philosophical depth of thought, is
<lb/>his master-piece. Gӧthe’s talents were divided between tragedy,
<lb/>comedy, and romance, and the productions of his imitators and
<lb/>successors exhibit an almost equal number of each.</p><p></p><p>Schiller’s greatest productions are his dramas, among which
<lb/>“Don Carlos,” “Maria Stuart,” “Wilhelm Tell,” and “Wallen-
<lb break="no"/>stein,” are the best—the latter is his master-piece, and has been
<lb/>admirably translated by Coleridge. He appears equally great as
<lb/>a poet and a philosopher. By uniting taste and nature he reached
<lb/>the highest perfection in the dramatic art. The form of his dramas
<lb/>places them clearly between those of Shakspeare and Sophocles-</p><p><pb n="371" break="no" />
Modern dramatists cannot, without the greatest danger, renounce
the form given to the drama by Schiller.
</p><p>But a criticism on the numerous productions of these authors
<lb/>is not my object; my aim being rather to depict the character of
<lb/>the two poets in a general view, in which I would compare the
<lb/>works of Schiller with Swiss scenery; those of Göthe with a
<lb/>variegated landscape.</p><p></p><p>Like the majestic Alps, raising their lofty pinnacles above the
<lb/>clouds, are the thoughts of Schiller; and pure as the eternal
<lb/>snow on these Alpine crests, is his morality; calm and lovely as
<lb/>Helvetia’s valleys are his feelings, and clear as the lake which
<lb/>bears the image of the sublime scenery around, and of the azure
<lb/>sky above, is the character of man reflected in Schiller’s mind.</p><p>Schiller’s works are to be found in every German family; he is
the poet of the nation and the idol of youth.
</p><p>Göthe’s works, on the' other hand, represent his versatile genius,
<lb/>and expand themselves before us like a variegated landscape,
<lb/>abounding in meadows, fields and trees, adorned with blossoms,
<lb/>and laden with fruit; which is traversed by a road, enlivened by
<lb/>travelers of all sorts and conditions, both great and small, high
<lb/>and low, good and bad, in silk and finery, and in the working
<lb/>clothes of common life, philosophers and statesmen, warriors and
<lb/>peaceful citizens, gay courtiers and care-worn artizans. Let us
<lb/>imagine this landscape to be bordered by the great ocean; its calm
<lb/>and tranquil surface reminds us, if far from home, of those peace-
<lb break="no"/>ful scenes of domestic life, to which the poet occasionally intro-
<lb break="no"/>duces us; and does not that same ocean, when agitated by the
<lb/>tempest, present a picture of the misery and desolation created
<lb/>by passion and vice in those happy scenes to which we have
<lb/>alluded? The many treasures occasionally thrown up from the
<lb/>bosom of the ocean may afford us some idea of the value of those
<lb/>concealed beneath its waves, and thus it is with Göthe, who has
<lb/>displayed to us many of the pearls and gems drawn from the deep
<lb/>recesses of his mind.</p><p></p><p>With the dawn of German emancipation from the French yoke,
<lb/>Schiller’s poetry ignited, penetrated and matured every plan of
<lb/>action. At that time Göthe was fading in the estimation of the
<lb/>young, and Schiller’s spirit presided over the lyric of the day.
<lb/>His social and war-songs, as well as his ballads, have by the aid
<lb/>of composers become popular airs. Theodore Körner, the son of
<lb/>Schiller’s most faithful friend, the renowned martyr and leader of
<lb/>those songsters, joining the lyre with the sword, produced poems
<lb/>and dramas closely approaching those of Schiller, and breathing
<lb/>the spirit of those animated times. Though Körner’s life was
<lb/>short, he will forever live as the youthful poet in the grateful
<lb/>love of his country.</p><p></p><p>Jean Paid Richter, although contemporary of the before-named
<lb/>poets, stands alone in his original individuality. All the elements
<lb/>of German life of his time, the depth and sensitiveness of feeling,
<lb/>the severity of satire, the humor, the seriousness, the sparkling
<lb/>of juvenile fancy, the sober views of sound judgment, suscepti-
<lb break="no"/>bility and power of mind, poetry and knowledge, ideality and con-
<lb break="no"/>tentment, are concentrated in that one man as in a focus, and are
<lb/>reflected in his voluminous works. His writings show everywhere
<lb/>his warm feeling for innocence and purity of early youth; they
<lb/>breathe the enthusiasm of his friendship, love and virtue, and con-
<lb break="no"/>tain the most beautiful principles and reflections; and where he
<lb/>shows these feelings in contact with the rough touches of the world,
<lb/>he gives free play to his wit and humor, without bitterness. Jean
<lb/>Paul is in his writings perpetually youthful. As a humorist he
<lb/>stands highest among the German authors. He unites all the
<lb/>elements of the highest culture of mind and feeling as they more
<lb/>peculiarly exist in Germany, and he is its truest representative.
<lb/>The most intimate acquaintance with the social and literary life</p><p></p><p>in Germany is therefore requisite in order to understand him. His
<lb/>style is bold and therefore not very clear; but the originality of
<lb/>his thoughts and feelings excuses his peculiarities of expression.
<lb/>His humorous novels, Hesperus, Titan, Flegeljahre, Katzenber-
<lb break="no"/>ger’s Baclereise, and others, are universally known; and also
<lb/>his scientific and literary works are of the highest value.</p><p></p><p>If we turn from the period in which the genius of a Göthe
<lb/>and a Schiller united to raise the poetical literature of the German
<lb/>people to its culminating point, towards that of their immediate
<lb/>or later successors, we meet with difficulty in forming a just
<lb/>appreciation of the merits of the latter, from our judgment ever
<lb/>measuring their productions by the scale furnished by the effu-
<lb break="no"/>sions of the above-mentioned poets, and never reflecting on the
<lb/>plausibility of much good emanating from less prominent talents.
<lb/>Indeed, whatever severe critics may say to the contrary, German
<lb/>literature has of late been enriched by productions that are far
<lb/>from lessening the hopes for her future glory. Passing at once
<lb/>from the period of Göthe and Schiller, to the writings of the
<lb/>present time, an account of which may be expected from me, we
<lb/>find the vast store of new productions in the field of Belles-let-
<lb break="no"/>tres, so materially increased within the last few years, as to ren-
<lb break="no"/>der their enumeration in conjunction with a short sketch as to
<lb/>their critical value, a task of some difficulty. I shall accordingly
<lb/>omit many eminent names, and only review the most recent works
<lb/>of lyric, epic and dramatic poesy, and arrange them in groups, as
<lb/>far as their nature permits.</p><p></p><p>Lyric poetry, like the vine, seems chiefly suited to the southern
<lb/>scil of Germany, especially to Swabia, the fatherland of Schil-
<lb break="no"/>ler. Uhland’s delightful romances on topics from the ch valrous
<lb/>ages, are generally known and admired ; their innocence, gravity
<lb/>and depth of feeling corresponding perfectly with the German
<lb/>character. Contemporaneous and distinguished in the same spe-
<lb break="no"/>cies of poetry, are G. Schwab and Kerner, the latter replete with
<lb/>gloomy thoughts and forebodings of death, Wilhelm Muller, the
<lb/>writer of sweet and merry songs, Adolphus Tellkampf, whose
<lb/>poems, though scattered through a great variety of periodical
<lb/>and fugitive publications, are valued for depth and originality
<lb/>—more it does not become me to say of a brother. Von Eichen-
<lb break="no"/>dorff, with an inexhaustible love for the verdant forest, (a true
<lb/>German trait,) and Adelbert Von Chamisso, a Frenchman set-
<lb break="no"/>tled in Germany, distinguished for vigorous language and a fresh
<lb/>and independent spirit. Mrs. Robinson, wife of the professor in
<lb/>New York, also is distinguished for her elegant productions,
<lb/>among which are here to be noticed her beautiful poems, entitled
<lb/>“ Serbische Lieder,” published in Germany under the assumed
<lb/>name of Talvj.</p><p></p><p>One of the most distinguished modern poets among those who
<lb/>did not confine themselves to German subjects, are Riickert, the
<lb/>bard of the East, vieing with Hafiz in writing the most beautiful
<lb/>German verses after the Persian and Arabian manner. A master
<lb/>of that species of poetry, he has but one competitor, Count Platen,
<lb/>who strove with equal skill to imitate the Greek and Roman poets,
<lb/>but too early found a grave on the classic soil of Sicily. His
<lb/>poems are as smooth as the polished marble, and as graceful as
<lb/>the ancient statue. In strong contrast with Platen is Freiligrath,
<lb/>the poetic painter of the sea and desert, who amid the rich lustre
<lb/>of his coloring, and southern warmth of scenery, never ventures
<lb/>to portray the wonders of antiquity.</p><p></p><p>The latest style of Lyric poetry in Germany is opposed to this
<lb/>spirit, since it attaches itself exclusively to the German soil, and
<lb/>desires to express popular ideas. It might be called the political
<lb/>lyric, and has the disadvantage of treating on a subject which
<lb/>cannot be deemed poetical, namely, politics ! Thus this species
<lb/>of lyric often sacrifices entirely the character of poesy. The</p><p><pb n="372"/>
</p><p>first strains of this sort came from Heinrich Heine and from
<lb/>an Austrian, Count Auersperg, who, under the name of Anasta-
<lb break="no"/>sius Grün, published humorous scenes overflowing with rage
<lb/>against worldly and spiritual tyranny. He soon found an asso-
<lb break="no"/>ciate in Von Stre'itenan, (Nicolaus Lenau,) also an Austrian-
<lb break="no"/>His poems were succeeded by those of Hoffman Von Fallersleben,
<lb/>Dingelstedt and Prutz, ail of a similar tendency, written partly
<lb/>in a satirical and partly in a grave tone; Georg Herwegh and
<lb/>Harro Harring, with a revolutionary spirit, followed in their
<lb/>wake.</p><p></p><p>When we consider the numerous effusions of lyric poetry in
<lb/>Germany, the scarcity of epic productions appears surprising; in
<lb/>the Epos, only Ladislaus Pyker, and in the Idyl, only Eberhard,
<lb/>are worthy of notice, though their poems are of inferior value.
<lb/>Let us not, however, limit the idea of epic poetry to the strict
<lb/>form of verse, hut embrace in it every characteristic exhibition of
<lb/>epic matter, thus extending it to romance and novel. The latter
<lb/>presents a field for a rich harvest—so rich indeed, as to render their
<lb/>critical examination within our present limits a difficult task.
<lb/>Yet I will attempt it, taking the liberty of distinguishing the chief
<lb/>tendencies of German novels in the early part of this century, as
<lb/>the classic, romantic, and imaginative-humorous. Gӧthe, formed
<lb/>after the models of antiquity, marks the first, by making us, in
<lb/>the absorbing interest of his matter, lose sight of the author.
<lb/>The second emanated from Tieck, and the third from Jean Paul
<lb/>Richter. The manner of these three writers may be clearly traced
<lb/>in the later progress of literature, although we cannot deny that
<lb/>there is more or less coincidence in several of their productions.
<lb/>Gӧthe’s social novels, “Wilhelm Meister,” and the “Wahlver-
<lb break="no"/>wandschaften,” in which he exhibits, with psychological depth,
<lb/>the state of society, chiefly in the higher circles,—are succeeded
<lb/>by Immermann's “Epigonen,” and partly by his more original
<lb/>Munchhausen; the same style is followed by Von Sternberg, in a
<lb/>series of novels and romances, wherein he depicts, with simpli-
<lb break="no"/>city, elegance, and sublimity, portraits and conflicts of European
<lb/>aristocratic society. Of the same nature are the novels of the
<lb/>Countess Hahn-Hahn, who delights in sketches of artless nature,
<lb/>as well as of high life, reflected in her high and unrestrained
<lb/>genius. Laube is less successful in his wanderings through the
<lb/>higher circles, since he depicts imaginary characters. Yet we
<lb/>must allow him the merit of being an agreeable describer of
<lb/>passing events. With deeper feeling, Dingelstedt, and with bril-
<lb break="no"/>liant wit, Detmold, in Hanover, pursue the same line, in tragic and
<lb/>humorous pictures of the conflicts of life.</p><p></p><p>The poetry of the romantic school moves in an entirely differ-
<lb break="no"/>ent orbit. I have named Tieck as the leader of this school, though
<lb/>he too, in a series of novels, joined the above-mentioned species
<lb/>of writing. In a similar manner as Sir Walter Scott, who, in trans-
<lb break="no"/>lating the Elenora of Bürger first found that he himself was a
<lb/>poet, thus roused by the poetic spirit of Sir Walter Scott’s his-
<lb break="no"/>torical novels, Tieck composed his “Revolt in the Cevennes," an
<lb/>exquisite, though as yet incomplete work. This historical paint-
<lb break="no"/>ing is a fine specimen of the art, evincing both romantic poesy
<lb/>and psychological depth. He depicts public life with a continual
<lb/>reference to domestic circumstances; at one time presenting them
<lb/>at variance, and at another in harmony. His historical novels,
<lb/>“The Poet’s Life," and “The Poet’s Death,” are replete with
<lb/>beauties. The King of Prussia has given him a situation in
<lb/>Berlin, where he can at his leisure devote himself to his muse.
<lb/>He has had a series of able imitators. As favorite novelists of
<lb/>this school, I must mention Spindler and Blumenhagen, both
<lb/>gifted with imagination, but often overstepping the bounds of
<lb/>beauty, and sinking into caricature. Heinrich Zschokke is of
<lb/>surpassing value as a novelist, and theological and historical</p><p></p><p>writer. The clearness and simplicity of his diction, and the
<lb/>noble sentiments expressed, render him one of the most popular
<lb/>writers.</p><p></p><p>A truly poetic spirit is evinced by H. Steffens, in his “Norwe-
<lb break="no"/>gians,” by Win. Alexis (Häring), in his “Cabanis,” “Roland of
<lb/>Berlin,” and “Pseudo Waldemar,” subjects taken from the Prus-
<lb break="no"/>sian history, and treated with much truth and nature. Heinrich
<lb/>Kӧnig also belongs to this class; in his "Waldenses,” his re-
<lb break="no"/>nowned "Bride,” and his “Willis Dichten und Trachten,” he
<lb/>makes Europe, the south in the two former and the north in the
<lb/>latter, the scene of highly poetic events. The much-read “God-
<lb break="no"/>win Castle,” “St. Roche,” &amp;c., &amp;c., are the late productions of
<lb/>Madame von Paalzou, a highly-gifted lady, who traversed Eng-
<lb break="no"/>land, France and Germany, in search of subjects for historical
<lb/>novels. With greater fidelity to history Theodor Mügge depicts
<lb/>the conflicts in the Vendee, and at Hayti, (in his "Vendeerin”
<lb/>and “Toussaint,”) and Theodor Mundt the war of the German
<lb/>peasants in his “ Thomas Münzer.” The former is distinguished
<lb/>by rare talents and vivid coloring, the latter, by wise reflections.
<lb/>In considering fantastic novels, in which wit is joined with hu-
<lb break="no"/>mor, I would place on the foreground those of Leopold Schäfer,
<lb/>similar to Jean Paul’s original productions. The former bears
<lb/>the reader far from the German soil and the narrow sphere of do-
<lb break="no"/>mestic life in which Jean Paul delights to linger.</p><p></p><p>Gutykow's “Blasedon," as a comic novel, is an imitation of
<lb/>Jean Paul’s comic vein. Immermann’s “Münchhaussen,” too,
<lb/>comes partly under this head. For unvarnished descriptions of
<lb/>humble life and nature, perhaps, also, Eichendorffs charming
<lb/>novels should be mentioned here, though they, like Fouqué's
<lb/>“Undine,” contain more the purely romantic element of legends,
<lb/>a species of poetry once presenting so brilliant an appearance in
<lb/>Tieck’s “Phantasus,” but since led astray by Hoffmann’s strange
<lb/>creations, and at present but little cultivated.</p><p></p><p>Proceeding, finally, from the epic poetry to the comedy, we
<lb/>are forcibly struck by the gloomy perception of the art retrograd-
<lb break="no"/>ing from the elevation it had attained by the exertions of Lessing
<lb/>and Göthe; and, in the present situation of German public life,
<lb/>there is small ground to hope for its improvement. Comedy, to
<lb/>flourish, must not be confined only to the representation of com-
<lb break="no"/>mon life, but have a certain freedom to treat of public persons
<lb/>and events. The Princess Amalia of Saxony has made success-
<lb break="no"/>ful attempts in representing humble life in her popular comedies.
<lb/>Among the other writers of comedy none are worthy of notice,
<lb/>save Bauemfeld at Vienna, and Raupach at Berlin, though I
<lb/>know neither an Aristophanic satirical, nor a psychologically ex-
<lb break="no"/>cellent comedy of their composition, nor even one which much
<lb/>surpasses the comedies of Kotzebue.</p><p></p><p>Tragedy has been cultivated with greater success and copious
<lb/>ness. Michael Beer, (as did once Theodor Kӧrner,) struggles to
<lb/>become a successful follower of Schiller; while Grabbe, and the
<lb/>talented Immermann, are both in their manner and choice of his-
<lb break="no"/>torical subjects, original writers. Under the influences of recent
<lb/>times have been furnished several successful dramas, which have
<lb/>been much applauded, as Gutykow’s “Richard Savage,” Julius
<lb/>Mooen’s “Otto III.,” and Prutz’s “ Charles of Bourbon.”</p><p></p><p>The lyric-idylic taste of the nation has prepared the way for
<lb/>a favorable reception of a few dramas, written with this tendency
<lb/>by Friedrich Halm (von Bellinghausen). They make us, how-
<lb break="no"/>ever, feel but too deeply the insufficiency of an elegant style,
<lb/>and the invention of some charming scenes, to supply the want
<lb/>of a higher characteristic and of more eventful action.</p><p></p><p>What I deem of more importance than an allusion to so many
<lb/>eminent names, is the observation that German literature, and
<lb/>especially poetry, must not be viewed as standing isolated and</p><p><pb n="373"/>
independent, since the same national genius manifests itself in
various fine arts, especially in music.
</p><p>Gӧthe and Mozart resemble each other in reflecting the images
<lb/>and sentiments presented by the occurrences of life clearly as a
<lb/>mirror, but embellished and perfectly harmonized. Schiller and
<lb/>Karl Maria Von Weber combine the highly ideal, with an ar-
<lb break="no"/>dent desire for the attainment of perfection. The compositions
<lb/>of Beethoven and of Jean Paul Richter are similar to each other,
<lb/>in both exhibiting a lively and playful imagination, united with
<lb/>a romantic depth of feeling. All have strewn imperishable songs
<lb/>and melodies over the path of life. Their songs resound in the
<lb/>cottage and the palace, filling the tranquil heart with delight, and
<lb/>weeping eyes with the brightness of cheerfulness and peace.</p><p>T. L. Tellkampf.
Critical Notices.
Biographical and Critical Notices. By William H. Prescott,
Author of “The History of Ferdinand and Isabella,” “The
Conquest of Mexico," etc. New York: Harper &amp; Brothers.
</p><p>An octavo of 638 pages—uniform with the previous works of
<lb/>Prescott issued by the same house. In all respects this beautiful
<lb/>volume is a valuable addition to our literature.</p><p></p><p>The essays included are purely of a literary character, with
<lb/>little reference to local and temporary topics, and with a single
<lb/>exception are from “The North American Review”—styled by the
<lb/>author, in the Preface to the British edition, “the most consider-
<lb break="no"/>able journal in the United States.” We fear that its considera-
<lb break="no"/>tion, at present, is confined chiefly to the precincts of Faneuil
<lb/>Hall.</p><p></p><p>Of the essays themselves it is quite superfluous to speak.
<lb/>They have been justly and universally admired, and in our own
<lb/>view are, generally, the best American papers of their kind.
<lb/>Their titles are, Charles Brockden Brown—Asylum for the Blind
<lb/>—Irving’s Conquest of Granada—Cervantes—Sir Walter Scott—
<lb/>Chateaubriand’s English Literature—Bancroft’s United States—
<lb/>Madame Calderon’s Life in Mexico—Moliére—Italian Narrative
<lb/>Poetry—Poetry and Romance of the Italians—Scottish Song—
<lb/>and Da Ponte’s Observations. The first of these articles is from
<lb/>Sparks’ “American Biography,” and is of unusual interest, con-
<lb break="no"/>veying a just and forcible picture of one of the most singular and
<lb/>powerful of American intellects. The memoir can scarcely be
<lb/>termed critical, but it abounds in passages evincing the keenest
<lb/>discrimination in respect to the literary position of the author
<lb/>reviewed.</p><p></p><p>The papers next in value are, perhaps, those on Sir Walter
<lb/>Scott, and Chateaubriand’s English literature—but, in all, the
<lb/>the taste, judgment, and scholarship of Prescott are rendered
<lb/>manifest. We shall speak again of this volume, next week:</p><p>Trifles in Verse: a Collection of Fugitive Poems. By Lewis J.
Cist. Cincinnati: Robinson &amp; Jones.
</p><p>This is a duodecimo of 184 pages, well printed and bound.
<lb/>We regret to say, also, that it has for frontispiece a very greasy-
<lb break="no"/>looking lithograph portrait of the author—we cannot conceive
<lb/>what could have beguiled Mr. Cist into the perpetration of such
<lb/>absurdity.</p><p>The collection is so modestly prefaced as to disarm criticism.
Mr. C. says:
</p><p>To the high and honored title of Poet, in the legitimate sense of
<lb/>the term, the writer of the following pages makes no pretensions.
<lb/>Engaged, from his earliest youth, upwards, in a daily round of mer-</p><p></p><p>cantile pursuits, the “Trifles” which he thus offers to the public—
<lb/>the offspring of moments stolen from the desk of the banking-house
<lb/>and the counting-room—can, at the best, only entitle him to the
<lb/>more humble name of Versifier. Conscious of his want of those
<lb/>qualifications which might justify him in seeking to enter the inner
<lb/>temple of the sacred Nine, he has but ventured to loiter around the
<lb/>base of the flowery mountain; contenting himself with occasionally
<lb/>gleaning—here, it may be, a weed, and there, perchance, a flower—
<lb/>from such by-nooks and out of the way corners of the field of Fancy,
<lb/>as had been passed over by the more worthy and accredited gather-
<lb break="no"/>ers of the golden-hued harvests of Parnassus.</p><p></p><p>The poems themselves are not particularly imaginative, but
<lb/>evince much purity of taste and fervor of feeling. We copy one
<lb/>of the best:</p><p>OLDEN MEMORIES.
They are jewels of the mind;
They are tendrils of the heart,
That with being are entwined—
Of our very selves a part.
They the records are of youth,
Kept to read in after years;
They are manhood’s well of truth,
Filled with childhood’s early tears.
Like the low and plaintive moan
Of the night-wind through the trees,
Sweet to hear, though sad and lone,
Are those “Olden Memories!”
Like the dim traditions, hoary,
Of our loved and native clime;
Like some half-forgotten story,
Read or heard in olden time;
Like the fresh’ning dew of even
To the parched and drooping flower;
Like the peaceful thought of Heaven,
In life's tempest-stricken hour;
Like the cadence of a song;—
</p><p>Yet, oh! sweeter far than these
<lb/>Are the thoughts that round us throng
<lb/>With those “Olden Memories!”</p><p>In the solitude of even,
When the spirit, lone and dreary,
Turns from Earth away, to Heaven,
As the refuge of the weary;
In the dreamy twilight hour,
When the world is calm and still,
And light zephyrs fragrance shower
Over dewy vale and hill;
Oh! then, sweeter than perfume
Borne on aromatic breeze,
To the softened spirit come
Those dear “Olden Memories!”
In our days of mirth and gladness
We may spurn their faint control,
But they come, in hours of sadness,
Like sweet music to the soul;
And in sorrow, o’er us stealing
With their gentleness and calm,
They are leaves of precious healing,
They are fruits of choicest balm.
Ever till, when life departs,
Death from dross the spirit frees,
Cherish, in thine heart of hearts,
All thine “ Olden Memories!”

</p><p>The Diadem fur 1846. A Present for All Seasons. With Ten
<lb/>Engravings, after Pictures by Inman, Leutze, &amp;c. Philadel-
<lb break="no"/>phia: Carey &amp; Hart.</p><p></p><p>The Diadem is a quarto of very rich appearance in every re-
<lb break="no"/>spect, and especially well adapted for a Christmas Gift. It is
<lb/>edited by the Rev. W. H. Furness of Philadelphia. Its engra-
<lb break="no"/>vings are, for the most part, of high merit. The frontispiece is
<lb/>particularly excellent—a mezzotint in Sartain’s best manner, from
<lb/>Inman’s painting, “The Page.” The face is one of great sweet-
<lb break="no"/>ness and dignity of expression—but there is a pursiness about
<lb/>the chest and shoulders which slightly displeases. The title-
<lb break="no"/>page is from Leutze—an emblematical design—an angel present-
<lb break="no"/>ing various devices. The editor speaks justly of the figure’s
<lb/>“serene and earnest eyes”—but the composition of the whole
<lb/>work is confused. “The Momentous Question” by Sartain is
<lb/>from a well-known painting by Miss Setchal, representing a
<lb/>vivid scene from Crabbe—admirable altogether. “The Fisher-
<lb break="no"/>man’s Daughter” and “The Falconer’s Son” are somewhat rash-
<lb break="no"/>ly taken from Landseer’s picture of Bolton Abbey, the composition
<lb/>of which is so remarkably meritorious. In cutting out portions
<lb/>from such a work, there should have been fresh accessories, etc.
<lb/>What is admirable in its due position in a large picture, is very
<lb/>often displeasing when taken by itself, or merely with the points
<lb/>immediately surrounding it. “The Heart’s Misgivings” by Sar-
<lb break="no"/>tain from Frank Stone, is excellent. “The Early Dawn” also
<lb/>by Sartain from Joshua Cristall is, we think, the best picture in
<lb/>the Annual, with the exception of “The Mask” from Inman:—
<lb/>the mezzotinting in this last, is exceedingly good. “The Home-
<lb break="no"/>less” is from a picture by P. Poole an English artist, and has
<lb/>much force. The only engraving left unmentioned is a portrait
<lb/>of the deceased Edward L. Carey, drawn and engraved by Sartain.
<lb/>As a likeness we do not think it does full justice to the original,
<lb/>but we learn that it was partially taken after death.</p><p></p><p>The literary matter is supplied by the Editor—by Miss Lynch,
<lb/>Emerson and others. In general it is superior to the literature in
<lb/>Annuals. Here is something exceedingly piquant and naive.</p><p>A FABLE.
BY R. W. EMERSON.
The mountain and the squirrel
Had a quarrel,
And the former called the latter “ little prig”;
Bun replied,
“You are doubtless very big,
</p><p>But all sorts of things and weather
<lb/>Must be taken in together
<lb/>To make up a year
<lb/>And a sphere;</p><p>And I think it no disgrace
To occupy my place.
If I’m not so large as you,
You are not so small as I
And not half so spry.
I’ 11 not deny you make
A very pretty squirrel track;
Talents differ; all is well and wisely put;
If I cannot carry forests on my back,
Neither can you crack a nut.

</p><p>A thick duodecimo of 372 pages, fine paper, richly bound, and

<lb break="no"/>men of Baxter’s new process of printing in oil colors—subject</p><p></p><p>the Destruction of the Tanjore by lightning off Ceylon. In its
<lb/>literary contents the volume is especially rich. Among the
<lb/>names of contributors we notice Mrs. Sigourney, Whittier, Low-
<lb break="no"/>ell, Hoyt, Tuckerman, Miss Gould, Simms, Mrs. Mowatt, Man-
<lb break="no"/>cur, Epes Sargent, and others. The papers are, without excep-
<lb break="no"/>tion well written, and principally of a religious cast. The
<lb/>volume is inscribed to “The Friends of Missions.” Too much
<lb/>praise cannot be bestowed upon the editorial conduct and general

<lb/>upon the whole one of the most meritorious gift-books of the

<lb/>are all replete with interest, and there is not one of the ten en-
<lb break="no"/>gravings which is not a bijou. The Frontispiece and Title-page
<lb/>are exquisite, and the finest taste is displayed throughout.</p><p></p><p>The May-flower for 1846. Edited by Robert Hamilton.—
<lb/>Boston: Saxton &amp; Kelt. For sale in New- York by Saxton &amp;
<lb/>Miles and Saxton &amp; Huntingdon.</p><p></p><p>We have twice before noticed “The May-flower” but, while
<lb/>we are on the subject of Annuals, cannot refrain from once again
<lb/>calling attention to its merits.</p><p></p><p>It opens with a very beautiful frontispiece—a mezzotint by
<lb/>Sartain from a painting by Winterhalter. The engravings through-
<lb break="no"/>out are by Sartain, and all are excellent—particularly so—in the
<lb/>way of small mezzotints we have never seen anything better.
<lb/>One of them, “Cup-Tossing,” from Crowley, is truly exquisite.</p><p>The contributions are, in general, from the most noted pens in
America.
</p><p>Elinor Willys; or the Young Folk of Longbridge. A tale. By
<lb/>Amabel Penfeather. Two volumes. Edited by J. Fenimore
<lb/>Cooper. Philadelphia: Carey &amp; Hart.</p><p>Mr. Cooper, in an Editor’s preface, says very seriously:
</p><p>The writer of this book is a valued female friend, who had a right
<lb/>to ask, and did ask, its editor’s advice and assistance in presenting it
<lb/>to the public. That advice and assistance have been cheerfully
<lb/>afforded, though neither has properly extended to the literary char-
<lb break="no"/>acter of the work. As the author has not wished to appear, the
<lb/>name of the editor has been used in obtaining the copy-right, and
<lb/>his assistance given in forwarding and returning proof-sheets. Over
<lb/>a few of the last the editor has cast his eye; but believing the author
<lb/>fully competent herself to superintend her own work, this supervi-
<lb break="no"/>sion on the part of the editor has been very slight.</p><p>The author (real or supposititious) says afterwards in her own
preface:
</p><p>It will be more honest to confess at once, before the reader under-
<lb break="no"/>takes the first chapter, that the tale now before him is a first appear-
<lb break="no"/>ance in print, etc.</p><p>And subsequently:
</p><p>If there are books which must be read, stupid or not, owing to
<lb/>the claim of some great name on the binding, the present story is
<lb/>not one of the number, etc.</p><p></p><p>All which only makes it apparent to our mind that Mr. Cooper
<lb/>is both author and editor. The names, as well as grammar,
<lb/>throughout, are exceedingly Cooperish- -and the dialogue is es-
<lb break="no"/>pecially so. The narrative is one of much interest.</p><p>Wiley &amp; Putnam's Library of Choice Reading, No. 38. The

The book of Christmas is descriptive of the “ Customs, Cere-

<lb/>believe, only an initial one; being limited to a review of the fes-
<lb break="no"/>tival and its observances as they exist in England—adverting to
<lb/>the practices of other countries only incidentally. The book is
<lb/>full of interest, and is very seasonably put forth.</p><p></p><p>First Lessons in English Composition; or, a Help to Young Wri-

<lb/>(by Uncle Davy) may be by Humphrey Davy, or his ghost, for
<lb/>anything that we know to the contrary, but with a fund of accu-
<lb break="no"/>rate chemical information it contains some unusually loose gram-
<lb break="no"/>mar. On the very first page, for example, we read:</p><p>Heat means the substance, that, when enough of it gets into any-
thing, it makes that thing feel hot.

thing written by Thomas Carlyle.

</p><p>The German Opera, at Palmo’s, affords a nightly reunion of
<lb/>the lovers of classical music. Der Freischutz is performed in a
<lb/>style we little expected to find. The choruses are admirable—
<lb/>belter in fact than any we ever had in this city—and any one
<lb/>who knows what is the drudgery and difficulty of rehearsing an
<lb/>opera, with choristers of five or six different nations, one half of
<lb/>them scarcely acquainted with the first rudiments of music, will
<lb/>award great credit to the chorus master, Mr. Albert Berg. The
<lb/>first and second ladies, Madame Otto and Fraulein Korsinsky, the
<lb/>first for her admirable and correct singing, the latter for singing
<lb/>and acting, deserve high praise. Mr. Boucher astonished us by
<lb/>his beautiful enunciation, and when we consider that this gentle-
<lb break="no"/>man has not sung in public before for eight years, he did far better
<lb/>than could be expected. On the whole, we think that, for the
<lb/>first time the American public can hear German music performed
<lb/>in German style. From their continual improvement, the troupe
<lb/>will probably attain that degree of goodness, which will insure,
<lb/>for themselves, a sound reputation as artists, and for the public,
<lb/>a lasting and welcome gratification. Die Schweizer Familie is the
<lb/>next opera, and the managers could not have made a better selec-
<lb break="no"/>tion.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Burke has announced a second Concert at Niblo’s. We
<lb/>have not seen any programme, but we suppose that Mr. Burke’s
<lb/>reputation alone will fill the house.</p><p></p><p>Miss Northall’s Concert in Brooklyn, on Monday evening
<lb/>last, was attended by one of the most fashionable audiences.
<lb/>She sang, encores and all, nine times; and the Gypsey in the
<lb/>North, a very difficult composition by the by, was given so well
<lb/>that repeated acclamations of delight during the performance, and
<lb/>a thunder of applause at the end of it, were her just reward.
<lb/>The duetts with Signor de Begnis were excellent, and we did not
<lb/>find the dragging we usually noticed in these pieces. Mr. Timm
<lb/>was as usual, and he seems to be the same favorite in Brooklyn
<lb/>as in New York.</p><p>From Firth, Hall &amp; Pond, we have received
La Belle Bohémienne: a favorite Polka, by Henri Herz. This
<pb n="376"/>
</p><p>composition is certainly more characteristic than many, from the
<lb/>same source, which have been issued so liberally within the last
<lb/>eight months. As it is easy, it will, no doubt, command a large
<lb/>sale.</p><p></p><p>Devilshoof Quick Step arranged from the Opera of the Bohemian
<lb/>Girl, by Allen Dodworth. This composition comes out a day
<lb/>after the fair, for the whole Opera is almost forgotten by this
<lb/>time. It is arranged very nicely, and we are glad to see for once,
<lb/>a piece clear of the gross faults with which arrangements of the
<lb/>kind generally abound.</p><p></p><p>The Freshness of Life's Early Spring, a song composed by Ben-
<lb break="no"/>jamin S. Hart. The whole melody seems to be the first part of

</p><p>Hunt has somewhat improved his language since his palmy days,
<lb/>when he wrote the Lingua Cockneyana, and was truculently black-
<lb break="no"/>guarded by Christopher North. He still retains, however, a portion
<lb/>of the old leaven, and some of his vulgar smartness and “jaunti-
<lb break="no"/>ness,” may be discerned with no microscopic eye in many of the
<lb/>passages quoted. His old coined words, “sphery,” “prosaical-
<lb break="no"/>ness,” “unsuperfluousness.” “one-ness,” &amp;c., still occasionally
<lb/>flutter round his pen, and force themselves in, despite his better
<lb/>judgment. He speaks of “Bottom and his brother mechanicals”
<lb/>in Midsummer’s Night Dream, and defines Count Cenci, in Shelley’s
<lb/>magnificent tragedy, to be a “potent ruffian.” Sometimes, indeed,
<lb/>he ambitiously attempts a higher flight than his ordinary, careless,
<lb/>slip-shod, chatty, rambling style, and then his hippogriff, ascend-
<lb break="no"/>ing into unaccustomed regions, becomes so utterly bewildered, that
<lb/>its devious course can scarcely be traced. How lucid is the follow-
<lb break="no"/>ing final definition of verse. He evidently feels that in it he has
<lb/>exhausted the subject; there is nothing more to be said concerning
<lb/>it, and that from so self-evident a decision there is no appeal.</p><p></p><p>Verse, in short, is that finishing and rounding, and ‘ tuneful
<lb/>planeting' of the poet’s creations, which is produced of necessity
<lb/>by the smooth tendencies of their energy, or inward working, and
<lb/>the harmonious dance into which they are attracted round the orb
<lb/>of the beautiful.</p><p></p><p>Well done! We especially like that idea of the poet’s creations
<lb/>skipping it on the light fantastic toe, and many-twinkling feet, round
<lb/>the “orb of the beautiful.” The only regret it leaves with us is,
<lb/>that we have not been there to see it.</p><p></p><p>Of Leigh Hunt, it may verily be said “nihil quod, teligit non
<lb/>inquinavit."* He attempts to praise nothing that he does not tend
<lb/>to lower in our estimation. His panegyric on Shelley, in “Byron
<lb/>and his Cotemporaries,” for a while almost gave us a dislike to that
<lb/>noble and nearly blameless character. He has a trifling, childish
<lb/>manner of praising, that frequently disgusts one with the objects of
<lb/>his admiration. How disagreeable are the following remarks con-
<lb break="no"/>cerning Shakspeare, whom he is comparing with Dante!</p><p></p><p>It is far better, that as a higher, more universal, and more benefi-
<lb break="no"/>cent variety of the genus Poet, he should have been the happier man
<lb/>he was, and left us the plump cheeks on his monument, instead of
<lb/>the carking visage of the great, but over-serious and one-sided Flo-
<lb break="no"/>rentine. Even the imagination of Spenser, whom we take to have
<lb/>been a “nervous gentleman” compared with Shakspeare, was vis-
<lb break="no"/>ited with no such dreams as Dante. Or, if it was, he did not choose
<lb/>to make himself thinner, (as Dante says he did,) with dwelling upon
<lb/>them. He had twenty visions of nymphs and bowers, to one of the
<lb/>mud of Tartarus.</p><p>• Mem. This is not our Latin .—Ed. B. J.

NARRATIVE OF A MISSION TO BOKHARA,
In the year 1843-45, to ascertain the fate of Col. Stoddart and
Capt. Conolly.
By the Rev. Joseph Wolff, LL.D.
</p><p>“This work has created a prodigious excitement throughout
<lb/>England; it is unique in its character, as a literary production. It
<lb/>seems to partake of the features of an autobiography; the narrative
<lb/>being full of personal detail, description of the perilous adventure
<lb/>and imminent hazard of the author, in his expedition through the
<lb/>East. No man living, perhaps, has traveled so extensively as this
<lb/>celebrated individual, and few could have contributed a more in-
<lb break="no"/>tensely interesting narrative of his experience.</p><p></p><p>“It will thus be seen that this extraordinary and eccentric man
<lb/>is admirably qualified to present a transcript of Asiatic Character-
<lb break="no"/>istics,—supplying much that is novel and exceedingly curious about
<lb/>tribes and nations of which we know so little To say that the
<lb/>work is an acceptable addition to the library of travel, is affirming
<lb/>far too little of so striking a production: it is a book that ought to
<lb/>be read and deliberately enjoyed by every intelligent person, for its
<lb/>quaintness, freshness, and superabounding interest. The work is
<lb/>elegantly printed as a library book, and aderned by some dozen curi-

</p><p>* Caution.—Large quantities of Hyson Skin are retailed in this
<lb/>market as being a Hyson Tea. It is well worth while to compare
<lb/>the Hyson Tea usually sold at 75 cents with the genuine article
<lb/>that the company offer at the same price. The difference is so per-
<lb break="no"/>ceptible, on trial, as to render any further comment unnecessary.</p><p></p><p>Monstrous Fraud.—Gunpowder and Imperial Teas cannot be
<lb/>retailed by small dealers, in this country, at 75 cents per pound,
<lb/>because they frequently cost that money in China, and no Importer
<lb/>in this city can sell good Gunpowder or Imperial Tea at a less prica
<lb/>than 75 cents per pound by the hundred packages. T. F. Davies,
<lb/>Esq., in his interesting work on China, details the manner in
<lb/>which he saw the lowest grades of Black Teas manufactured and
<lb/>colored with Prussian Blue, so as to closely imitate Gunpowder and
<lb/>Imperial Teas, and adds, the Prussian Blue being a combination of
<lb/>Prussic Acid with Iron, is of course a dangerous poison. Let pur-
<lb break="no"/>chasers therefore beware of adulterated teas, and deal with those
<lb/>venders whose characters and resources raise them above suspicion.
<lb/>Beware of the Gunpowder and Imperial Teas retailed at 75 cents
<lb/>per pound, and compare them with the genuine article sold by the
<lb/>Pekin Tea Company. No one, it is presumed, wishes to drink
<lb/>poison. The company have published a book, giving full details on
<lb/>this subject, which may be had at their warehouse, 75 Fulton street,
<lb/>free of charge.</p><p>Recommendations.
</p><p>We drink Green Tea, and for many years have been paying one
<lb/>dollar per pound for it. But thanks to the Pekin Tea Company, we
<lb/>now get a better tea from them at 75 cents per pound. We drink one
<lb/>pound per week, by which we are now saving thirteen dollars per year,
<lb/>and enjoying better tea in the bargain. Commend us to the Pekin Tea
<lb/>Company, say we.—[Mirror.</p><p></p><p>The Pekin Tea Company, 75 Fulton street, are performing a great
<lb/>and good work, and will, in a few years, beyond all doubt, drive all the
<lb/>poor teas which have deluged this country, and defrauded consumers
<lb/>of the article, out of the market. They import none but pure and fra-</p><p></p><p>grant teas, and retail them by the single pound at wholesale prices.
<lb/>Families are always sure of obtaining good teas at this great tea ware-
<lb break="no"/>house, in quantities to suit their convenience, and at the same price
<lb/>that the merchant pays who buys to sell again.—[Daily True Sun.</p><p></p><p>You may be sure of obtaining at all times, pure and highly flavored
<lb/>teas, by the single pound, at wholesale prices, of the Pekin Tea Com-
<lb break="no"/>pany, 75 Fulton street. They have probably the largest stock, and
<lb/>greatest variety of green and black teas, of any one establishment in
<lb/>the United States. They are doing a large business, and a great benefit
<lb/>to consumers of tea.—[Atlas.</p><p></p><p>Heretofore it has been very difficult, indeed impossible, to always
<lb/>obtain good green and black teas; but now you have only to visit the
<lb/>ware:rooms of the Pekin Tea Company, 75 Fulton street, to obtain as
<lb/>delicious and fragrant teas as you could wish for.—Daily Sun.</p><p>If any of our readers desire to have good tea, they can obtain it of

</p><p>A Word to Tea Drinkers.—The Pekin Tea Company, 75 Fulton
<lb/>street, have imported into this market some five hundred thousand dol-
<lb break="no"/>lars worth of the finest grade of green and black teas, grown in the
<lb/>Celestial Empire, done up in all the various fancy packages that Chi-
<lb break="no"/>nese ingenuity can invent. It is a privilege to buy teas at this great
<lb/>establishment, and a luxury and comfort to drink them. They sell
<lb/>good teas only, and retail them at wholesale prices. Country merchants
<lb/>who wish to always sell good teas can always obtain them at this place,
<lb/>on reasonable terms.—[Emporium.</p><p></p><p>The Pekin Tea Company.—We very cheerfully call the attention
<lb/>of all lovers of pure and fragrant Teas, both in town and country, to the
<lb/>great tea warehouse of this company. Our long acquaintance with the
<lb/>proprietors enables us to bespeak for them the entire confidence of the
<lb/>public. We know that their teas, both in quality and price, are all that
<lb/>is stated of them. Many a lover of the fragrant herb has been com-
<lb break="no"/>piled to eschew the drinking of tea in consequence of its injurious
<lb/>effects, until at length he has become hopeless of finding, among any of
<lb/>the imported varieties of tea in our market, a kind which had not such
<lb/>an effect. In this, however, such persons will be agreeably disappointed.
<lb/>The Pekin Tea Company have commenced the importation of choice
<lb/>varieties of Garden Teas, of most delicious flavor—cultivated and
<lb/>picked with great care, which have heretofore never been introduced
<lb/>into this country, except as presents to importers. Among these they
<lb/>have an Oolong, mild as zephyr, and fragrant as a rose, which we es-
<lb break="no"/>pecially recommend to all nervous persons. Its effect upon many of
<lb/>those who have tried it, is to make them confirmed tea-drinkers. Ladies
<lb/>who have tried it say they never before drank such tea. But all tastes
<lb/>can here be suited, with the great advantage over other stores of getting
<lb/>a pure article at wholesale price, however small the quantity. The
<lb/>company's warehouse is at 75 Fulton street.—[New World.</p><p></p><p>Tea.—The Pekin Tea Company, No. 75Fulton street, unquestionably
<lb/>sell the best teas imported into this market. That they sell them
<lb/>cheaper than any other establishment, is a fact proven in a thousand
<lb/>instances since they have opened their store.</p><p></p><p>We would advise our friends to call at this place, and if they don’t
<lb/>wish to buy, at least to obtain a little pamphlet, kept on their counter,
<lb/>entitled “Hints to Tea-Drinkers,” and therefrom learn a little useful
<lb/>information on the subject. The pamphlet is given gratis.—[Anglo-
<lb break="no"/>American.</p><p></p><p>The finest specimens of green and black teas ever sold in this
