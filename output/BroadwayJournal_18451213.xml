Coquette’s Song.
Ah yes—gentle sir—I will own
I ne’er saw perfection till now;
That I never—no never—have known
A smile such as yours—I’ll allow.
And your eyes—Oh, they speak to the soul
With their glances as bright as the day!
But I mean to keep my heart whole—
So away with your love-vows—away.
Away—Away—
Away with your love-vows—away!
Ah! ne’er such a voice, I’ll confess,
In its low, murmuring tones have I heard,
So deep with emotion’s excess—
Yet soft as the tones of a bird.
Oh! the thrilling and sweet melody
Might melt any heart to your sway—
But dearly I love to be free—
So away with your love-vows—away—
Away—away—
Away with your love-vows—away!
No, no—I assure you ’tis vain
To sigh, and to plead, and to woo.;
But I’ll own, if I could wear a chain,
I would have it—yes—woven by you.
Some future time—may be—but now
I’ll be free as a bird on the spray!
I wont—wont be fettered—I vow;
So away with your love-talk—away—
Away—away.
Away with your love.talk—away!

The Oblong Box.
</p><p>Some years ago, I engaged passage from Charleston, S. C., to
<lb/>the city of New York, in the fine packet-ship “Independence,”
<lb/>Captain Hardy. We were to sail on the fifteenth of the month
<lb/>(June,) weather permitting; and, on the fourteenth, I went on
<lb/>board to arrange some matters in my state-room.</p><p></p><p>I found that we were to have a great many passengers, in-
<lb break="no"/>cluding a more than usual number of ladies. On the list were
<lb/>several of my acquaintances; and, among other names, I was re-
<lb break="no"/>joiced to Bee that of Mr. Cornelius Wyatt, a young artist, for
<lb/>whom I entertained feelings of warm friendship. He had been</p><p>with me a fellow student at C―University, where we were
</p><p>very much together. He had the ordinary temperament of genius,
<lb/>and was a compound of misanthropy, sensibility, and enthusiasm.
<lb/>To these qualities he united the warmest and truest heart which
<lb/>ever beat in a human bosom.</p><p></p><p>I observed that his name was carded upon three state-rooms;
<lb/>and, upon again referring to the list of passengers, I found that
<lb/>he had engaged passage for himself, wife, and two sisters—his
<lb/>own. The state-rooms were sufficiently roomy, and each had
<lb/>two berths, one above the other. These berths, to be sure, were
<lb/>so exceedingly narrow as to be insufficient for more than one
<lb/>person; still, I could not comprehend why there were three state-
<lb break="no"/>rooms for these four persons. I was, just at that epoch, in one
<lb/>of those moody frames of mind which make a man abnormally
<lb/>inquisitive about trifles; and I confess, with shame, that I busied
<lb/>myself in a variety of ill-bred and preposterous conjectures about
<lb/>this matter of the supernumerary state-room. It was no business
<lb/>of mine, to be sure; but with none the less pertinacity did I oc-
<lb break="no"/>cupy myself in attempts to resolve the enigma. At last I reached
<lb/>a conclusion which wrought in me great wonder why I had not
<lb/>arrived at it before, “It is a servant, of course,” I said; “what
<lb/>a fool I am, not sooner to have thought of so obvious a solution!”
<lb/>And then I again repaired to the list—but here I saw distinctly
<lb/>that no servant was to come with the party; although, in fact,
<lb/>it had been the original design to bring one—for the words “and
<lb/>servant” had been first written and then overscored. “Oh, extra
<lb/>baggage to be sure,” I now said to myself—“ something he wishes
<lb/>not to be put in the hold—something to be kept under his own
<lb/>eye—ah, I have it—a painting or so—and this is what he has
<lb/>been bargaining about with Nicolino, the Italian Jew.” This
<lb/>idea satisfied me, and I dismissed my curiosity for the nonce.</p><p></p><p>Wyatt’s two sisters I knew very well, and most amiable and
<lb/>clever girls they were. His wife he had newly married, and I
<lb/>had never yet seen her. He had often talked about her in my
<lb/>presence, however, and in his usual style of enthusiasm. He
<lb/>described her as of surpassing beauty, wit, and accomplishment.
<lb/>I was, therefore, quite anxious to make her acquaintance.</p><p></p><p>On the day is which I visited the ship, (the fourteenth,) Wyatt
<lb/>and party were also to visit it—so the captain informed me—and
<lb/>I waited on board an hour longer than I had designed, in hope of
<lb/>being presented to the bride; but then an apology came. “Mrs.
<lb/>W. was a little indisposed, and would decline coming on board
<lb/>until to-morrow, at the hour of sailing.”</p><p></p><p>The morrow having arrived, I was going from my hotel to the
<lb/>wharf, when Captain Hardy met me and said that, “owing to
<lb/>circumstances,” (a stupid but convenient phrase,) “he rather
<lb/>thought the ‘Independence’ would not sail for a day or two, and
<lb/>that when all was ready, he would send up and let me know.”
<lb/>This I thought strange, for there was a stiff southerly breeze;
<lb/>but as “the circumstances” were not forthcoming, although I
<lb/>pumped for them with much perseverance, I had nothing to do
<lb/>but to return home and digest my impatience at leisure.</p><p></p><p>I did not receive the expected message from the captain for
<lb/>nearly a week. It came at length, however, and I immediately
<lb/>wont on board. The ship was crowded with passengers, and
<lb/>everything was in the bustle attendant upon making sail. Wyatt’s
<lb/>party arrived in about ten minutes after myself. There were the
<lb/>two sisters, the bride, and the artist—the latter in one of his cus-
<lb break="no"/>tomary fits of moody misanthropy. I was too well used to these,
<lb/>however, to pay them any especial attention. He did not even</p><p><pb n="350"/>
</p><p>introduce me to his wife;—this courtesy devolving, perforce, upon
<lb/>his sister Marian—a very sweet and intelligent girl, who, in a
<lb/>few hurried words, made us acquainted.</p><p></p><p>Mrs. Wyatt had been closely veiled; and when she raised her
<lb/>veil, in acknowledging my bow, I confess that I was very pro-
<lb break="no"/>foundly astonished. I should have been much more so, however,
<lb/>had not long experience advised me not to trust, with too inplicit
<lb/>a reliance, the enthusiastic descriptions of my friend, the artist,
<lb/>when indulging in comments upon the loveliness of woman.
<lb/>When beauty was the theme, I well knew with what facility he
<lb/>soared into the regions of the purely ideal.</p><p></p><p>The truth is, I could not help regarding Mrs. Wyatt as a de-
<lb break="no"/>cidedly plain-looking woman. If not positively ugly, she was
<lb/>not, I think, very far from it. She was dressed, however, in ex-
<lb break="no"/>quisite taste—and then I had no doubt that she had captivated
<lb/>my friend’s heart by the more enduring graces of the intellect and
<lb/>soul. She said very few words and passed at once into her state-
<lb break="no"/>room with Mr. W.</p><p></p><p>My old inquisitiveness now returned. There was no servant
<lb/>—that was a settled point. I looked, therefore, for the extra
<lb/>baggage. After some delay, a cart arrived at the wharf, with an
<lb/>oblong pine box, which was everything that seeemed to be ex-
<lb break="no"/>pected. Immediately upon its arrival we made sail, and in a
<lb/>short time were safely over the bar and standing out to sea.</p><p></p><p>The box in question was, as I say, oblong. It was about six
<lb/>feet in length by two and a half in breadth;—I observed it atten-
<lb break="no"/>tively, and like to be precise. Now this shape was peculiar;
<lb/>and no sooner had I seen it, than I took credit to myself for the
<lb/>accuracy of my guessing. I had reached the conclusion, it will
<lb/>be remembered, that the extra baggage of my friend, the artist,
<lb/>would prove to be pictures, or at least a picture; for I knew he
<lb/>had been for several weeks in conference with Nicolino:—and
<lb/>now here was a box which, from its shape, could possibly con-
<lb break="no"/>tain nothing in the world but a copy of Leonardo’s “Last Sup-
<lb break="no"/>per and a copy of this very “Last Supper,” done by Rubini
<lb/>the younger, at Florence, I had known, for some time, to be in
<lb/>the possession of Nicolino. This point, therefore, I considered
<lb/>as sufficiently settled. I chuckled excessively when I thought of
<lb/>my acumen. It was the first time I had ever known Wyatt to
<lb/>keep from me any of his artistical secrets; but here he evidently
<lb/>intended to steal a march upon me, and smuggle a fine picture to
<lb/>New York, under my very nose; expecting me to know nothing
<lb/>of the matter. I resolved to quiz him well, now and hereafter.</p><p></p><p>One thing, however, annoyed me not a little. The box did not
<lb/>go into the extra state-room. It was deposited in Wyatt's own;
<lb/>and there, too, it remained, occupying very nearly the whole of
<lb/>the floor—no doubt to the exceeding discomfort of the artist and
<lb/>his wife;—this the more especially as the tar or paint with
<lb/>which it was lettered in sprawling capitals, emitted a strong, dis-
<lb break="no"/>agreeable, and, to my fancy, a peculiarly disgusting odor. On
<lb/>the lid were painted the words—“Mrs. Adelaide Curtis, Al-
<lb break="no"/>bany, New York. Charge of Cornelius Wyatt, Esq. This side
<lb/>up. To be handled with care."</p><p></p><p>Now, I was aware that Mrs. Adelaide Curtis, of Albany, was
<lb/>the artist’s wife’s mother;—but then I looked upon the whole ad-
<lb break="no"/>dress as a mystification, intended especially for myself. I made
<lb/>up my mind, of course, that the box and contents would never
<lb/>get farther north than the studio of my misanthropic friend, in
<lb/>Chambers Street, New York.</p><p></p><p>For the first three or four days we had fine weather, although
<lb/>the wind was dead ahead; having chopped round to the north-
<lb break="no"/>ward, immediately upon our losing sight of the coast. The pas-
<lb break="no"/>sengers were, consequently, in high spirits, and disposed to be
<lb/>social. I must except, however, Wyatt and his sisters, who be-</p><p></p><p>haved stiffly, and, I could not help thinking, uncourteously to the
<lb/>rest of the party. Wyatt's conduct I did not so much regard. He
<lb/>was gloomy, even beyond his usual habit—in fact he was morose
<lb/>—but in him I was prepared for eccentricity. For the sisters,
<lb/>however, I could make no excuse. They secluded themselves in
<lb/>their state-rooms during the greater part of the passage, and ab-
<lb break="no"/>solutely refused, although I repeatedly urged them, to hold com-
<lb break="no"/>muication with any person on board.</p><p></p><p>Mrs. Wyatt herself, was far more agreeable. That is to say,
<lb/>she was chatty; and to be chatty is no slight recommendation
<lb/>at sea. She became excessively intimate with most of- the ladies;
<lb/>and, to my profound astonishment, evinced no equivocal disposi-
<lb break="no"/>tion to coquet with the men. She amused us all very much. I
<lb/>say “amused’’—and scarcely know how to explain myself. The
<lb/>truth is, I soon found that Mrs. W. was far oftener laughed at
<lb/>than with. The gentlemen said little about her; but the ladies,
<lb/>in a little while, pronounced her “a good-hearted thing, rather
<lb/>indifferent-looking, totally uneducated, and decidedly vulgar.”
<lb/>The great wonder was, how Wyatt had been entrapped into such
<lb/>a match. Wealth was the general solution—but this I knew to
<lb/>be no solution at all; for Wyatt had told me that she neither
<lb/>brought him a dollar nor had any expectations from any source
<lb/>whatever. “He had married,” he said, “for love, and for love
<lb/>only; and his bride was far more than worthy of his love.’
<lb/>When I thought of these expressions, on the part of my friend,
<lb/>l confess that I felt indescribably puzzled. Could it be possible
<lb/>that he was taking leave of his senses? What else could I think?
<lb/>He, so refined, so intellectual, so fastidious, with so exquisite a
<lb/>perception of the faulty, and so keen an appreciation of the beau-
<lb break="no"/>tiful! To be sure, the lady seemed especially fond of him—par-
<lb break="no"/>ticularly so in his absence—when she made herself ridiculous by
<lb/>frequent quotations of what had been said by her “beloved hus-
<lb break="no"/>band, Mr. Wyatt.” The word “husband” seemed forever—to
<lb/>use one of her own delicate expressions—forever “on the tip
<lb/>of her tongue.” In the mean time, it was observed by all on
<lb/>board, that he avoided her in the most pointed manner, and, for
<lb/>the most part, shut himself up alone in his state-room, where, in
<lb/>fact, he might have been said to live altogether, leaving his wife
<lb/>at full liberty to amuse herself as she thought best, in the public
<lb/>society of the main cabin.</p><p></p><p>My conclusion, from what I saw and heard, was, that the art-
<lb break="no"/>ist, by some unaccountable freak of fate, or perhaps in some fit
<lb/>of enthusiastic and fanciful passion, had been induced to unite
<lb/>himself with a person altogether beneath him, and that the natu-
<lb break="no"/>ral result, entire and speedy disgust, had ensued. I pitied him
<lb/>from the bottom of my heart—but could not, for that reason,
<lb/>quite forgive his incommunicativeness in the matter of the “Last
<lb/>Supper.” For this I resolved to have my revenge.</p><p></p><p>One day he came upon deck, and, taking bis arm as had been
<lb/>my wont, I sauntered with him backwards and forwards. His
<lb/>gloom, however, (which I considered quite natural under the cir-
<lb break="no"/>cumstances,) seemed entirely unabated. He said little, and tha
<lb/>moodily, and with evident effort. I ventured a jest or two, and
<lb/>he made a sickening attempt at a smile. Poor fellow!—as I
<lb/>thought of his wife, I wondered that he could have heart to
<lb/>put on even the semblance of mirth. At last I ventured a home
<lb/>thrust. I determined to commence a series of covert insinuations,
<lb/>or inuendoes, about the oblong box—just to let him perceive,
<lb/>gradually, that I was not altogether the butt, or victim, of his
<lb/>little bit of pleasant mystification. My first observation was by
<lb/>way of opening a masked battery. I said something about the
<lb/>“peculiar shape of that box;" and, as I spoke the words, I
<lb/>smiled knowingly, winked, and touched him gently with my fore-
<lb break="no"/>finger in the ribs.</p><p><pb n="351"/>
</p><p>The manner in which Wyatt received this harmless pleasantry, 
<lb/>convinced me, at once, that he was mad. At first he stared at
<lb/>me as if he found it impossible to comprehend the witticism of
<lb/>my remark; but as its point seemed slowly to make its way into
<lb/>his brain, his eyes, in the same proportion, seemed protruding
<lb/>from their sockets. Then he grew very red—then hideously
<lb/>pale—then, as if highly amused with what I had insinuated, he
<lb/>began a loud and boisterous laugh, which, to my astonishment,
<lb/>he kept up, with gradually increasing vigor, for ten minutes or
<lb/>more. In conclusion, he fell flat and heavily upon the deck.
<lb/>When I ran to uplift him, to all appearance he was dead.</p><p></p><p>I called assistance, and, with much difficulty, we brought him
<lb/>to himself. Upon reviving he spoke incoherently for some time.
<lb/>At length we bled him and put him to bed. The next morning
<lb/>he was quite recovered, so far as regarded his mere bodily health.
<lb/>Of his mind I say nothing, of course. I avoided him during the
<lb/>rest of the passage, by advice of the captain, who seemed to coin-
<lb break="no"/>cide with me altogether in my views of his insanity, but cau-
<lb break="no"/>tioned me to say nothing on this head to any person on board.</p><p></p><p>Several circumstances occurred immediately after this fit of
<lb/>Wyatt’s, which contributed to heighten the curiosity with which
<lb/>I was already possessed. Among other things, this: I had been
<lb/>nervous—drank too much strong green tea, and slept ill at night
<lb/>—in fact, for two nights I could not be properly said to sleep at
<lb/>all. Now, my state-room opened into the main cabin, or dining-
<lb break="no"/>room, as did those of all the single men on board. Wyatt’s three
<lb/>rooms were in the after-cabin, which was separated from the
<lb/>main one by a slight sliding door, never locked even at night.
<lb/>As we were almost constantly on a wind, and the breeze was
<lb/>not a little stiff, the ship heeled to leeward very considerably;
<lb/>and whenever her starboard side was to leeward, the sliding
<lb/>door between the cabins slid open, and so remained, nobody tak-
<lb break="no"/>ing the trouble to get up and shut it. But my berth was in such
<lb/>a position, that when my own state-room door was open, as well
<lb/>as the sliding door in question, (and my own door was always
<lb/>open on account of the heat,) I could see into the after-cabin quite
<lb/>distinctly, and just at that portion of it, too, where were situated
<lb/>the state-rooms of Mr. Wyatt. Well, during two nights (not
<lb/>consecutive) while I lay awake, I clearly saw Mrs. W., about
<lb/>eleven o’clock upon each night, steal cautiously from the state-
<lb break="no"/>room of Mr. W. and enter the extra room, where she remained
<lb/>until daybreak, when she was called by her husband and went
<lb/>back. That they were virtually separated was clear. They had
<lb/>separate apartments—no doubt in contemplation of a more per-
<lb break="no"/>manent divorce; and here, after all, I thought, was the mystery
<lb/>of the extra state-room.</p><p></p><p>There was another circumstance, too, which interested me
<lb/>much. During the two wakeful nights in question, and imme-
<lb break="no"/>diately after the disappearance of Mrs. Wyatt into the extra state-
<lb break="no"/>room, I was attracted by certain singular, cautious, subdued
<lb/>noises in that of her husband. After listening to them for some
<lb/>time, with thoughtful attention, I at length succeeded perfectly
<lb/>in translating their import. They were sounds occasioned by the
<lb/>artist in prying open the oblong box, by means of a chisel and
<lb/>mallet—the latter being apparently muffled, or deadened, by some
<lb/>soft woollen or cotton substance in which its head was enveloped.</p><p></p><p>In this manner I fancied I could distinguish the precise moment
<lb/>when he fairly disengaged the lid—also, that I could determine
<lb/>when he removed it altogether, and when he deposited it upon
<lb/>the lower berth in his room; this latter point I knew, for exam-
<lb break="no"/>ple, by certain slight taps which the lid made in striking against
<lb/>the wooden edges of the berth, as he endeavored to lay it down
<lb/>very gently—there being no room for it on the floor. After this
<lb/>there was a dead stillness, and I heard nothing more, upon either</p><p></p><p> occasion, until nearly daybreak; unless, perhaps, I may mention
<lb/>a low sobbing, or murmuring sound, so very much suppressed as
<lb/>to be nearly inaudible—if, indeed, the whole of this latter noise
<lb/>were not rather produced by my own imagination. I say it
<lb/>seemed to resemble sobbing or sighing—but, of course, it could
<lb/>not have been either. I rather think it was a ringing in my own
<lb/>ears. Mr. Wyatt, no doubt, according to custom, was merely
<lb/>giving the rein to one of his hobbies—indulging in one of his fits
<lb/>of artistic enthusiasm. He had opened his oblong box, in order
<lb/>to feast his eyes on the pictorial treasure within. There was no-
<lb break="no"/>thing in this, however, to make him sob. I repeat therefore, that
<lb/>it must have been simply a freak of my own fancy, distempered
<lb/>by good Captain Hardy’s green tea. Just before dawn, on each
<lb/>of the two nights of which I speak, I distinctly heard Mr. Wyatt
<lb/>replace the lid upon the oblong box, and force the nails into their
<lb/>old places, by means of the muffled mallet. Having done this
<lb/>he issued from his stale-room, fully dressed, and proceeded to call
<lb/>Mrs. W. from hers.</p><p></p><p>We had been at sea seven days, and were now off Cape Hatteras,
<lb/>when there came on a tremendously heavy blow from the south-
<lb break="no"/>west. We were, in a measure, prepared for it, however, as the
<lb/>weather had been holding out threats for some time. Everything
<lb/>was made snug, alow and aloft; and as the wind steadily fresh-
<lb break="no"/>ened, we lay to, at length, under spanker and foretopsail, both
<lb/>double-reefed.</p><p></p><p>In this trim, we rode safely enough for forty-eight hours—the
<lb/>ship proving herself an excellent sea boat, in many respects, and
<lb/>shipping no water of any consequence. At the end of this period,
<lb/>however, the gale had freshened into a hurricane, and our after-
<lb break="no"/>sail split into ribbons, bringing us so much in the trough of the
<lb/>water that we shipped several prodigious seas, one immediately
<lb/>after the other. By this accident we lost three men overboard,
<lb/>with the caboose, and nearly the whole of the larboard bulwarks.
<lb/>Scarcely had we recovered our senses, before the foretopsail went
<lb/>into shreds, when we got up a storm stay-sail, and with this did
<lb/>pretty well for some hours, the ship heading the seas much more
<lb/>steadily than before.</p><p></p><p>The gale still held on, however, and we saw no signs of its
<lb/>abating. The rigging was found to be ill-fitted, and greatly
<lb/>strained; and on the third day of the blow, about five in the
<lb/>afternoon, our mizzen-mast, in a heavy lurch to windward, went
<lb/>by the board. For an hour or more, we tried in vain to get rid
<lb/>of it, on account of the prodigious rolling of the ship; and,
<lb/>before we had succeeded, the carpenter came aft and announced
<lb/>four feet water in the hold. To add to our dilemma, we found
<lb/>the pumps choked and nearly useless.</p><p></p><p>All was now confusion and despair—but an effort was made
<lb/>to lighten the ship by throwing overboard as much of her cargo
<lb/> as could be reached, and by cutting away the two masts that
<lb/>remained. This we at last accomplished—but we were still
<lb/>unable to do anything at the pumps; and, in the mean time, the
<lb/>leak gained on us very fast.</p><p></p><p>At sundown, the gale had sensibly diminished in violence, and,
<lb/>as the sea went down with it, we still entertained faint hopes of
<lb/>saving ourselves in the boats. At eight, P. M., the clouds broke
<lb/>away to windward, and we had the advantage of a full moon
<lb/>—a piece of good fortune which served wonderfully to cheer our
<lb/> drooping spirits.</p><p></p><p>After incredible labor we succeeded, at length, in getting the
<lb/> long-boat over the side without material accident, and into this
<lb/>we crowded the whole of the crew and roost of the passengers.</p><p></p><p> This party made off immediately, and, after undergoing much suf-
<lb break="no"/>fering, finally arrived, in safety, at Ocracoke Inlet, on the third
<lb/>day after the wreck.</p><p><pb n="352"/>
</p><p>Fourteen passengers, with the Captain, remained on board,
<lb/>resolving to trust their fortunes to the jolly-boat at the stern.
<lb/>We lowered it without difficulty, although it was only by a mira-
<lb break="no"/>cle that we prevented it from swamping as it touched the water.
<lb/>It contained, when afloat, the captain and his wife, Mr. Wyatt
<lb/>and party, a Mexican officer, wife, four children, and myself,
<lb/>with a negro valet.</p><p></p><p>We had no room, of course, for anything except a few posi-
<lb break="no"/>tively necessary instruments, some provision, and the clothes
<lb/>upon our backs. No one had thought of even attempting to
<lb/>save anything more. What must have been the astonishment
<lb/>of all then, when, having proceeded a few fathoms from the ship,
<lb/>Mr. Wyatt stood up in the stern-sheets, and coolly demanded of
<lb/>Captain Hardy that the boat should be put back for the purpose
<lb/>of taking in his oblong box!</p><p></p><p>“Sit down, Mr. Wyatt,” replied the Captain, somewhat sternly;
<lb/>“you will capsize us if you do not sit quite still. Our gunwale
<lb/>is almost in the water now.”</p><p></p><p>“The box!” vociferated Mr. Wyatt, still standing—“the box,
<lb/>I say! Captain Hardy, you cannot, you will not refuse me. Its
<lb/>weight will be but a trifle—it is nothing—mere nothing. By the
<lb/>mother who bore you—for the love of Heaven—by your hope of
<lb/>salvation, I implore you to put back for the box!”</p><p></p><p>The Captain, for a moment, seemed touched by the earnest
<lb/>appeal of the artist, but he regained his stern composure, and
<lb/>merely said—</p><p>“Mr. Wyatt, you are mad. I cannot listen to you. Sit down,
I say, or you will swamp the boat. Stay—hold him—seize him!
—he is about to spring overboard! There—I knew it—he is over!
</p><p>As the Captain said this, Mr. Wyatt, in fact, sprang from the
<lb/>boat, and, as we were yet in the lee of the wreck, succeeded, by
<lb/>almost superhuman exertion, in getting hold of a rope which
<lb/>hung from the fore-chains. In another moment he was on board,
<lb/>and rushing frantically down into the cabin.</p><p></p><p>In the meantime, we had been swept astern of the ship, and
<lb/>being quite out of her lee, were at the mercy of the tremendous
<lb/>sea which was still running. We made a determined effort to
<lb/>put back, but our little boat was like a feather in the breath of
<lb/>the tempest. We saw at a glance that the doom of the unfortu-
<lb break="no"/>nate artist was sealed.</p><p></p><p>As our distance from the wreck rapidly increased, the madman
<lb/>(for as such only could we regard him) was seen to emerge from
<lb/>the companion-way, up which, by dint of a strength that ap-
<lb break="no"/>peared gigantic, he dragged, bodily, the oblong box. While we
<lb/>gazed in the extremity of astonishment, he passed, rapidly, seve-
<lb break="no"/>ral turns of a three-inch rope, first around the box and then
<lb/>around his body. In another instant both body and box were in
<lb/>the sea—disappearing suddenly, at once and forever.</p><p></p><p>We lingered awhile sadly upon our oars, with our eyes riveted
<lb/>upon the spot. At length we pulled away. The silence remained
<lb/>unbroken for an hour. Finally, I hazarded a remark.</p><p></p><p> Did you observe, Captain, how suddenly they sank? Was
<lb/>not that an exceedingly singular thing? I confess that I enter-
<lb break="no"/>tained some feeble hope of his final deliverance, when I saw him
<lb/>lash himself to the box, and commit himself to the sea.”</p><p></p><p>“They sank, as a matter of course,” replied the Captain, “and
<lb/>that like a shot. They will soon rise again, however—but not till
<lb/>the salt melts.”</p><p>“The salt!” I ejaculated.
</p><p>“Hush!” said the Captain, pointing to the wife and sisters of
<lb/>the deceased. “We must talk of these things at some more
<lb/>appropriate time.”</p><p>We suffered much, and made a narrow escape; but fortune
</p><p>befriended us, as well as our mates in the long boat. We landed,
<lb/>in fine, more dead than alive, after four days of intense distress,
<lb/>upon the beach opposite Roanoke Island. We remained here a
<lb/>week, were not ill-treated by the wreckers, and at length obtained
<lb/>a passage to New York.</p><p></p><p>About a month after the loss of the “Independence,” I hap-
<lb break="no"/>pened to meet Captain Hardy in Broadway. Our conversation
<lb/>turned, naturally, upon the disaster, and especially upon the sad
<lb/>fate of poor Wyatt. I thus learned the following particulars.</p><p></p><p>The artist had engaged passage for himself, wife, two sisters
<lb/>and a servant. His wife was, indeed, as she had been repre-
<lb break="no"/>sented, a most lovely, and most accomplished woman. On the
<lb/>morning of the fourteenth of June, (the day in which I first visited
<lb/>the ship,) the lady suddenly sickened and died. The young hus-
<lb break="no"/>band was frantic with grief—but circumstances imperatively for-
<lb break="no"/>bade the deferring his voyage to New York. It was necessary to
<lb/>take to her mother the corpse of his adored wife, and, on the
<lb/>other hand, the universal prejudice which would prevent his doing
<lb/>so openly, was well known. Nine-tenths of the passengers
<lb/>would have abandoned the ship rather than take passage with
<lb/>a dead body.</p><p></p><p>In this dilemma, Captain Hardy arranged that the corpse, being
<lb/>first partially embalmed, and packed, with a large quantity of
<lb/>salt, in a box of suitable dimensions, should be conveyed on
<lb/>board as merchandize. Nothing was to be said of the lady’s
<lb/>decease; and, as it was well understood that Mr. Wyatt had
<lb/>engaged passage for his wife, it became necessary that some
<lb/>person should personate her during the voyage. This the
<lb/>deceased’s lady’s-maid was easily prevailed on to do. The extra
<lb/>state-room, originally engaged for this girl, during her mistress’
<lb/>life, was now merely retained. In this state-room the pseudo
<lb/>wife slept, of course, every night In the day-time she performed,
<lb/>to the best of her ability, the part of her mistress—whose person,
<lb/>it had been carefully ascertained, was unknown to any of the
<lb/>passengers on board.</p><p></p><p>My own mistakes arose, naturally enough, through too care-
<lb break="no"/>less, too inquisitive, and too impulsive a temperament. But of
<lb/>late, it is a rare thing that I sleep soundly at night. There is a
<lb/>countenance which haunts me, turn as I will. There is an hys-
<lb break="no"/>terical laugh which will forever ring within my ears.</p><p>Edgar A. Poe.
A Shipwreck.
I launched a bark on Fate’s deep tide—
A frail and fluttering toy,
But freighted with a thousand dreams
Of beauty and of joy.
Ah me! it found no friend in them—
The wave—the sky—the gale—
Though Love enraptured took the helm—
And Hope unfurled the sail!
And you, who should its pilot be—
To whom in fear it flies—
Forsake it, on a treacherous sea,
To seek a prouder prize.
Alas for Love! bewildered child!
He weeps the helm beside,
And Hope has furled her fairy sail,
Nor longer tempts the tide.
Despair and Pride in silence fling
Its rich freight to the wave,
And now an aimless wreck it floats,
That none would stoop to save. F. S. Osgood.

Poems. By Frances S. Osgood. New- York: Clark &amp; Austin.
</p><p>A neat volume of 252 pages duodecimo, including many but
<lb/>by no means all, or even the best, of the author’s late composi-
<lb break="no"/>tions, with several of those which made up the “Wreath of Wild
<lb/>Flowers from New-England.</p><p>The book opens with these few words of Preface:
</p><p> The Author’s chief fear, in collecting and publishing the fol-
<lb break="no"/>lowing Poems, is that they may not be thought worthy the notice
<lb/>of that just and true criticism, whose praise and blame are alike
<lb/>valuable, and would by her be equally welcomed and appreciated.</p><p></p><p>We have no poetess among us who has been so universally
<lb/>popular as Mrs. Osgood—and yet, with the exception of “The
<lb/>Wreath of Wild Flowers," (an English publication,) this is the
<lb/>first collection of her Poems. Our only regret is that she has not
<lb/>presented us, in one view, all that she has written in verse. In
<lb/>omitting so much, she is in danger of losing the credit to which
<lb/>she is so fairly entitled on the score of versatility—of variety in
<lb/>expression and invention. There is scarcely a form of poetical
<lb/>composition in which she has not made experiment, and there is
<lb/>not one in which she has not very creditably succeeded.</p><p></p><p>Of course, then, it is a task of no little difficulty to give any
<lb/>generalization of her powers. We may say, in the beginning,
<lb/>however, that in no one poetical requisite is she deficient. Her
<lb/>negative merits are of the highest respectability. We look in
<lb/>vain, throughout her writings, for an offence against taste, or
<lb/>decorum—for a low thought—a platitude of expression—a viola-
<lb break="no"/>tion of grammar—or for any of those lapses in the mere techni-
<lb break="no"/>cality of composition, of which, in America, we meet so abundant
<lb/>examples. A happy refinement—an exquisite instinct of the
<lb/>pure—the delicate—the graceful—gives a charm inexpressible to
<lb/>everything which flows from her pen.</p><p></p><p>In respect to the positive merits—to the loftier excellences of
<lb/>the Muse—we are constrained to speak with somewhat more
<lb/>reserve. Deficient—that is to say markedly deficient at no
<lb/>point—Mrs. Osgood has, nevertheless, neither the bold and rich
<lb/>imagination of Maria Brooks—nor the rhythmical ear and glow-
<lb break="no"/>ing fervor of Mrs. Welby—but to no other American poetesses is
<lb/>she, even in these particulars, inferior. A peculiar trait of her
<lb/>mind is its versatility and originality of poetic invention—wheth-
<lb break="no"/>er in the conception of a theme or in the manner and tone of its
<lb/>handling. A portion, or rather a consequence of this trait, is a
<lb/>certain piquancy, point, and epigrammatic terseness of phraseolo-
<lb break="no"/>gy—in which she is approached only by Miss Gould. But it is
<lb/>in that indescribable something which, for want of a more definite
<lb/>term, we are accustomed to call grace—that Will-o’-the-Wisp,
<lb/>which in its supreme development may be said to involve nearly
<lb/>all that is pure and ethereal in poetry—it is in this charm of
<lb/>charms—so magical because at once so shadowy and so irresist-
<lb break="no"/>ible that Mrs. Osgood pre-eminently excels. It is in this that</p><p>she has no equal among her countrywomen, it is this rod of the
enchanter which throws open to her the road to all hearts.
</p><p>In the collection now before us there occur very many of those
<lb/>half sentimental half allegorical or rather emblematical composi-
<lb break="no"/>tions, of which the authoress seems to be especially fond—for the
<lb/>reason, perhaps, that she constructs them with little facility, and
<lb/>that, for their mere ingenuity, they are admired by the mass of
<lb/>mankind. We regret to see these pieces in the volume;—they
<lb/>are, in general, very graceful pleasantries—but no more—and
<lb/>quite unworthy her who could pen so truly consistent and beauti-
<lb break="no"/>ful a prosopopeia as</p><p>THE SPIRIT OF POETRY.
Leave me not yet! Leave me not cold and lonely,
Thou dear Ideal of my pining heart!
Thou art the friend—the beautiful—the only,
Whom I would keep, tho’ all the world depart!
Thou, that dost veil the frailest flower with glory,
Spirit of light and loveliness and truth!
Thou that didst tell me a sweet fairy story
Of the dim future, in my wistful youth!
Thou, who canst weave a halo round the spirit,
</p><p>Through which nought mean or evil dare intrude,
<lb/>Resume not yet the gift, which I inherit
<lb/>From Heaven and thee, that dearest, holiest good!
<lb/>Leave me not now! Leave me not cold and lonely,
<lb/>Thou starry prophet of my pining heart!</p><p>Thou art the friend—the tenderest—the only,
With whom, of all, ’twould be despair to part.
</p><p>Thou that cam’st to me in my dreaming childhood,
<lb/>Shaping the changeful clouds to pageants rare,
<lb/>Peopling the smiling vale, and shaded wildwood,</p><p>With airy beings, faint yet strangely fair;
Telling me all the sea-born breeze was saying,
</p><p>While it went whispering through the willing leaves.
<lb/>Bidding me listen to the light rain playing
<lb/>Its pleasant tune, about the household eaves;</p><p>Tuning the low, sweet ripple of the river,
Till its melodious murmur seem’d a song,
A tender and sad chaunt, repeated ever,
A sweet, impassion’d plaint of love and wrong!
Leave me not yet! Leave me not cold and lonely,
Thou star of promise o’er my clouded path!
Leave not the life that borrows from thee only
All of delight and beauty that it hath!
Thou, that when others knew not how to love me.
Nor cared to fathom half my yearning soul,
Didst wreathe thy flowers of light, around, above me,
To woo and win me from my grief’s control.
By all my dreams, the passionate, and holy,
When thou hast sung love’s lullaby to me—
By all the childlike worship, fond and lowly,
Which I have lavish’d upon thine and thee—
By all the lays my simple lute was learning,
To echo from thy voice, stay with me still!
Once flown—alas! for thee there’s no returning!
The charm will die o’er valley, wood, and hill.
Tell me not Time, whose wing my brow has shaded,
Has wither’d spring’s sweet bloom within my heart.
Ah, no! the rose of Love is yet unfaded,
Though Hope and Joy, its sister flowers, depart.
Well do I know that I have wrong’d thine altar,
With the light offerings of an idler’s mind,
And thus, with shame, my pleading prayer I falter,
Leave me not, spirit! deaf, and dumb, and blind!
Deaf to the mystic harmony of nature,
Blind to the beauty of her stars and flowers!
Leave me not, heavenly yet human teacher,
Lonely and lost in this cold world of ours!
Heaven knows I need thy music and thy beauty
Still to beguile me on my weary way,
To lighten to my soul the cares of duty,
And bless with radiant beams: the darken’d day;
To charm my wild heart in the worldly revel,
Lest I, too, join the aimless, false, and vain;
Let me not lower to the soulless level
Of those whom now I pity and disdain!
<pb n="354"/>
Leave me not yet!—leave me not cold and pining,
Thou bird of paradise, whose plumes of light,
Where’er they rested, left a'glory shining;
Fly not to heaven, or let me share thy flight!
</p><p>Of its kind—a kind not of the highest—there have been written
<lb/>few finer poems than this. It is replete with feeling, with eleva-
<lb break="no"/>ted sentiment—and its versification is correct—sonorous, har-
<lb break="no"/>monious and well-sustained.</p><p>One of the best of Mrs. Osgood’s shorter poems is entitled
SHE LOVES HIM YET.
She loves him yet!
</p><p>I know by the blush that rises
<lb/>Beneath the curls
<lb/>That shadow her soul-lit cheek;</p><p>She loves him yet!
Thro’ all Love’s sweet disguises
In timid girls,
A blush will be sure to speak.
But deeper signs
Than the radiant blush of beauty,
The maiden finds,
Whenever his name is heard.—
Her young heart thrills,
Forgetting herself—her duty—
Her dark eye fills,
And her pulse with hope is stirr’d.
She loves him yet!
The flower the false one gave her
When last he came,
Is still with her wild tears wet.
She'll ne’er forget,
However his faith may waver.
Thro’ grief and shame,
Believe it—she loves him yet!
His favorite songs
She will sing—she heeds no other;
With all her wrongs
Her life on his love is set.
Oh, doubt no more!
She never can wed another:
Till life be o’er,
She loves—she will love him yet!
</p><p>There is in this a rich simplicity which cannot be too highly
<lb/>admired, and the metre is original and otherwise of peculiar
<lb/>excellence.</p><p>We cannot forbear quoting the noble poem entitled
ASPIRATIONS.
I waste no more in idle dreams my life, my soul away:
</p><p>I wake to know my better self,—I wake to watch and pray.
<lb/>Thought, feeling, time, on idols vain, I’ve lavished all too long;
<lb/>Henceforth to holier purposes I pledge myself, my song!</p><p>Oh! still within the inner veil, upon the spirit’s shrine,
</p><p>Still unprofaned by evil, bums the one pure spark divine
<lb/>Which God has kindled in us all, and be it mine to tend
<lb/>Henceforth, with vestal thought and care, the light that lamp may
<lb/>lend.</p><p>I shut mine eyes in grief and shame upon the dreary past—
My heart, my soul pour’d recklessly on dreams that could not last.
My bark has drifted down the stream, at will of wind or wave,
An idle, light, and fragile thing, that few had cared to save.
Henceforth the tiller Truth shall hold, and steer as Conscience tells,
And I will brave the storms of Fate tho’ wild the ocean swells.
I know my soul is strong and high, if once I give it sway;
I feel a glorious power within, tho’ light I seem and gay.
Oh, laggard soul! unclose thine eyes. No more in luxury soft
Of joy ideal waste thyself! awake, and soar aloft!
Unfurl this hour those falcon wings which thou dost fold too long;
Raise to the skies thy lightning gaze, and sing thy loftiest song.
</p><p>Here, as in nearly all the compositions of Mrs. Osgood, the
<lb/>rhythm is singularly good, without art,—sonorous, well-balanced
<lb/>and well-modulated. The “'aspirations”—or more properly,
<lb/>perhaps, the bitter and unavailing regrets—have in them a touch-
<lb break="no"/>ing—a despairing sadness which makes us shudder as we read.</p><p></p><p>Neither of the poems just quoted, however, conveys much of
<lb/>the ordinary manner of the poetess. This is far better exem-
<lb break="no"/>plified in</p><p>LENORE.
Oh! fragile and fair, as the delicate chalices,
Wrought with so rare and so subtle a skill;
Bright relics, that tell of the pomp of those palaces,
Venice—the sea-goddess—glories in still.
Whose exquisite texture, transparent and tender,
A pure blush alone from the ruby wine takes;
Yet ah! if some false hand, profaning its splendor,
Dares but to taint it with poison,—it breaks!
So when Love pour’d thro’ thy pure heart his lightning,
On thy pale cheek the soft rose-hues awoke,—
So when wild Passion, that timid heart frightening,
Poison’d the treasure—it trembled and broke!
</p><p>Here we have a full representation of the author’s customary
<lb/>turn of thought—of her grace of expression—of her facility in
<lb/>illustration—of her exactitude—and of her epigrammatism. The
<lb/>versification (except in the first quatrain) is not as good as usual.
<lb/>The first two lines of the third are even rough. The rhythm is
<lb/>anapoestic—but the anapoestic all false and inadmissible—e g.</p><p>So when Love | poured through thy | pure heart' his | lightning,
On thy pale | cheek the soft | rose hues a | woke.
</p><p>Here the necessarily long syllables love, through, heart,pale,soft
<lb/>and hues, should be short, and the rhythm halts because they are
<lb/>not so. There is, also, either a syllable too much or a syllable
<lb/>too little at “lightning”—but these are trivialities of which it is,
<lb/>perhaps, hypercritical to speak.</p><p>We conclude this imperfect notice by the citation of what we
consider as, upon the whole, the finest poem in the collection.
A SONG.
Yes! “lower to the level”
Of those who laud thee now!
Go! join the joyous revel,
And pledge the heartless vow!
Go! dim the soul-born beauty
That lights that lofty brow!
Fill, fill the bowl! let burning wine
Drown, in thy soul, Love’s dream divine!
Yet when the laugh is lightest,
When wildest goes the jest,
When gleams the goblet brightest,
And proudest heaves thy breast,
And thou art madly pledging
Each gay and jovial guest,—
A ghost shall glide amid the flowers—
The shade of Love’s departed hours!
<pb n="355"/>
And thou shalt drink in sadness
From all the splendor there,
And curse the revel’s gladness,
And hate the banquet’s glare,
And pine 'mid Passion's madness,
For true Love’s purer air,
And feel thou’dst give their wildest glee
For one unsullied smile from me!
Yet deem not this my prayer, love,
Ah, no! if I could keep
Thy alter’d heart from care, love,
And charm its griefs to sleep,
Mine only should despair love,
I—I alone would weep!
I—I alone would mourn the flowers
That fade in Love’s deserted bowers!
</p><p>There is here a terse, concentrated and sustained energy which
<lb/>impresses us with a high opinion of the power of the poetess, and
<lb/>which warrants us in saying that she could do better—very far
<lb/>better than she has hitherto done. The poem would be improved,
<lb/>however, (as would all poems) by the substitution throughout of
<lb/>“you” for “thee” and so forth—the modern and colloquial for
<lb/>the ancient and so called poetical pronoun.</p><p></p><p>The limits of our paper warn us to bring these comments to a
<lb/>close. We shall resume this subject—to us a truly delightful
<lb/>one—at some future opportunity, in the more ample pages of

<lb/>Brothers.</p><p></p><p>This is a large and valuable octavo of 464 pages. We have
<lb/>given the title in full as the most succinct mode of conveying the
<lb/>nature and purpose of the work—one which no scholar can
<lb/>afford to do without, and which needs no recommendation from us
<lb/>to those engaged in manufacturing pursuits.</p><p></p><p>This able work supplies, in fact, a desideratum whose need has
<lb/>been long felt. No methodical treatise on Fibrous Substances
<lb/>has hitherto existed—and even the topic itself has very remarka-
<lb break="no"/>bly eluded the investigation of the learned. The Textrinum
<lb/>Antiquorum of Yates is almost the sole work devoted to the
<lb/>ancient history of the theme, and the nature of that treatise places
<lb/>it altogether out of popular reach.</p><p>We quote a paragraph from the Preface:
</p><p>That a topic of such interest deserved elucidation will not be
<lb/>denied when it is remembered that, apart from the question of the
<lb/>direct influence these important arts have ever exerted upon the
<lb/>civilization and social condition of communities, in various ages of
<lb/>the world, there are other and scarcely inferior considerations to the
<lb/>student, involved in their bearing upon the true understanding of
<lb/>history, sacred and profane. To supply, therefore, an important
<lb/>desideratum in classical archaeology, by thus seeking the better to
<lb/>illustrate the true social state of the ancients, thereby affording a
<lb/>commentary on their commerce and progress in domestic arts, is one
<lb/>of the leading objects contemplated by the present work. In addi-
<lb break="no"/>tion to this, our better acquaintance with the actual condition of
<lb/>these arts in early times, will tend, in many instances, to confirm
<lb/>the historic accuracy and elucidate the idiom of many portions of
<lb/>Holy Writ.</p><p>Among the engravings which illustrate the work, is one of
the Chinese Loom, a reduced fac-simile copied from a picture re-
</p><p>cently obtained from the Celestial Empire and now in the posses-
<lb break="no"/>sion of the N. Y. Presbyterian Board of Foreign Missions. There

Vol. 2. New York: Paine &amp; Burgess.
</p><p>This, the concluding volume of Mr. Lester’s entertaining book,
<lb/>has less unity of purpose, but greater variety of incident and
<lb/>anecdote, than the first. It is pervaded by a spirit of nationality
<lb/>which cannot be too highly commended—although the author
<lb/>errs in supposing that the objects for which he contends have
<lb/>not been urged upon the attention of the country in various
<lb/>quarters, with great zeal and uniformity, and for a long period of
<lb/>time. It is true, however, that the fruits of this exertion are only
<lb/>now making themselves apparent.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Lester has a heart for good and great things, as he proves
<lb/>by the warmth with which he addresses himself to the consider-
<lb break="no"/>ation of such men as Michael Angelo, Galileo, and Benjamin
<lb/>West. The paper on the Quaker painter is the most characteris-
<lb break="no"/>tic in the volume. That on British Berkeley, an early friend of
<lb/>America and a true prophet of her greatness, is equally marked
<lb/>and excellent.</p><p></p><p>This second volume is embellished by a well-executed steel
<lb/>engraving, the head of Americus Vespuccius. There are also

<lb/>than Byron. No single poem ever so powerfully affected us as
<lb/>“The Dying Hour,” included in No. 3 of this series. The effect,
<lb/>however, is in no respect a properly poetical one, and the same
<lb/>sentiments in prose would have produced an intenser passionate
<lb/>effect. We will endeavor to make ourselves more distinctly
<lb/>understood on this topic hereafter. Of course we admit the high
<lb/>powers of Mrs. Norton as a poetess—even in the most legitimate
<lb/>acceptation of the term.</p><p></p><p>The Life of Mozart, including his Correspondence. By Edward

<lb break="no"/>cellany,” and is a book of exceeding interest even to non-musical
<lb/>readers. To musicians it must have a much higher charm. The
<lb/>preface says:</p><p></p><p>The only biographical notice of Mozart in English is a translation
<lb/>from the French of Bombet (M. Beyle), itself a translation from the
<lb/>German of Schlictegroll—a sketch too short and scanty to satisfy
<lb/>the interest of the subject, although quite enough to pique public
<lb/>curiosity. With the exception of occasional fragments in maga-
<lb break="no"/>zines and reviews, little more is known in England of the life of
<lb/>the musician, its struggles, varied incidents, and influence upon art,
<lb/>or of the brilliant reputations that clustered round him. The object

Epigram.
FROM THE SPANISH.
To seek his wife, with little profit,
The Thracian Orpheus went to Tophet;
A realm of such a sad condition,
He could not seek on sadder mission:
Disposed to punish guest so human,
Grim Pluto gives him up the woman;
Yet, when the Bard’s songs overcome him,
Grows softened, and back takes her from him.
W. Gilmore Simms.
The Drama.
</p><p>Under this head we have exceedingly little to observe. Mrs.
<lb/>Mowatt has turned the heads of the Richmondians, who, with a
<lb/>j proper taste, appreciate her sweet tones, her excellent elocution,
<lb/>j and her peculiar grace and beauty. She is now in Charleston.</p><p>Miss Charlotte Barnes will appear at the Park probably
about the middle of this month.
Mr. Murdoch is everywhere successful.
</p><p>We were at the Park on Monday last, to see Mrs. Kean in
<lb/>‘‘Ion.” The play itself is one admirably adapted to the powers of
<lb/>the actress—assimilated in every respect to her genius—for
<lb/>genius she undoubtedly possesses—not the less great because
<lb/>subdued in tone.</p><p></p><p>“Ion” is no drama—if we think of what a drama should be.
<lb/>It never profoundly moves us. It stimulates rather the fancy
<lb/>than the passions. It is poetical, classical, “correct,” (in the
<lb/>French sense,) but no play—comparatively of course—it is better
<lb/>than ninety-nine plays out of a hundred.</p><p></p><p>Mrs. Kean evinces her genius chiefly in her exquisite intona-
<lb break="no"/>tion and gesture. No one, without genius, and that of a lofty order,
<lb/>could so thrill us by a mere tone. Her step is indeed the poetry
<lb/>of motion, and her limbs might put to the blush (if limbs or if
<lb/>marble could blush) those of the Venus of Cleomenes. Her figure,
<lb/>in other respects, is not particularly good—and the scarf of Ion
<lb/>gives an unpleasant roundness to the shoulders.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Kean’s acting impressed us more favorably than we had
<lb/>been led to anticipate. There were one or two points at which
<lb/>his reading (not his readings) produced an evident thrill of emo-
<lb break="no"/>tion throughout the audience. The dresses of Adrastus are
<lb/>excessively unbecoming.</p><p>We shall see “Ion” again and speak of it less at random.
</p><p>At Palmo’s, on Thursday last, a company of fashionable
<lb/>amateurs made an attempt at “Hamlet.” We shall give an
<lb/>account of the performance in our next.</p><p>The German Opera promises well.
</p><p>The Olympic, the Bowery, the Chatham, and the Richmond
<lb/>Hill theatres have all, we learn, been well attended of late, but
<lb/>we have been prevented, by an unusual press of business, from
<lb/>visiting either. It is our purpose to speak somewhat at large,
<lb/>hereafter, of theatrical matters.</p><p><pb n="357"/>
Sleep On.
Sleep on—for the starlight above thee is gleaming,
While love’s eye keeps watch o’er the couch of thy rest:
Sleep on—thy repose will be calmed by its beaming—
’Twill picture in thine, love, the dreams it loves best.
Sleep on—for the night-flowers around us are shaking
Their sweet incense cup to the zephyrs they love;
And the lone nightingale with music is waking
The echo of flower-crowned mountain and grove.
Sleep on—for the bright water-spirit is murm’ring
Her soft lullaby to the starry-gemm’d night,
That now on her pure, silent bosom is slumb’ring,
Gilding each dream-wave with crescents of light.
Sleep on—for the moonlight, though sweet, is as fleeting
As the soft, gentle rays that affection may shed—
Sleep on—e’er the Day-God again gives his greeting,
And night on her dark wing hath tremblingly fled.

The Fine Arts
</p><p>Miss Northall, on Wednesday evening, the 3d, had not
<lb/>as large an audience as we expected; owing, perhaps, to the in-
<lb break="no"/>clemency of the weather. It was, however, one of the best con-
<lb break="no"/>certs of the season. Miss Northall sang beautifully; better than
<lb/>on any other occasion. Mrs. Loder sustained her well-earned
<lb/>reputation, and Signor De Begnis sang as if he grew younger
<lb/>every day. Messrs. Kyle, Timm, and Marks did their parts
<lb/>well; the latter even better than we expected, and on the whole,
<lb/>we never were more pleased. We hope Miss Northall will soon
<lb/>favor us with a repetition of this concert.</p><p>We have received the following pieces:
Night and Morning, Valse characteristique.
Diane, Rondeau de Chasse.
Souvenir de Belville, Valse.
L'Hortense, Galope brillante.
L'Amitié, Variations Brillantes.
Bellone, Polonaise à la Militaire.
United States' Grand Waltz.
La Liberté, Variations brillantes.
All of them composed by Charles Grobe.
</p><p>There is a freshness and originality in the compositions of this
<lb/>gentleman, which is not often found in pieces of the same de-
<lb break="no"/>scription. We like his idea of expressing night and morning by
<lb/>minor and major, though we think the motives of the two waltzes
<lb/>should have been a little more different. The United Slates’ Grand
<lb/>Waltz is really a gem, and L'Amitié, a set of variations on a theme
<lb/>of La fille du Régiment, is as pleasing as it is easy and brilliant.</p><p>Another Pianist has lately arrived from France, and intends
giving a series of concerts in this city.
</p><p>A Complimentary Concert has been tendered to Mr. Paterson,
<lb/>the Editor of the Anglo-American, in which all the principal
<lb/>talent of this city will appear.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Christian Huber’s Concert.—A very select audience
<lb/>greeted this eminent artist on his appearance, and cheers and bra-
<lb break="no"/>vos were the reward of his masterly execution of the most difficult
<lb/>compositions on the Violoncello. But it seems that Mr. Huber
<lb/>has not been fortunate in the selection of his pieces, and that his
<lb/>assistants have been less so in the selection of theirs. The form-
<lb break="no"/>er gave us too little of the cantabile and portamente, while the</p><p></p><p>latter gave us altogether too much of it. We must except Mr.
<lb/>Gibert, for he sang the Serenade from Don Pasquale and the Ro-
<lb break="no"/>mance “Le Bon Curé,” with admirable grace.</p><p>Mr. Templeton had a crowded house at his farewell concert.
The Deathless Smile.
I saw one in her maidenhood,
From whom the life had fled;
And yet so lovely was her face,
It seemed she was not dead!
Her eyelids as in sleep were closed—
Her brow was white as snow;
A smile still lingered on her lips,
As if ’twere loth to go.
And it may be a smile so sweet—
So quiet and serene—
Was never on the healthy brow
Of living maiden seen.
Perchance the wondrous bliss which burst
Upon her raptured mind,
When first she woke in glory’s courts—
Now left its trace behind.
Her end was peace. I thought that they
Who loved her should not grieve,
For these last words they heard her say—
“My spirit, Lord! receive.”
And when they laid her in the earth,
Her cheek still held the bloom;
That smile, so sweet, the gentle maid
Bore with her to the tomb!
Would it be strange if brighter tints
Upon the blossoms crept,
Which grew above the sacred spot
Where that meek maiden slept.

The Raven and other Poems. By Edgar A. Poe. New York 
and London: Wiley and Putnam, 161 Broadway; 6 Waterloo
Place, pp. 91.
</p><p>Mr. Poe has earned some fame by various tales and poems, which 
<lb/>of late has become notoriety through a certain blackguard warfare 
<lb/>which he has been waging against the poets and newspaper critics
<lb/>of New England, and which it would be most charitable to impute
<lb/>to insanity. Judging from the tone of his late articles in the Broad-
<lb break="no"/>way Journal, he seems to think that the whole literary South and
<lb/>West are doing anxious battle in his person against the old time-
<lb break="no"/>honored tyrant of the North. But what have North or South to do
<lb/>with affairs only apropos to Poe? He shows himself a poet in
<lb/>this, at least, in the magnifying mirror of his own importance. To
<lb/>him facts lose their barren literality—to him a primrose is more
<lb/>than a primrose; and Edgar Poe, acting the constabulary part of a
<lb/>spy in detecting plagiarisms in favorite authors, insulting a Boston
<lb/>audience, inditing coarse editorials against respectable editresses,
<lb/>and getting singed himself the meanwhile, is "nothing less than the
<lb/>hero of a grand mystic conflict of the elements.</p><p></p><p>The present volume is not entirely pure of this controversy, else
<lb/>we should ignore the late scandalous courses of the man, and speak
<lb/>only of the “Poems.” The motive of the publication is too ap-
<lb break="no"/>parent; it contains the famous Boston poem, together with other
<lb/>juvenilities, which, he says, “private reasons—some of which have
<lb/>reference to the sin of plagiarism, and others to the date of Tenny-
<lb break="no"/>son’s first poems”—have induced him to republish. Does he mean
<lb/>to intimate that he is suspected of copying Tennyson? In vain have
<lb/>we searched the poems for a shadow of resemblance. Does he think
<lb/>to convict Tennyson of copying him? Another of those self-ex-
<lb break="no"/>aggerations which prove, we suppose, his poetic imagination.</p><p></p><p>In a sober attempt to get at the meaning and worth of these poems
<lb/>as poetry, we have been not a little puzzled. We must confess they
<lb/>have a great deal of power, a great deal of beauty, (of thought fre-
<lb break="no"/>quently, and always of rhythm and diction,) originality, and dra-
<lb break="no"/>matic effect. But they have more of effect than of expression; to
<lb/>adopt a distinction from musical criticism; and if they attract you
<lb/>to a certain length, it is only to repulse you the more coldly at last.
<lb/>There is a wild unearthliness, and unheavenliness, in the tone of all
<lb/>his pictures, a strange unreality in all his thoughts; they seem to
<lb/>stand shivering, begging admission to our hearts in vain, because
<lb/>they look not as if they came from the heart. The ill-boding
<lb/>“Raven,” which you meet at the threshold of his edifice, is a fit
<lb/>warning of the hospitality you will find inside. And yet the
<lb/>“Raven” has great beauty, and has won the author some renown; we
<lb/>were fascinated till we read it through; then we hated to look at it, or
<lb/>think of it again: why was that? There is something in it of the
<lb/>true grief of a lover, an imagination of a broken-heartedness enough
<lb/>to prove a lover in earnest, a power of strange, sad melody, which
<lb/>there is no resisting. So there is in all his poems. Mr. Poe has made
<lb/>a critical study of the matter of versification, and succeeded in the art
<lb/>rather at the expense of nature. Indeed the impression of a very
<lb/>studied effect is always uppermost after reading him. And you have
<lb/>to study him to understand him. This you would count no loss, if,
<lb/>when you had followed the man through his studies, you could find
<lb/>anything in them beyond the man and his most motiveless moods,
<lb/>which lead you nowhere; if you could find anything better at bottom
<lb/>than the pride of originality. What is the fancy which is merely
<lb/>fancy, the beauty which springs from no feeling, which neither il-
<lb break="no"/>lustrates nor promotes the great rules and purposes of life, which
<lb/>glimmers strangely only because it is aside from the path of human
<lb/>destiny? Edgar Poe does not write for Humanity; he has more of
<lb/>the art than the soul of poetry. He affects to despise the world
<lb/>while he writes for it. He certainly has struck out a remarkable
<lb/>course: the style and imagery of his earliest poems mark a very
<lb/>singular culture, a judgment most severe for a young writer, and a
<lb/>familiarity with the less hacknied portions of classic lore and no-</p><p></p><p>menclature. He seems to have had an idea of working out his forms
<lb/>from pure white marble. But the poet’s humility is wanting; a
<lb/>morbid egotism repels you. He can affect you with wonder, but
<lb/>rarely with the thrill of any passion, except perhaps of pride, which
<lb/>might be dignity, and which therefore always is interesting. We
<lb/>fear this writer even courts the state described by Tennyson:</p><p>A glorious devil, large in heart and brain,
That did love beauty only, (beauty seen
In all varieties of mould and mind,)
And knowledge for its beauty; or if good,
Good only for its beauty, seeing not
That Beauty, Good, and Knowledge, are three sisters
That doat upon each other, friends to man,
Living together under the same roof,
And never can be sundered without tears;
</p><p>And he that shuts Love out, in turn shall be
<lb/>Shut out by Love, and on her threshold lie
<lb/>Howling in utter darkness.</p><p></p><p>There is something in all this which we really respect—an ev-
<lb break="no"/>ident wish to be sincere, pervading the whole tone of the sermon
<lb/>—an anxious determination to speak the truth—at least as far as
<lb/>convenient. The Brook Farm Phalanx talks to us, in short,
<lb/>“like a Dutch uncle,” and we shall reply to it, very succinctly,
<lb/>in the same spirit.</p><p></p><p>“Very charitable to impute to insanity.” Insanity is a word
<lb/>that the Brook Farm Phalanx should never be brought to men-
<lb break="no"/>tion under any circumstances whatsoever. “No more of that,
<lb/>Hal, an ye love me.”</p><p></p><p>“The time-honored tyrant of the North.” Very properly
<lb/>rugavvos—not Batiasus. King Log at best. The sceptre is de-
<lb break="no"/>parted.</p><p>“Insulting a Boston audience”—very true—meant to do it—
and did.
</p><p>“Getting singed in return.” The singeing refers, we presume,
<lb/>to the doubling,in five weeks,the circulation of the “Broadway
<lb/>Journal.”</p><p></p><p>“Motive of the publication too apparent.” “The Raven, etc.,”
<lb/>was in the publishers’ hands a month or six weeks before we re-
<lb break="no"/>ceived the invitation from the Lyceum—and we read the last
<lb/>proofs on the evening before that on which we “insulted the
<lb/>Boston audience.” On these points The Brook Farm Phalanx are
<lb/>referred to Messrs. Wiley and Putnam.</p><p></p><p>“Discover no shade of resemblance to Tennyson.” Certainly
<lb/>not—we never could discover any ourselves. Our foot-note
<lb/>(quoted by the Phalanx) has reference to an article written by Mr.
<lb/>Charles Dickens in the London Foreign Quarterly Review. Mr.
<lb/>Dickens in paying us some valued, though injudicious compli-
<lb break="no"/>ments, concluded by observing, that “we had all Tennyson’s
<lb/>spirituality, and might be considered as the best of his imitators”
<lb/>—words to that effect. Our design has been merely to demon-
<lb break="no"/>strate (should a similar accusation again be made) that the poems
<lb/>in question were published before Tennyson had written at all.</p><p></p><p>“Has acquired some renown by the Raven.” We cannot ap-
<lb break="no"/>prove of the “same”—especially in the mouths of those worship-
<lb break="no"/>pers of Truth, The Brook Farm Phalanx.</p><p></p><p>The Brook Farm Phalanx knows very well—and so do we—
<lb/>that no American poem gained for its author even one half so
<lb/>much “renown” in the same period of time. The renown is
<lb/>quite as small a thing as the poem—and we have therefore no
<lb/>scruple in alluding to it—although we do so only because it
<lb/>shocks us to hear a set of respectable Crazyites talking in so dis-
<lb break="no"/>ingenuous a manner. Reform it altogether, or give up preaching
<lb/>about Truth.</p><p></p><p>As for the rest, we believe it is all leather and prunella—the
<lb/>opinion of “The Snook Farm Phalanx.” We do trust that, in
<lb/>future, “The Snook Farm Phalanx” will never have any opinion
<lb/>of us at all.</p><p><pb n="359"/>
</p><p>The most eminent living writer of Portugal, indeed the only
<lb/>one of any considerable eminence, is Senhor Almeida Garrett, a
<lb/>leading deputy of the ultra-liberal opposition in Lisbon, who has
<lb/>very high powers both as an orator and a poet; though his poet-
<lb break="no"/>ical works appear rather deficient in strength of original thought.
<lb/>His prose is both brilliant and powerful. His poems are of con-
<lb break="no"/>siderable extent, and not the least of their charms is that he is a
<lb/>good scholar and eminent for antiquarian research. He is of the
<lb/>blank-verse school, which in Portugal is a great misfortune.
<lb/>We extract the following as a favorable specimen, and the more
<lb/>willingly because it unfolds the beauties of a word, “Saudade,”
<lb/>upon the exclusive possession of which the Portuguese particular-
<lb break="no"/>ly pride themselves. There is certainly no one word in any other
<lb/>European language which conveys the same idea. It expresses
<lb/>the sweet yet painful sensation created by the contemplation of a
<lb/>beloved object from which we are separated:—</p><p></p><p>Oh tender yearning! bitterness of joy
<lb/>For the unhappy, thorn of absence with
<lb/>Delicious puncture piercing through the heart,</p><p>Awakening pain that lacerates the soul.
Yet hath it pleasure;―tender yearning grief!
Mysterious power that canst awaken hearts,
And make them ooze forth, drop by drop distilled,
Not life-blood, but of soft and dewy tears
A solacing abundance;—yearning grief;
</p><p>Beloved name, that sounds so honey-sweet
<lb/>In lips of Lucitania; sound unknown
<lb/>To the proud mouths of these Sycambrians
<lb/>Of foreign lands;—oh, tender yearning grief!</p><p>Thou magic Power that dost transport the soul
Of absence unto solitary friend,
Of wandering lover to his mistress lorn,
</p><p>And even the sad and wretched exile, most
<lb/>Unhappy of Earth’s children, bear'st in dreams
<lb/>Back to his country’s bosom, dreams so sweet
<lb/>That cruel’tis the dreamer to awake.</p><p>If, on thy humid altar, tear-bedewed,
</p><p>I laid my heart, which fast was throbbing still
<lb/>When from my bleeding breast I plucked it forth
<lb/>At Tagus’ mouth beloved;—come in thy car,</p><p>By gently murmuring doves gray-pinioned drawn,
And seek my heart which, Goddess, sighs for thee!
</p><p>Mr. Hudson, on Tuesday evening last, read to an audience of
<lb/>some two hundred persons, at the Society Library, his Lecture on
<lb/>Lear (or a portion of it) recently delivered at Boston, and much
<lb/>complimented in one or two of the Boston papers. We listened
<lb/>to the lecturer with profound attention, and (for the first time)
<lb/>heard him throughout. He did not favorably impress us. His
<lb/>good points are a happy talent for fanciful, that is to say for un-
<lb break="no"/>expected (too often far-fetched) illustration, and a certain cloudy
<lb/>acuteness in respect to motives of human action. His bad points
<lb/>are legion—want of concentration—want of consecutiveness—
<lb/>want of definite purpose—want of common school education—
<lb/>utter incapacity to comprehend a drama out of its range of mere
<lb/>character—an absurd passion for the lower species, that is to say,
<lb/>for the too obvious species of antithesis—a more absurd rage for
<lb/>metaphor and direct simile, without the least ability to keep them
<lb/>within bounds, or to render them consistent, either per se, or with
<lb/>the matter into which they are introduced—to crown all, a pitiable
<lb/>affectation of humility altogether unbecoming a man, an elocution
<lb/>that would disgrace a pig, and an odd species of gesticulation
<lb/>of which a baboon would have excellent reason to be ashamed.</p><p></p><p>The Tribune says;―"The article in the American Review of
<lb/>this month, entitled  'The Facts of M. Valdemar's Case, by Edgar
<lb/>A. Poe,’ is of course a romance—who could have supposed it
<lb/>otherwise? Those who have read Mr. Poe’s visit to the Mael-
<lb break="no"/>strom, South Pole, &amp;c., have not been puzzled by it, yet we learn
<lb/>that several good matter-of-fact citizens have been, sorely. It is
<lb/>a pretty good specimen of Poe’s style of giving an air of reality
<lb/>to fictions, and we utterly condemn the choice of a subject, but
<lb/>whoever thought it a veracious recital must have the bump of
<lb/>Faith large, very large indeed.”</p><p></p><p>For our parts we find it difficult to understand how any dis-
<lb break="no"/>passionate transcendentalist can doubt the facts as we state them;
<lb/>they are by no means so incredible as the marvels which are
<lb/>hourly narrated, and believed, on the topic of Mesmerism. Why
<lb/>cannot a man’s death be postponed indefinitely by Mesmerism?
<lb/>Why cannot a man talk after he is dead? Why?—why?—that
<lb/>is the question; and as soon as the Tribune has answered it to
<lb/>our satisfaction we will talk to it farther.</p><p></p><p>Hon. Wm. C. Preston has been elected President of the South
<lb/>Carolina College at Columbia. It is understood that he will accept
<lb/>and commence the duties of the Presidency early in the ensuing
<lb/>year. In the meantime, Rev. Dr. Hooper will discharge them.
<lb/>Rev. Dr. Henry has been offered the Greek Professorship, and we
<lb/>sincerely hope that he may accept it. The accession of Mr.
<lb/>Preston is of course, per se, and without reference to the secession
<lb/>of Dr. Henry, a subject of congratulation to the College—hut
<lb/>upon the whole, some injustice, we think, has been done to the
<lb/>late President. We shall speak more fully in our next.</p><p>The Mirror says:
</p><p>The editor of the Philadelphia North American has “scared up”
<lb/>a feminine genius—a poetical wonder—hear him: “The greatest
<lb/>poet of her sex who ever lived, is Maria Brooks. She is as much
<lb/>above Mrs. Hemans, Miss Landon, Mrs. Norton, et id omne genus,
<lb/>as they are above the sickliest sentimentalists of the chambermaids’
<lb/>gazettes!!</p><p></p><p>There is, perhaps, some exaggeration in the North American’s
<lb/>estimate of Mrs. Brooks, but far more in the Mirror’s attempt at
<lb/>depreciation. Mrs. Maria Brooks, author of “Zophiel, or The
<lb/>Bride of Seven,” is fairly entitled to be culled the greatest of
<lb/>American poetesses. Her imagination and audacity of thought
<lb/>and expression, are not far behind Miss Barrett. Her chief faults
<lb/>are bombast and extravagance.</p><p></p><p>Connoisseurs and amateurs of Tea would do well to look over
<lb/>the Catalogue of Teas on sale at the warehouse of the Pekin Tea
<lb/>Company, No. 75 Fulton street. See advertisement in this
<lb/>week’s Journal. Hitherto it has been impossible to procure
<lb/>really good green tea at less than a dollar per pound. The Pekin
<lb/>Company afford an exquisite article at 75 cents—other teas at
<lb/>proportionate rates. We can conscientiously recommend them.</p><p>A late "Tribune” has a very just review of Longfellow. We
quote a few passages:—
</p><p>The portrait which adorns this volume is not merely flattered or
<lb/>idealized, but there is an attempt at adorning it, by expression
<lb/>thrown into the eyes, with just that which the original does not
<lb/>possess, whether in face or mind. We have often seen faces whose
<lb/>usually coarse and heavy lineaments were harmonized at times into
<lb/>beauty by the light that rises from the soul into the eyes. The in-
<lb break="no"/>tention Nature had with regard to the face and its wearer, usually
<lb/>eclipsed beneath bad habits or a bad education, is then disclosed and
<lb/>we see what hopes Death has in stove for that soul. But here the</p><p><pb n="360"/>
</p><p>enthusiasm thrown into the eyes only makes the rest of the face
<lb/>look more weak, and the idea suggested is the anomalous one of a
<lb/>Dandy Pindar.</p><p></p><p>Such is not the case with Mr. Longfellow himself. He is never
<lb/>a Pindar, though he is sometimes a Dandy even in the clear and or-
<lb break="no"/>namented streets and trim gardens of his verse But he is still more
<lb/>a man of cultivated taste, delicate though not deep feeling, and some,
<lb/>though not much, poetic force.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Longfellow has been accused of plagiarism. We have been
<lb/>surprised that any one should have been anxious to fasten special
<lb/>charges of this kind upon him, when we had supposed it so obvious
<lb/>that the greater part of his mental stores were derived from the
<lb/>works of others. He has no style of his own growing out of his own
<lb/>experiences and observations of nature. Nature with him, whether
<lb/>human or external, is always seen through the windows of literature.
<lb/>There are in his poems sweet and tender passages descriptive of his
<lb/>personal feelings, but very few showing him as an observer, at first
<lb/>hand, of the passions within, or the landscape without.</p><p></p><p>This want of the free breath of nature, this perpetual borrowing of
<lb/>imagery, this excessive, because superficial, culture which he has
<lb/>derived from an acquaintance with the elegant literature of many
<lb/>nations and men, out of proportion to the experience of life within
<lb/>himself, prevent Mr. Longfellow’s verses from ever being a true re-
<lb break="no"/>freshment to ourselves. He says in one of his most graceful verses:
<lb/>From the cool cistern of the midnight air

<lb/>80 pages, octavo, printed on handsome white paper, with bold, clear
<lb/>type, at Five Dollars per annum, payable in advance.</p><p></p><p>The aim of the editor has been to establish a Journal of Art and
<lb/>Letters, whose papers should be distinguished for force, vigor, sar-
<lb break="no"/>casm and pith, rather than an unutterable and bathetic profundity;
<lb/>one, which should not fear to expose literary quackery, and give to
<lb/>writers a proper precedence; one that had the moral courage to
<lb/>praise an enemy’s good works, and censure a friend’s bad ones; one
<lb/>that would maintain a rigorous independence on literary, political
<lb/>and religious matters; one that would attack all abuses without
<lb/>scruple; one that was insensible to fear, and deaf to favor; and one
<lb/>that depended for success on the merit of its papers, and not on the
<lb/>names announced as contributors. If the editor may judge from the
<lb/>high panegyric of the press, and the more substantial evidence of an
<lb/>increasing subscription list, he has succeeded in his intention.</p><p></p><p>Those desiring to sustain an independent and fearless magazine

NARRATIVE OF A MISSION TO BOKHARA,
In the year 1843-45, to ascertain the fate of Col. Stoddart and
Capt. Conolly.
By the Rev. Joseph Wolff, LL.D.
</p><p>“This work has created a prodigious excitement throughout
<lb/>England; it is unique in its character, as a literary production. It
<lb/>seems to partake of the features of an autobiography; the narrative
<lb/>being full of personal detail, description of the perilous adventure
<lb/>and imminent hazard of the author, in his expedition through the
<lb/>East. No man living, perhaps, has traveled so extensively as this
<lb/>celebrated individual, and few could have contributed a more in-
<lb break="no"/>tensely interesting narrative of his experience.</p><p></p><p>“It will thus be seen that this extraordinary and eccentric man
<lb/>is admirably qualified to present a transcript of Asiatic Character-
<lb break="no"/>istics,—supplying much that is novel and exceedingly curious about
<lb/>tribes and nations of which we know so little. To say that the
<lb/>work is an acceptable addition to the library of travel, is affirming
<lb/>far too little of so striking a production: it is a book that ought to
<lb/>be read and deliberately enjoyed by every intelligent person, for its
<lb/>quaintness, freshness, and superabounding interest. The work is
<lb/>elegantly printed as a library book, and adorned by some dozen curi-

DENTISTRY.
</p><p>DOCT. H. E. SCHOONMAKER, Dental Surgeon, Office, 446
<lb/>Houston st., two doors from Broadway—opposite St. Thomas’
<lb/>Church.</p><p></p><p>Doct. S.’s experience and skill in his profession give him confi-
<lb break="no"/>dence in asserting that his operations are unsurpassed by any Den-
<lb break="no"/>tist in this city. Dr. S.’s manner of inserting artificial teeth varies
<lb/>in many essential points from the usual mode; and his success in
<lb/>pleasing all, he is happy to say, has brought him many difficult
<lb/>cases, which had been unsuccessfully treated by Dentists of estab-
<lb break="no"/>lished professional reputation, and whose prices for the same opera-
<lb break="no"/>tion were double his own. The object in inserting artificial teeth
<lb/>is to supply the deficiency occasioned by the loss of natural teeth,
<lb/>both in regard to utility, comfort in wearing, and natural appear-
<lb break="no"/>ance. In all these points, Dr. S.’s manner is pre-eminent. His
<lb/>mechanical tact and ingenuity have enabled him to surmount many
<lb/>obstacles, which have long, with the profession generally, impeded
<lb/>the path to success in every operation. He makes use of the best
<lb/>materials in all his operations—and in cases where the gum has
<lb/>fallen away by absorption, (which is always the case, more or less,
<lb/>when teeth have been extracted,) which causes a contraction of the
<lb/>lips and cheeks, the disfigurement of which cannot be fully obviated
<lb/>without adopting the artificial gums, which will supply the de-
<lb break="no"/>ficiency, and give to the mouth its usual redundancy—besides, their
<lb/>beauty and natural appearance render detection impossible.</p><p>Dr. S. would be happy to refer those who require it, to many of
the best families in this City, in which he has practised.
Ladies who desire it, can have their teeth examined at their resi-
dences, by sending their address as above.	nov8—9t

</p><p>* Caution.—Large quantities of Hyson Skin are retailed in this
<lb/>market as being a Hyson Tea. It is well worth while to compare
<lb/>the Hyson Tea usually sold at 75 cents with the genuine article
<lb/>that the company offer at the same price. The difference is so per-
<lb break="no"/>ceptible, on trial, as to render any further comment unnecessary.</p><p></p><p>Monstrous Fraud—Gunpowder and Imperial Teas cannot be
<lb/>retailed by small dealers, in this country, at 75 cents per pound,
<lb/>because they frequently cost that money in China, and no Importer
<lb/>in this city can sell good Gunpowder or Imperial Tea at a less price
<lb/>than 75 cents per pound by the hundred packages. T. F. Davies,
<lb/>Esq., in his interesting work on China, details the manner in
<lb/>which he saw the lowest grades of Black Teas manufactured and
<lb/>colored with Prussian Blue, so as to closely imitate Gunpowder and
<lb/>Imperial Teas, and adds, the Prussian Blue being a combination of
<lb/>Prussic Acid with Iron, is of course a dangerous poison. Let pur-
<lb break="no"/>chasers therefore beware of adulterated teas, and deal with those
<lb/>venders whose characters and resources raise them above suspicion.
<lb/>Beware of the Gunpowder and Imperial Teas retailed at 75 cents
<lb/>per pound, and compare them with the genuine article sold by the
<lb/>Pekin Tea Company. No one, it is presumed, wishes to drink
<lb/>poison. The company have published a book,giving full details on
<lb/>this subject, which may be had at their warehouse, 75 Fulton street,
<lb/>free of charge.</p><p>Recommendations.
</p><p>We drink Green Tea, and for many years have been paying one
<lb/>dollar per pound for it. But thanks to the Pekin Tea Company, we
<lb/>now get a better tea from them at 75 cents per pound. We drink one
<lb/>pound per week, by which we are now saving thirteen dollars per year,
<lb/>and enjoying better tea in the bargain. Commend us to the Pekin Tea
<lb/>Company, say we.—[Mirror.</p><p></p><p>The Pekin Tea Company, 75 Fulton street, are performing a great
<lb/>and good work, and will, in a few years, beyond all doubt, drive all the
<lb/>poor teas which have deluged this country, and defrauded consumers
<lb/>of the article, out of the market. They import none but pure and fra-</p><p></p><p>grant teas, and retail them by the single pound at wholesale prices.
<lb/>Families are always sure of obtaining good teas at this great tea ware-
<lb break="no"/>     house, in quantities to suit their convenience, and at the same price
<lb/>that the merchant pays who buys to sell again.—[Daily True Sun.</p><p></p><p>You may be sure of obtaining at all times, pure and highly flavored
<lb/>    teas, by the single pound, at wholesale prices, of the Pekin Tea Com-
<lb break="no"/>pany, 75 Fulton street. They have probably the largest stock, and
<lb/>greatest variety of green and black teas, of any one establishment in
<lb/>    the United States. They are doing a large business, and a great benefit
<lb/>    to consumers of tea.—[Atlas.</p><p></p><p>Heretofore it has been very difficult, indeed impossible, to always
<lb/>    obtain good green and black teas; but now you have only to visit the
<lb/>ware-rooms of the Pekin Tea Company, 75 Fulton street,’to obtain as
<lb/>delicious and fragrant teas as you could wish for.—Daily Sun.</p><p>If any of our readers desire to have good tea, they can obtain it of
the Pekin Tea Company, 75 Fulton street.—[Mercury.
</p><p>A Word to Tea Drinkers.—The Pekin Tea Company, 75 Fulton
<lb/>street, have imported into this market some five hundred thousand dol-
<lb break="no"/>lars worth of the finest grade of green and black teas, grown in the
<lb/>Celestial Empire, done up in all the various fancy packages that Chi-
<lb break="no"/>nese ingenuity can invent. It is a privilege to buy teas at this great
<lb/>establishment, and a luxury and comfort to drink them. They sell
<lb/>good teas only, and retail them at wholesale prices. Country merchants
<lb/>who wish to always sell good teas can always obtain them at this place,
<lb/>on reasonable terms.—[Emporium.</p><p></p><p>The Pekin Ten Company.—We very cheerfully call the attention
<lb/>of all lovers of pure and fragrant Teas, both in town and country, to the
<lb/>great tea warehouse of this company. Our long acquaintance with the
<lb/>proprietors enables us to bespeak for them the entire confidence of the
<lb/>public. We know that their teas, both in quality and price, are all that
<lb/>is stated of them. Many a lover of the fragrant herb has been com-
<lb break="no"/>pelled to eschew the drinking of tea in consequence of its injurious
<lb/>effects, until at length he has become hopeless of finding, among any of
<lb/>the imported varieties of tea in our market, a kind which had not such
<lb/>an effect. In this, however, such persons will be agreeably disappointed.
<lb/>The Pekin Tea Company nave commenced the importation of choice
<lb/>varieties of Garden Teas, of most delicious flavor—cultivated and
<lb/>picked with great care, which have heretofore never been introduced
<lb/>into this country, except as presents to importers. Among these they
<lb/>have an Oolong, mild as zephyr, and fragrant as a rose, which we es-
<lb break="no"/>pecially recommend to all nervous persons. Its effect upon many of
<lb/>those who have tried it, is to make them confirmed tea-drinkers. Ladies
<lb/>who have tried it say they never before drank such tea. But all tastes
<lb/>can here be suited, with the great advantage over other stores of getting
<lb/>a pure article at wholesale price, however small the quantity. The
<lb/>company’s warehouse is at 75 Fulton street.—[New World.</p><p></p><p>Tea.—The Pekin Tea Company, No. 75 Fulton street, unquestionably
<lb/>sell the best teas imported into this market. That they sell them
<lb/>cheaper than any other establishment, is a fact proven in a thousand
<lb/>instances since they have opened their store.</p><p></p><p>We would advise our friends to call at this place, and if they don’t
<lb/>wish to buy, at least to obtain a little pamphlet, kept on their counter,
<lb/>entitled “Hints to Tea-Driukers,” and therefrom learn a little useful
<lb/>information on the subject. The pamphlet is given gratis.—[Anglo-
<lb break="no"/>American.</p><p></p><p>The finest specimens of green and black teas ever sold in this
<lb/>country, are imported by the Pekin Tea Company, 75 Fulton street.
<lb/>Those who want good teas at reasonable prices, can always get them
<lb/>there.—[Tribune.</p><p></p><p>We have tried the teas imported by the Pekin Tea Company. 75
<lb/>Fulton street, and, if we live, will try them often. They are selling
<lb/>the most delicious teas we ever drank, and retail them at wholesale
