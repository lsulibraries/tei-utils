</p><p>Truth, whether in or out of fashion, is the measure of knowledge and the busi-

REVIEWS.
</p><p>The Sanitary Condition of the Laboring Population of New
<lb/>York. With suggestions for its improvement. A discourse (with
<lb/>additions) delivered on the 30th December, 1844, at the Repository
<lb/>of the American Institute. By John H. Griscom, M. D., Fellow
<lb/>of the College of Physicians and Surgeons; Physician of the New
<lb/>York Hospital; late Physician of the city and eastern dispensaries.
<lb/>New York; Harper &amp; Brothers, 82 Cliff street. 1845.</p><p></p><p>If any evidence were needed to prove the utter incapacity
<lb/>of the men into whose hands the government of this great
<lb/>city has fallen, to discharge the duties of their fearfully re-
<lb break="no"/>sponsible station, the following extract from the preface of
<lb/>this important pamphlet would furnish it.</p><p></p><p>“ The subject matter of the following pages was originally addres-
<lb break="no"/>sed, in the form of a letter, to the Chief Magistrate of the city. Its
<lb/>preparation was undertaken, principally with a view to an exposition
<lb/>of the true principles which should regulate the action of public bodies,
<lb/>in matters relating to the health of cities, in a knowledge of, or con-
<lb break="no"/>cern for, which, recent events had shown our own munic pal legislature
<lb/>to be somewhat deficient. Appreciating fully the importance of its
<lb/>facts and suggestions, the Mayor transmitted the communication to a
<lb/>co-ordinate branch of the City Government, recommending it to their
<lb/>serious attention. After several weeks’ deliberation upon it, the com-
<lb break="no"/>mittee to whom it was referred arrived at the conclusion, embodied
<lb/>in the following language quoted from their report: ‘Your committee do
<lb/>not profess to be judges of the subject, or in other words, they do
<lb/>not think it proper at this time, to go into such a measure,’ and they
<lb/>recommended that the paper be returned to its author.”</p><p></p><p>We do not intend to cast any peculiar blame on the Native
<lb/>American party, as the politicians are called who have the
<lb/>welfare of our citizens in their hands at present, because we
<lb/>believe that either of the other two parties who strove for the
<lb/>management of our municipal affairs would have acted in
<lb/>the same manner. In truth, our politicians have yet to learn
<lb/>their alphabet in the art of government; but the misfortune
<lb/>of it is, that their instructors, the people, are wofully defi-
<lb break="no"/>cient in this kind of knowledge themselves. The happiness
<lb/>of the people seems never to be thought of in municipal legis-
<lb break="no"/>latures. The exact objects aimed at by our Common Coun- 
<lb/>cil it would be difficult toascertain. The spending of a good 
<lb/>deal of money, and the best way of getting it from the peo-
<lb break="no"/>ple, seem to be the only definite notions of government that
<lb/>any of our boards of aldermen have had during the past
<lb/>twenty years. The present party in power regard the read-
<lb break="no"/>ing of some particular books in the district schools as the 
<lb/>great point to be settled by them ; and while the people are
<lb/>literally dying in consequence of inhaling the unhealthy mi-
<lb break="no"/>asma of filthy streets, the party that has the power to purge
<lb/>the atmosphere, and make the city a desirable residence,
<lb/>wastes all its energies in forcing a certain part of the children
<lb/>under their charge to take their first lessons in reading out of
<lb/>particular books which are repugnant to the feelings of their
<lb/>parents. It matters not a whit to a denizen of our streets
<lb/>what the city fathers have done or are doing, so long as the
<lb/>thoroughfares and byways are nearly impassable for filth.
<lb/>If it were an object to the citizens of this great metropolis, to
<lb/>tax themselves at the enormous rate which they were com-
<lb break="no"/>pelled to do for the sake of pure water, it is quite as much
<lb/>of an object to them to tax themselves for the sake of pure
<lb/>air ; and we have no doubt that taxation would be submitted</p><p></p><p>to as cheerfully in one case as in the other. Clean streets
<lb/>would keep many a family in New York that now is com-
<lb break="no"/>pelled to seek for a healthier home in Brooklyn, or Jersey
<lb/>City, or Staten Island. Gentlemen who have moved over
<lb/>upon Long Island, after living many years in the city,
<lb/>find that they make a very great saving in their doctor’s
<lb/>bills.</p><p></p><p>Dr. Griscom says; “ A highly respectable friend, a distin-
<lb break="no"/>guished advocate, informed me lately, that some of his chil-
<lb break="no"/>dren had not had a day’s illness during the two years they
<lb/>had been at school in the country, while the others, residing
<lb/>at home, though in a comparatively salubrious position in
<lb/>the city, cost him from twenty to thirty dollars each, for
<lb/>medicine and medical attendance.”</p><p></p><p>And yet in spite of this experience on the part of this dis-
<lb break="no"/>tinguished advocate, he will continue to reside in the city,
<lb/>when he might by a very trifling sacrifice live in the country,
<lb/>and preserve his own and his children’s health. We know
<lb/>several distinguished advocates whose families live ten or
<lb/>twelve miles from the City Hall, who contrive to be pretty
<lb/>constant in their attendance at the courts. There is very lit-
<lb break="no"/>tle more inconvenience, for a lawyer, in living on Staten
<lb/>Island, than in living in Chelsea or Union Square; while the
<lb/>increased vigor which they derive from daily crossing the
<lb/>water and breathing the pure air of the country, enables them
<lb/>to accomplish quite as much labor as the time lost in travel-
<lb break="no"/>ling to and from their office would do. It is an unaccounta-
<lb break="no"/>ble delusion that keeps men confined in the city when busi-
<lb break="no"/>ness will allow of a residence in the country. Setting aside
<lb/>all the enjoyments of a rural home, the cheapness of it should
<lb/>induce a prudent man to prefer it. A tolerably respectable
<lb/>house in town costs from four hundred to eight hundred dol-
<lb break="no"/>lars per annum. Within ten or twelve miles of the Battery,
<lb/>a comfortable country house with an orchard, garden, and
<lb/>so forth, may be had at from one to two hundred dollars ; an
<lb/>extra hundred dollars will cover all the expenses of travel,
<lb/>while the gain in health would be worth a sum which can-
<lb break="no"/>not be estimated in dollars and cents. Dr. Griscom very
<lb/>clearly proves that a city residence cannot be healthy, even
<lb/>in the most favorable situations; what it must be then, in
<lb/>the least favorable, the following appalling statement will
<lb/>snow.</p><p></p><p>"Almost every one can recall to mind, some proof of the effects of
<lb/>nauseous odors, of the inhalation of foul air, or of sleeping in a small
<lb/>confined apartment, upon his own health and feelings. These effects
<lb/>may have been only temporary, but they will serve to show that a pro-
<lb break="no"/>longed continuance of them, must, in reason, produce permanently bad
<lb/>results upon the mental and corporeal powers. If the inhaled air (one
<lb/>great source of the life, health, and vigor of the animal structure) is
<lb/>deteriorated in quality, or diminished in quantity, below the standards
<lb/>necessary for a perfect decarbonization of the blood in the lungs, the
<lb/>blood necessarily becomes burdened with impurities, and fails to impart
<lb/>to the system the qualities demanded by nature for the due mainten-
<lb break="no"/>ance of health and strength. Every city resident who takes a stroll
<lb/>into the country can testify to the difference between the two atmos-
<lb break="no"/>pheres of the two situations;—the contrast of our out-door (to say
<lb/>nothing of the in-door) atmosphere, loaded with the animal and veg-
<lb break="no"/>etable exhalations of our streets, yards, sinks, and cellars—and the air
<lb/>of the mountains, rivers, and grassy plains, needs no epicurean lungs
<lb/>to detect it. The superior corporeal activity, and the mental exhilara-
<lb break="no"/>tion imparted by it, are the prima facie proofs of its superiority. Com-
<lb break="no"/>pare the pale face of the city belle, or matron, after the long confine-
<lb break="no"/>ment of the winter and spring, with the same countenance in the fall,
<lb/>upon her return from a lew weeks’ tour to the Springs and Niagara,
<lb/>and observe whether the return of the long absent rose upon the cheek</p><p><pb n="114"/>
is not accompanied with a greater elasticity of frame, and a happier
and stronger tone of mind.
</p><p>“ Descend a few steps further, from the airy and well-lighted cham-
<lb break="no"/>ber and parlor, to the confined apartments of the pent-up court, and
<lb/>the damp, secluded cellar; draw a contrast between the gay inhabi-
<lb break="no"/>tant of the former, and the attenuated tenant of the latter, and we
<lb/>may then judge of the influences of the air which they respectively
<lb/>respire.</p><p></p><p>“ Observe, further, the vast difference in the development of frame,
<lb/>healthiness of countenance, and power of endurance, between the chil-
<lb break="no"/>dren of the farmer, and offspring of the city resident.</p><p>“ The following facts show, by figures, the sad condition in which
a very large number of our people may be said barely to exist.
</p><p>“ As a great part of the population of these places are destitute of
<lb/>the means of paying for medical assistance, the duty of ministering to
<lb/>them in hours of sickness, falls upon the Dispensary Physicians. I
<lb/>find, upon examining the records of their labors, the reports of the
<lb/>three medical charities for the year ending March, 1844, there were
<lb/>prescribed for at the offices, and the homes of the poor, at the
<lb/>Northern Dispensary,           13,317 Patients,</p><p>Eastern          “	17,107	“
New York      "	23,858	“
Total, 54,282
</p><p>From this number a deduction is to be made of those vaccinated, be-
<lb break="no"/>ing 4505. In visiting the sick poor at their homes, however, it hap-
<lb break="no"/>pens very frequently that some are prescribed for whose names are
<lb/>neglected to be entered, so that it is perfectly safe to estimate the
<lb/>number of sick persons who received aid from these charities, to be
<lb/>over 50,000 in one year. In the corresponding year there were admit-
<lb break="no"/>ted into the Alms House Hospital 2332 patients, and into the City
<lb/>Hospital about 1000, exclusive of seamen, making a total of over
<lb/>53,000, without enumerating the sick poor attended by private cha-
<lb break="no"/>rity.”</p><p>[To be continued.]
THE ART OF THE USE OF COLOR IN IMITATION IN PAINTING.
NO. II.
BY WILLIAM PAGE.
</p><p>There are, as we have before stated, only three primitive
<lb/>colors in Nature or Art, and when any of these, or the com-
<lb break="no"/>pounds made from them, are brought into contact by being
<lb/>placed near or against each other, it is found that their ap-
<lb break="no"/>parent brilliancy is increased, or set off by the contrast, &amp;c.
<lb/>As for instance, Red, when seen by the side of Green, ap-
<lb break="no"/>pears more Red by the contact,—Green being the other two
<lb/>primitives combined into one color. In like manner, Yellow
<lb/>is affected by Purple, and Blue by Orange ; so that for simple
<lb/>contrast, we have but to take one primitive color, no matter
<lb/>which, and combine the other two, to make an opposition
<lb/>to the first, such as all times and nations have accepted as,
<lb/>agreeable to the eye; whereas, any two of the primitive
<lb/>colors, brought directly together, produces a discord, often
<lb/>very harsh and disagreeable in itself, but when skilfully
<lb/>used by the artist, becoming a great power in his hands, to
<lb/>drive together into a more intimate harmony the less discor-
<lb break="no"/>dant colors used.</p><p></p><p>These primitives, when all mixed together, produce Brown.
<lb/>This is the universal color of Nature, and the grand harmo-
<lb break="no"/>nizer of those old masters, who understood colors the best;
<lb/>and which Brown, many moderns have observed as making
<lb/>up the greater proportion of the tone of the pictures of the
<lb/>best colorists, and the want of which, in modem schools, as
<lb/>I shall show, is but another proof of that deficiency of know-
<lb break="no"/>ledge of colors in this day, that I have more than hinted at.
<lb/>This Brown color, as I said, being composed of Red,
<lb/>Yellow, and Blue, is capable of infinite variations, as it
<lb/>may pass from reddish-brown to blackish-brown, or yellow-
<lb break="no"/>ish-brown, at the will of the painter; so that, if he desires
<lb/>to make a Red more powerful by the opposition to it of his
<lb/>ground or surrounding color, he has but to make it (the
<lb/>ground) tend in its hue, towards greenish-brown ; or if he
<lb/>would merge it in, or harmonize it with the surrounding
<lb/>ground-color, he makes the aforesaid ground of a reddish-
<lb break="no"/>brown, for these two opposite principles of harmony and con-
<lb break="no"/>trast, comprehend all that this external application of color
<lb/>can do. For, when the painter would make any one of the</p><p></p><p>primitive colors more striking to the eye, he surrounds it with
<lb/>a compound mostly composed of the other two, thereby form-
<lb break="no"/>ing the greatest opposition; and when he would harmonize
<lb/>or soften its effect to the eye, he uses least of these opposites.
<lb/>A few experiments made on white paper in water colors,
<lb/>with Red, Yellow, and Blue, will soon enable any artist to
<lb/>thread all the intricacies of the whole scale of color, and their
<lb/>possible oppositions and harmonies, as matter of mere con-
<lb break="no"/>trast and harmony of external color. This, and what grows
<lb/>immediately out of this, is all the superficial knowledge of
<lb/>what is called the present English School of Painting, of
<lb/>which we Americans have taken to ourselves more than can
<lb/>do us good, unless we learn better where to bestow it, in its
<lb/>proper place, subject to higher laws, the laws of the imita-
<lb break="no"/>tion, or the reproduction of Nature’s works.</p><p></p><p>It is so notorious as to cause comment to be made the
<lb/>world over, wherever there are to be found modern, and
<lb/>good old Pictures, that the new are light, or white and fee-
<lb break="no"/>ble, or glaring in color, when compared with the old, or even
<lb/>good copies from them. The Royal Academy Exhibitions
<lb/>strike all observers in this, whether they be Englishmen or
<lb/>Americans, as being an assemblage of bright colors and
<lb/>white-wash, having no type any where in Nature, but only
<lb/>like itself, or other modern exhibitions of pictures, whether
<lb/>on the continent of Europe, or here in America, ever the same
<lb/>crude, feeble, gray, garish, unharmonised patches of gaudy
<lb/>colors and staring whiteness. Whereas, the better works of
<lb/>the old Painters, particularly those who can lay claim to any
<lb/>knowledge of color, are uniformly found to be low in tone,
<lb/>rich, brown and harmonious, the flesh (the test of color in Art)
<lb/>in that medium between light and dark, where only the great-
<lb break="no"/>est amount of color can be found, so that, the flesh in Titian’s
<lb/>pictures, according to the best critics, is perhaps the lowest
<lb/>in its local color ever painted. This has been variously ac-
<lb break="no"/>counted for by different writers, as owing to the age of the
<lb/>pictures, time being supposed to have sunken them to their
<lb/>present low scale, &amp;c., &amp;c., all of which is insufficient to ex-
<lb break="no"/>plain satisfactorily the fact, as there are even old pictures of
<lb/>Titian’s time, or earlier, as light and crude as any modem
<lb/>English or French, when, if time would have done this thing
<lb/>for one, it would, being no respecter of persons, have done it
<lb/>for all. But there can be given a clear and satisfactory solu-
<lb break="no"/>tion of this problem, that shall show to common sense that
<lb/>instead of its having been lime or accident that has made
<lb/>pictures which were originally bad, or indifferent, good, the
<lb/>painters who produced them really knew the Art which they
<lb/>professed and practised, more thoroughly than those who
<lb/>pretend to this knowledge in these days. Indeed, the old
<lb/>Painters had only Nature to study, from which they drew
<lb/>deep truths, and principles, such as could be safely trusted lo,
<lb/>and did universally produce results, that modems look upon
<lb/>as the offspring of a happier genius, than we are blessed
<lb/>withal; though it was the inevitable consequence of energetic
<lb/>mind, devoted to the analysis of those principles which alone
<lb/>can form a solid basis for true Art, and be learned from Na-
<lb break="no"/>ture, our true school-mistress.</p><p></p><p>Thus much of color as we had treated in this article, before
<lb/>we made this digression, a child of twelve years of age may
<lb/>learn in a few months of teaching; and this has been spun
<lb/>out by various authors, into more volumes than would be ne-
<lb break="no"/>cessary to tell of the whole rise and fall of empires, as well
<lb/>as Arts, yet this is all that modern Art has learned from the
<lb/>wonderful works of earlier Painters, together with what
<lb/>Science has done for us, and the increase of knowledge.</p><p></p><p>In that medium degree, equally removed from the extremes
<lb/>of light and dark, which we mentioned in our first article,
<lb/>occur in nature all the most powerful colors, and no where</p><p><pb n="115"/>
</p><p>else, for more light must weaken, or more dark must obscure
<lb/>them. Thence the necessity that that most difficult of sub-
<lb break="no"/>stances to be imitated, human flesh, should be placed so low
<lb/>in the scale of light, as to allow all the purest color to pass
<lb/>through its plane, or the range of light which it occupies in the
<lb/>picture. This, any man may see the truth of, who has endea-
<lb break="no"/>vored conscientiously to copy nature, or even looked atten-
<lb break="no"/>tively at such copy, when it is made.</p><p></p><p>We now see a good reason why good old pictures are low
<lb/>in tone, not dark, or black, as too many of the specimens
<lb/>that reach our shores are, for if their lowness of tone is truly
<lb/>attained, it is so deceptive as to seem to reflect more light,
<lb/>than the lightest picture gives out.</p><p></p><p>Such modern pictures as are an approach in lowness of
<lb/>tone to either nature or the works of true colorists, are liable
<lb/>to be what is termed leathery, and grow more and more so
<lb/>with every year after being painted ; whereas the old have
<lb/>almost the tenderness of nature, which tenderness is the very
<lb/>opposite of the leathery quality; this latter quality increases
<lb/>by the darkening of the surface of the color, and is often in-
<lb break="no"/>creased by the changing of the oils. It is so common in the
<lb/>English pictures where there is an attempt to paint on a low
<lb/>key, that all kinds of vehicles are supposed to be better, as
<lb/>they seem to promise to overcome this difficulty, which they
<lb/>attribute to the use of Megilps, &amp;c. &amp;c. But it has a deep-
<lb break="no"/>er origin. The truth is, that whenever colors are used, no
<lb/>matter how pure they be, in a picture, their tendency will be
<lb/>to change darker on the surface, thereby becoming leathery,
<lb/>for this is the inevitable quality of darker, and particularly
<lb/>the warmer colored browns, passed over lighter and left so.
<lb/>Now the opposite quality of the leathery is always produced
<lb/>by passing a lighter opaque color over a darker one. This,
<lb/>when known and well applied, will enable any one to rid his
<lb/>pictures of this quality, though the flesh be as low as that
<lb/>of Titian, and without which I believe that even he would
<lb/>have worked in vain to produce any approach to nature,
<lb/>such as he has made, this being the way of nature herself,
<lb/>and therefore the best.</p><p></p><p>Now as human flesh occurs in this medium degree between
<lb/>light and dark, which, we have mentioned, is composed of
<lb/>the three primitive colors, in such subtle arrangement as to
<lb/>baffle all attempts of mere eye, and hand in monkey imita-
<lb break="no"/>tion, to render them intelligibly, and must yet be given be-
<lb break="no"/>fore any thing can be done worthy of our opportunities, and
<lb/>what has been accomplished by others in less inteliigent
<lb/>times, let us try to follow the light which nature presents in
<lb/>the investigation of her works, and the analysis of her prin-
<lb break="no"/>ciples. For we cannot by studying the pictures of the old
<lb/>masters, as we can in nature, separate the layers of color
<lb/>used in their progress, nor learn the mode of their produc-
<lb break="no"/>tion, now when the hands that executed, and the minds that
<lb/>produced them have gone beyond the reach of our question-
<lb break="no"/>ing, and left us nothing but the results of their labors, from
<lb/>which we barely learn that they alone, of all the professed
<lb/>disciples of Art, have understood the language even, in
<lb/>which Art must speak or remain tongue-tied, or at the best
<lb/>lisp, like a little child, but more like an aged man, that has
<lb/>reached his second childishness, and fills up the hour with
<lb/>bis empty babble.</p><p></p><p>But I doubt not that we shall be able to show that there
<lb/>is yet a way to attain to what now makes them “ the Divine
<lb/>in Art;" so conspicuous above us; and that by the simplest
<lb/>means, such as could not but have been suggested to reason-
<lb break="no"/>ing minds, of sufficient self-dependence to throw aside all,
<lb/>that they had not themselves tested, as worthless, beginning
<lb/>anew in the true school of nature, as children who have the</p><p>whole Art to learn, and not taking for granted any thing but
the deductions of their own reason or experience.
</p><p>Now I propose to give the sketch of a process whereby a
<lb/>head may be painted, and though from the complicated na-
<lb break="no"/>ture of words, and particularly when used by one who has
<lb/>had other things than words to study, as in my case, I can-
<lb break="no"/>not hope to make it simple to the simple, though if it be
<lb/>well thought over, and applied with tolerable skill, will prove
<lb/>its truth in the success—at least showing its capacity for the
<lb/>grandest results. At all events, let no man condemn it un-
<lb break="no"/>til he can see a flaw in the reasoning, or has tested its truth
<lb/>or falseness, by an actual experiment—when, if he cannot
<lb/>produce a better picture by it, I fear not to declare that he
<lb/>cannot produce a good one at all.</p><p>WHY ARE NOT THE SCIENCES BETTER UNDERSTOOD ?
</p><p>Under this head it is proposed to make a simple inquiry,
<lb/>which doubtless thousands can answer with quite as little
<lb/>trouble, as it is to propound the question. But though thou-
<lb break="no"/>sands can give a ready answer to the inquiry, yet there are
<lb/>millions who cannot, and therefore, it is to them that the
<lb/>question may more properly be put—“ why the Sciences are
<lb/>not better understood ?” That it is a lamentable fact, that
<lb/>the phenomena of many of the simple and most practical
<lb/>things of life are not understood, no one will deny—why this
<lb/>is the case is the question. It cannot be that there is not
<lb/>sufficient interest in these phenomena; because it is well
<lb/>known that the understanding of the laws which explain
<lb/>these things are more conducive to the happiness of mankind
<lb/>than all other knowledge put together. In fact, civilization
<lb/>could not progress without it, and though thousands and
<lb/>thousands are applying the laws every day, yet they do
<lb/>not know how they do it. Every woman and child is apply-
<lb break="no"/>ing some one of the laws for their comfort every day of their
<lb/>lives, yet, how few are they of this great mass of persons,
<lb/>even if the adults be taken, that can explain the reason why
<lb/>they are warmer in a woollen blanket than in a cotton one of
<lb/>equal weight ?—or why a man may go into an oven, dressed
<lb/>in a woollen cloak, and remain there long enough to broil a
<lb/>beef steak, without being injured, while in any other gar-
<lb break="no"/>ment he would be roasted alive—or why a white hat is cool-
<lb break="no"/>er than a black one—or why a rough stove, gives off more
<lb/>heat than a polished one—or a black stove more than a tin
<lb/>one. Now, that these are but few of the simple questions of
<lb/>well-known facts of every day occurrence, cannot be doubted;
<lb/>but, as simple as they are, and as easily as they could be an-
<lb break="no"/>swered by any child, if once directed to the subject, there
<lb/>are thousands who never for a moment give their attention
<lb/>to the subject. But these are not the only illustrations, be-
<lb break="no"/>cause there are the several branches of science, equally as
<lb/>applicable to phenomena around us.</p><p></p><p>The subject of heat however is applied to such practical
<lb/>purposes, that it is singular that it should not be more under-
<lb break="no"/>stood--and particularly the laws which would explain many</p><p></p><p>of the phenomena of heat, experienced almost every minute
<lb/>in the day. The apparent cold of iron, on taking hold of it,
<lb/>or heat of wood, is so well known, that it would be superflu-
<lb break="no"/>ous to mention it; were it not equally as apparent that a
<lb/>great majority of persons do not know why it is so. They
<lb/>know that it is so, because it gives them a painful sensation
<lb/>on a frosty morning to pick up an iron bar, while a piece of
<lb/>wood that has lain beside it, and is of the same tempera-
<lb break="no"/>ture, is much warmer to handle. The simple fact of wrap-
<lb break="no"/>ping up a piece of ice in a woollen blanket to preserve it, is
<lb/>known to every porter in the country, yet how few can tell</p><p><pb n="116"/>
</p><p>why it is that the blanket which is warmest in winter, will
<lb/>not melt ice in the summer,—or why a black or blue blanket
<lb/>would melt the ice when a white one would preserve it.</p><p></p><p>These things are of so common an occurrence, that it
<lb/>would be natural to suppose every person would know
<lb/>them; yet it is far from being the case. This want of
<lb/>knowledge on these every day matters does not speak much
<lb/>for the information of those who are not in possession of it.
<lb/>The simple operation of a pump, which every boy has work-
<lb break="no"/>ed at many a time, is apparently one of the least under-
<lb break="no"/>stood. A majority of the young men, who are exceed-
<lb break="no"/>ingly well dressed, would be apt to say, “ that a pump
<lb/>sucks the water up from the well”—if asked for an explana-
<lb break="no"/>tion of the operation of pumping—or if a similar enquiry
<lb/>were to be made to a young man of considerable accom-
<lb break="no"/>plishments in a ball room, but engaged in the liquor
<lb/>trade, why it is that the syphon he uses to take liquors
<lb/>from a cask performs the operation, he would be very likely
<lb/>to say by suction, which certainly is one of the vulgar ways
<lb/>of exhausting a pipe of liquor, but nevertheless is far from
<lb/>being the true cause for that simple operation.</p><p></p><p>All have more or less used the “ sucker,” as it is usually
<lb/>termed by boys, in raising up bricks or other smooth sub-
<lb break="no"/>stances, by means of a piece of wet leather patted down on
<lb/>it. This simple operation is as equally one of the known
<lb/>laws of pneumatics as that of the atmospheric rail-road;
<lb/>and the laws which govern one would explain that of the
<lb/>other.</p><p></p><p>The pressure of fifteen pounds to the square inch of the
<lb/>atmosphere, may easily be conceived to be an extraordinary
<lb/>amount of force to be applied. The pressure on the human
<lb/>body to a person not acquainted with the laws of pneumatics,
<lb/>seems to be incredible. That there should be a pressure of
<lb/>about fifteen tons on the human body, makes a person of con-
<lb break="no"/>siderable good sense look a little credulous at the idea of his
<lb/>having to shoulder such a load as that every day; and he
<lb/>would very soon begin to imagine that the burdens of this
<lb/>life were great indeed. But if in addition to this, he were
<lb/>told that on a rainy day, when the “ atmosphere was so heavy
<lb/>and thick," that two or three tons of atmospheric pressure
<lb/>were taken off his shoulders, he would he very likely to say,
<lb/>“ Come—come, Mr. Philosopher, that is putting it on, and
<lb/>taking it off rather too thick. What! on a rainy day the at-
<lb break="no"/>mosphere lighter than on a bright sun-shining day ? See
<lb/>here, sir, can you tell how many beans five blue beans make,
<lb/>if shook up in a bag?” Now as ridiculous as all this ap-
<lb break="no"/>pears, it nevertheless is true.</p><p></p><p>Many young persons have this impression on their mind,
<lb/>and unfortunately have such a particular desire to be accom-
<lb break="no"/>plished gentlemen, to be familiar with the name of Signora
<lb/>Pico, and others of the opera—or the last new step in the
<lb/>Polka dance, and other amusements of the sort, that they
<lb/>would not know these simple every day things, because they
<lb/>are not fashionable.</p><p></p><p>It would be idle to attempt to illustrate this subject as
<lb/>fully as it would permit, as it would occupy too much space.
<lb/>And the cases that have been cited are only such as are of
<lb/>such simple use, that it is much to be wondered at, that
<lb/>they cannot be as thoroughly explained by any young man,
<lb/>as can the tune of the last new opera, the steps in a qua-
<lb break="no"/>drille, or the latest cut of the Imperial or Moustache of some
<lb/>recently imported German or French Count. If this were
<lb/>the case, it would be a source of great credit to the young
<lb/>men generally ; but unfortunately it cannot be done.</p><p>The love of some of the frivolities of the day, have more
attractions than the useful sciences; whether it is that the
</p><p>name of science conveys to the mind of the young man the
<lb/>idea of something very abstruse, requiring minds like those of
<lb/>Bacon, Galileo, Newton and Franklin, to explore their mys-
<lb break="no"/>teries, it is difficult to say; but it is very natural to suppose
<lb/>that something of this kind must deter them from the enqui-
<lb break="no"/>ry, or else they would make a venture to read such works as
<lb/>Brewster’s Optics, Arnott’s Physics, and hundreds of other
<lb/>volumes, which would not only be more valuable to them
<lb/>than most reading that they could undertake, but would be
<lb/>equally as pleasing; for it is an absurdity to suppose that
<lb/>science has no pleasures, because all the phenomena in na-
<lb break="no"/>ture can be explained by her laws; and how much more
<lb/>gratifying it must be to any person to be able to explain the
<lb/>causes of these phenomena. Most truly, the satisfaction of
<lb/>being able to set a person right, who has stumbled into
<lb/>the error that ice is formed at the bottom of the river, and
<lb/>then rises up to the surface to be dovetailed together, would
<lb/>be more pleasing, as well as more to the credit of the person,
<lb/>than being able to correct a false step at a cotillion.</p><p></p><p>This error is not an imaginary case, but one of real occu-
<lb break="no"/>rence, from a person who possesses as much good sense as
<lb/>the majority of young men, and occupies as respectable a posi-
<lb break="no"/>tion. But it is a case, and not unlike thousands to be met
<lb/>with every day, manifesting as much ignorance upon practi-
<lb break="no"/>cable subjects as to their laws as this. Not knowing these
<lb/>things, does not presuppose want of capacity to understand
<lb/>them; but a want of proper appreciation for their acquisi-
<lb break="no"/>tion. In the cases mentioned there has been no attempt to
<lb/>select such as it is required that a person should be able to
<lb/>answer, because if that were the case he could easily learn
<lb/>by heart the usual modes of explaining their phenomena;
<lb/>but it has been to direct the attention to palpable cases of
<lb/>ignorance, not only of these things, but the application of the
<lb/>laws governing them. They should be known. The laws
<lb/>of mechanism, heat, hydraulics, hydrostatics and pneumatics,
<lb/>as well as of optics, and in fact all phenomena of na-
<lb break="no"/>ture, should be as well understood ns that of any species of
<lb/>learning knowu. Every person can appreciate this know-
<lb break="no"/>ledge. There is a tangible form to it, by which, through
<lb/>life, it can be made available in more ways than one to pro-
<lb break="no"/>mote happiness. While the same may not be said of the
<lb/>advantages from reading the best of Scott’s, or other novels
<lb/>and romances that can be found. They may afford some
<lb/>pleasure to excite the mind, and leave pleasing recollections
<lb/>of such characters as Ivanhoe and Rebecca; but they never
<lb/>can give as much pleasure as would be derived from the
<lb/>knowledge of these laws. Besides the pleasure of being able
<lb/>to explain these phenomena, it has the great advantage of
<lb/>leading to many useful inventions. On the subject of heat
<lb/>alone, there is field enough yet to exhaust the mind of some
<lb/>halt a dozen Davy's, in applying it to the most advantage for
<lb/>manufacturing purposes, and that of warming houses. For
<lb/>it is a fact that there is double the quantity of fuel used in
<lb/>houses to warm them, that is required, owing to the simple
<lb/>circumstance of not knowing how to use it. Fuel generally
<lb/>is but half consumed, and even of that which is consumed, a
<lb/>great portion of it is lost, owing to the bad arrangement of
<lb/>radiation. Enquiries into this matter may be made by any
<lb/>one—and though a Davy or Farraday might be able to dis-
<lb break="no"/>cover the mode of economising fuel sooner than a mere su-
<lb break="no"/>perficial reader of the subject, yet it does not follow that
<lb/>they may not turn the knowledge to good account, with a
<lb/>possibility of making an improvement on the mode of using
<lb/>fuel to generate steam, or for warming houses. In chemis-
<lb break="no"/>try the application of its principles are so universal, that
<lb/>nothing is touched but is governed by its laws. The bread</p><p><pb n="117"/>
</p><p>that is partaken of at each meal, has to be made by as fixed
<lb/>laws of chemistry, as that of preparing gases—or the boiling
<lb/>of potatoes by equally as well known chemical laws ; yet of
<lb/>the millions who eat of the bread and potatoes, if they
<lb/>were told that there was a science in boiling the potatoes,
<lb/>they would be likely to think it rather too “ small potatoe”
<lb/>a science, for them to condescend to learn its laws. It would
<lb/>not be genteel to know how a potatoe was boiled, or why it
<lb/>changed from a nasty hard vegetable, to a delicate bread-like
<lb/>substance, by simply putting it into boiling water. But
<lb/>though it might not be genteel, it would certainly be very
<lb/>creditable, and perhaps detract none the less from any per-
<lb break="no"/>son’s claims to gentility to be in possession of such an amount
<lb/>of knowledge. In fact, the elementary principles of physics
<lb/>should be more thoroughly studied in the schools, and forced
<lb/>upon the mind of the child, that he may, on coming to matu-
<lb break="no"/>rity, feel more interest in the subject. As it is now, most
<lb/>young men have no inclination that way. The name of sci-
<lb break="no"/>ence has too much of the abstruse about it to attract the at-
<lb break="no"/>tention ; and the extravagant notions of gentility, which the
<lb/>great mass of the young men in the city have, of patronizing
<lb/>the operas and Pinteux—and the young and old and junior
<lb/>bachelor’s balls, or getting a red flannel shirt on to run after
<lb/>an engine or hose cart, have become a serious evil to them.
<lb/>Their love of these amusements, without a proper cultivation
<lb/>of the mind, has had the tendency to lower very much the
<lb/>estimated intelligence among them; though in dress, and
<lb/>general appearance, they betray all the accomplishments of
<lb/>very learned gentlemen, and it is not until you put to them
<lb/>any of the simple questions of natural philosophy that it is
<lb/>discovered they are not what they appear to be, that all
<lb/>is not gold that glitters—and that a tailor has made the more
<lb/>pleasing part of them.</p><p>C. L. BARRITT.
THE GREAT TOWER OF TARUDANT.
BT ROBERT OLIVER.
</p><p>So Arphaxad proceeded with a step that constantly grew
<lb/>bolder and more vigorous. He removed the most faithful
<lb/>officers of the king, and supplied their places by creatures of
<lb/>his own—evil spirits whom his magic had clothed with the
<lb/>form and flesh of humanity. He issued all orders, heard all
<lb/>complaints, judged all causes, and in fine assumed all the
<lb/>royal functions, which he exercised without deigning even to
<lb/>consult the king. Upon the latter, indeed, he at length
<lb/>dared to lay a spell, under the influence of which the monarch
<lb/>shut himself up in the interior of his palace, and spent his
<lb/>whole time in studying books of magic and in practising in-
<lb break="no"/>cantations, the mode of performing which, the Egyptian had
<lb/>pretended to teach him ; but in these he never could succeed,
<lb/>for the spell of the crafty magician so besotted his brain that
<lb/>he understood little of what he read, and remembered not one
<lb/>half of the purposely obscure and complicated instructions he
<lb/>had received.</p><p></p><p>But though reduced to this pitiable state, Abdallah yet
<lb/>loved, and had faith in the Egyptian, for so strongly was he
<lb/>charmed, that he did not perceive his own condition, but still
<lb/>believed himself a king, and thought that bis industrious vi-
<lb break="no"/>zier merely relieved him of the toils and cares of government,
<lb/>that he might have leisure for loftier and more agreeable
<lb/>pursuits. Neither were the people dissatisfied, for though
<lb/>they now never saw their king, they doubted not that his
<lb/>retirement was owing to his intense devotion to the affairs of
<lb/>the kingdom; and so long as those were well administered,
<lb/>they cared little what passed within the palace.</p><p></p><p>Emboldened by impunity, Arphaxad allowed his ambition
<lb/>full play. He proclaimed his intention of building in the
<lb/>very centre of the city of Tarudant, a tower that should ex-
<lb break="no"/>ceed in size and magnificence all that the world had ever
<lb/>seen. And the people shouted and applauded the underta-
<lb break="no"/>king, as one that would confer great glory on the nation.</p><p></p><p>Nor was their approbation lessened, when they were called
<lb/>upon to labor at the work, and to contribute of their gold
<lb/>and silver and precious stones towards its embellishment;
<lb/>lor the Egyptian persuaded them that inconceivable benefits
<lb/>would flow from its erection. So, cheerfully they commenced
<lb/>the building, not dismayed, though a tenth part and that the
<lb/>fairest of their city was demolished to make room for the
<lb/>foundation. Cheerfully they labored, willingly they con-
<lb break="no"/>tributed of their wealth, and rapidly rose the tower. Story
<lb/>after story was added, each more magnificent than the other,
<lb/>until at length so great a height was reached, that the work-
<lb break="no"/>men on the top could barely be discerned from the ground.</p><p></p><p>The work went briskly on. Multitudes of supernaturally
<lb/>stout and active genies toiled side by side with human la-
<lb break="no"/>borers, and architects of more than mortal craft guided the
<lb/>progress of the structure. Materials became scarce, and first
<lb/>the great wall of Tarudant, and then its chief houses and
<lb/>those of the provincial cities were thrown down to support
<lb/>them, and finally the royal palace itself was demolished,
<lb/>with the exception of the single apartment to which the king
<lb/>had of late confined himself. '</p><p></p><p>Still the people were called upon, and still the people
<lb/>came to labor. More and more of their riches was demand-
<lb break="no"/>ed, and yet it was freely given. Higher, higher rose the
<lb/>tower, piercing far above the clouds, and seeming to enter
<lb/>the very heavens. The supply of stones was not yet suffi-
<lb break="no"/>cient. The public works which had conferred such pros-
<lb break="no"/>perity upon Tarudant, the canals, roads, bridges, and aque-
<lb break="no"/>ducts were despoiled, and their granite and marble added to
<lb/>the mighty edifice.</p><p></p><p>At length it was finished, and wonderful indeed was the
<lb/>work. Prodigious in breadth as well as height, superb with
<lb/>many-hued marbles, with the finest porphyry, the most trans-
<lb break="no"/>parent alabaster, glowing with gold and gems, and brilliant
<lb/>with silver, brass, and ivory. Immediately on its completion,
<lb/>Arphaxad dismissed the human laborers, and accompanied
<lb/>only by his attendant genies, of whom he had gathered an
<lb/>innumerable host, entered the tower and shut himself up
<lb/>therein.</p><p></p><p>And now the people, having nearly spent their strength,
<lb/>and entirely exhausted their treasure in the building of this
<lb/>tower, looked up at it with pride and exultation, and waited
<lb/>for the blessings that the Egyptian had promised should flow
<lb/>from it. They waited in vain. Nothing came, nothing de-
<lb break="no"/>scended. Still they waited, still in vain. They began to
<lb/>murmur, for they lacked bread, having neglected to till their
<lb/>lands while working for the magician, and having parted
<lb/>with every thing wherewith they might have bought bread
<lb/>in other countries. Their murmurs swelled to complaints
<lb/>and reproaches, not unmingled with curses. They called
<lb/>loudly upon the Egyptian, who answered not, for he was
<lb/>busied with his incantations in the highest story of the tow-
<lb break="no"/>er, where their mightiest shouts were heard only as the gent-
<lb break="no"/>lest whispering of the west wind. Maddened to desperation,
<lb/>they at length assaulted the building, each man catching up
<lb/>a stone and hurling it against the great brazen gates. They
<lb/>flew open, and the multitude rushed in. When a fifth part
<lb/>had entered, the gates closed again with a tremulous roar,
<lb/>crushing many who were pressing for admittance.</p><p></p><p>The multitude found themselves in a vast circular hall,
<lb/>the floor of which was of rough rocks, and the lofty sides
<lb/>cased with broad plates of gold, highly burnished, but with-
<lb break="no"/>out figure or inscription. The ceiling of sculptured ivory, at
<lb/>a height beyond the reach of a strongly shot arrow, rested on
<lb/>columns of green marble, around the upper part of whose
<lb/>shafts immense serpents were lazily twining, their hideous
<lb/>heads swaying to and fro, up and down, and uttering occa-
<lb break="no"/>sionally thick hisses, accompanied by a gush of breath so
<lb/>pestiferous that no man could breathe it a moment and live.
<lb/>The eyes of these serpents glared with a vigilant ferocity,
<lb/>though the rest of their bodies seemed immersed in languid
<lb/>indolence, and from those dreadful orbs shone forth the only
<lb/>light which illumined the hall, a light so dim and strange,
<lb/>that when the people first entered, they could see nothing
<lb/>but their own palpitating forms.</p><p></p><p>Stupidly they stared upwards, saying not a word, for the
<lb/>poisonous fumes from above tainted even the air below, pro-
<lb break="no"/>ducing a drowsy feeling in those who inhaled it. At length,
<lb/>some bolder or more impatient than the rest broke the silence,
<lb/>shouting, “ Come, here is gold, let us take it and buy bread!”</p><p>And they all rushed to the sides of the hall and attempted
to tear off the golden plates; but they could not, for the
<pb n="118"/>
</p><p>smooth surface afforded nothing to take hold of, and besides
<lb/>their strength was weakened by hunger and benumbed by the
<lb/>foul vapors they were breathing. They soon desisted, and
<lb/>sought to quit the tower, but there was no outlet save the
<lb/>brazen gates, and those defied their utmost efforts. In despair
<lb/>they flung themselves upon the rocky floor and remained hea-
<lb break="no"/>vily slumbering until midnight, when they were roused by
<lb/>the intolerable thirst produced by the hot and stifling air.
<lb/>They looked up, but there was no light. The serpents were
<lb/>asleep, and their eyes shot forth no gleams. Then amid the
<lb/>thick darkness, all with one voice gasped forth, “Water, wa-
<lb break="no"/>ter, give us water or we die!”</p><p></p><p>Suddenly laughter sounded through the tower, scornful,
<lb/>fiendish laughter, and then again all was still. The serpents
<lb/>awoke, and for a moment swung their heads about uncertain-
<lb break="no"/>ly, then fixed them pointing downwards, and opening wide
<lb/>their mouths, hissed forth floods of waters strong and many,
<lb/>athwart whose rushing foam, danced with fearful glee the
<lb/>lurid light of their infernal eyes. Frantically the multitude
<lb/>drank, but not with pleasure, for the water was bitter and of
<lb/>a sickish warmth. It continued flowing down upon them,
<lb/>and rising, until it reached their knees, then their waists, and
<lb/>presently their armpits. They struggled, shrieked, and beg-
<lb break="no"/>ged for mercy, but the water came pouring down, until it
<lb/>was twenty cubits deep, where the last strong swimmer sunk
<lb/>exhausted, and again horrible laughter pealed throngh the
<lb/>tower, mingled with the triumphant hissing of the serpents
<lb/>and the gentle dashing of the calming waters.</p><p></p><p>Meantime the people without the tower finding that they
<lb/>could not again force open the brazen gates, retired to a little
<lb/>hill some way off and held a consultation. It suddenly occur-
<lb break="no"/>red to them that they yet had a king, who once was good,
<lb/>and wise and brave, and they were astonished that they
<lb/>had even for a moment forgotten him. Great indeed
<lb/>must have been the delusion which could blot out all remem-
<lb break="no"/>brance of the kind and gallant Abdallah. The multitude re-
<lb break="no"/>solved immediately to seek his protection from the evils in
<lb/>which they had been involved by their reliance upon the false
<lb/>Egyptian. “ To the king ! To the king !” they shouted—
<lb/>“ he will deliver us—he will destroy the magician !”</p><p></p><p>In a body therefore they hurried to the royal palace, and
<lb/>there being now no guards or officers of state to prevent in-
<lb break="no"/>trusion, they reached without difficulty the presence of the
<lb/>king. They found the poor monarch in a dismantled, dirty
<lb/>apartment, the sole remnant of his superb ancestral palace.
<lb/>He was reclining on a couch of ivory, adorned with brazen
<lb/>figures, which had once been gilded so skilfuly as not to be
<lb/>distinguishable from pure gold. But these were now rusted
<lb/>over with dingy verdigris, while the ivory itself was so brok-
<lb break="no"/>en and decayed, that had it not been patched here and there
<lb/>with pieces of bone it would not have upheld the body of the
<lb/>king. Little, however, was required to uphold that body.
<lb/>So emaciated, so woe-begone was it, that emirs who for years
<lb/>had waited on the royal person, scarcely recognized their sove-
<lb break="no"/>reign. His eyes were sunken in his head, his beard was en-
<lb break="no"/>ormously long and matted together, and his whole appearance
<lb/>squalid with the accumulated dust and filth of years. He was
<lb/>wrapped in a loose black robe fantastically striped with scar-
<lb break="no"/>let and purple, but so tattered and dirty that its texture and
<lb/>hues were scarcely discernible. Before him on the couch lay
<lb/>a roll of parchment inscribed with mystic characters, on
<lb/>which his eyes were bent with an expression of painful anxi-
<lb break="no"/>ety. At his side was an earthen vessel containing a quantity
<lb/>of dried fish, stale and mouldy, and at the foot of the couch a
<lb/>fountain of muddy water lazily weltered forth from between
<lb/>the jaws of a sculptured leopard.</p><p></p><p>Abdallah did not seem conscious of the approach of his
<lb/>subjects, but continued steadfastly gazing on the magical
<lb/>book. They stood for a time contemplating him, unable to
<lb/>speak, for their hearts were very full. At length an old vizier,
<lb/>mastering his tears and sobs, with trembling voice exclaim-
<lb break="no"/>ed—</p><p></p><p>"Look up, O king, look up and behold thy faithful people
<lb/>who have come to thee in their great distress—have come to
<lb/>thee for refuge and relief.”</p><p></p><p>The king Feebly raising his head, with difficulty opened
<lb/>his mouth and replied:—“Why do ye trouble me in my stu-
<lb break="no"/>dies? Seek Arphaxad the Egyptian. He will do what ye
<lb/>require.” And sinking back upon his couch with a painful
<lb/>sigh, he again fixed his bleared eyes upon the parchment
<lb/>roll.</p><p>But the people groaned, and cried, “ Alas, O King! It is
from this accursed magician that all our miseries flow.”
</p><p>Again Abdallah looked up, and with a sadly bewildered ex-
<lb break="no"/>pression demanded, “Why, what hath he done? Governs
<lb/>he not well and wisely ?”</p><p>“ Come forth, and see with thine own eyes, O king!”
</p><p>They lifted the monarch to his feet, and would have led
<lb/>him out, but he was so feeble that he could not stand.
<lb/>They held him up tenderly, and one of the emirs turning to
<lb/>the people, said, “Run, some of you, and fetch water from
<lb/>the fountain that is beside the tomb of the Santon Sidi Edris
<lb/>—it hath virtue to heal the king’s mind and give his body
<lb/>strength.”</p><p></p><p>Swift young men started away as he spoke, and quickly
<lb/>came back with a jar full of water from the holy fountain.
<lb/>The emirs took it and washed the king, and trimmed his
<lb/>beard, and put upon him new garments of cloth of gold in
<lb/>place of the filthy black robe striped with scarlet and purple.
<lb/>They gave him also of the water to drink and fed him with
<lb/>bread and figs, so that he seemed like a new man, being w on-
<lb break="no"/>derfully refreshed. The spell that bound him so long lost its
<lb/>power. He was restored to his right mind and to his wonted
<lb/>health ; strength returned to his limbs, fire to his eyes, color
<lb/>to his cheeks. He stood among his emirs again like their
<lb/>king, and all the people shouted when they looked upon his
<lb/>face, for hope, long absent, began to swell their shrunken
<lb/>hearts.</p><p></p><p>Then a horse was brought to the king, a young horse,
<lb/>strong and full of fire, on which he mounted and was led to
<lb/>a neighboring hill, whence he could view the condition of
<lb/>bis capital. When he beheld its desolation he was struck
<lb/>with such amazement that he could not speak. But at length
<lb/>finding his voice, he demanded, “Who hath done this?
<lb/>What enemy hath ravaged my city?” All the people an-
<lb break="no"/>swered, “ Arphaxad the Egyptian. He hath done this.”
<lb/>“Where is he?” asked the king. “Behold!” cried they,
<lb/>pointing to the tower.</p><p></p><p>Abdallah looked, and his amazement was greater than be-
<lb break="no"/>fore. Putting spurs to his horse he rode forwards, followed
<lb/>by all the people, until he came in front of the great brazen
<lb/>gates of the tower, when he stopped and gazed upon the
<lb/>wondrous structure. Deep stillness pervaded the edifice;
<lb/>there was no sign of life or habitation about it, except that
<lb/>from the upper part there was gushing forth on every side a
<lb/>thick black smoke which rose in slow whirls till they met
<lb/>above the tower’s top, when they mingled in one vast spiral
<lb/>column that went steadily up till it seemed to reach the sky.
<lb/>There it spread into a dense cloud, that darkened the hea-
<lb break="no"/>vens and kept the blessed sunlight from ever shining on the
<lb/>godless fabric. Birds of gigantic size and monstrous shape,
<lb/>some with twenty wings and some with seven heads, but all
<lb/>with plumage of the brightest green, were flying about the
<lb/>wreathing column, now and then dashing into the smoke and
<lb/>soaring swiftly up into the cloud, or with their vast wings
<lb/>partly folded suffering themselves to sink down till they al-
<lb break="no"/>most touched the tower, But these strange creatures made
<lb/>no sound, and seemed to be idly enjoying the smoke, rather
<lb/>than seeking after prey.</p><p></p><p>Presently the king commanded the trumpets to be sounded,
<lb/>and with a loud voice called upon Arphaxad to throw open
<lb/>the gates and come forth. Thrice he repeated this summons,
<lb/>and at the third time there was a peal as of thunder far up
<lb/>in the air. The people huddled-together and looked eagerly
<lb/>to see what would follow. A door flew open in the middle
<lb/>of the tower, high above their heads, and disclosed the huge
<lb/>form of the Egyptian sheathed in armor of brass set with
<lb/>emeralds. His face could be seen only at moments, because
<lb/>of the smoke that swept in eddies round his head; but its
<lb/>expression was of wrath and disdain.</p><p>“Who is it that makes this turmoil at my gates?” he de-
manded in a voice that sounded like an echo of the thunder.
</p><p>“ Who is it, audacious wretch ? It is the king thy master.
<lb/>Come down, open these gates, and humbly throw thyself at
<lb/>his feet, if thou wouldst avoid the punishment of thy mon-
<lb break="no"/>strous guilt.”</p><p></p><p>The magician laughed scornfully. “ I know not of whom
<lb/>you speak. I have no king, I acknowledge no master. I
<lb/>had forgotten the very existence of the miserable mortal who
<lb/>styles himself such. But if you wish the gates opened, your
<lb/>wish shall be granted.”</p><p></p><p>So speaking, he disappeared within the tower, whose great
<lb/>gates suddenly flew open and let forth a flood of black and
<lb/>stinking water, bearing along in its impetuous flow the
<lb/>corpses of those who had perished in the circular hall. So
<lb/>mighty and swift was the flood that it swept away and</p><p><pb n="119"/>

<lb/>his horse saved the king. The good steed bore him to a hill
<lb/>not far off, where he stopped and looked back at the terrible
<lb/>tower. But there was no time for delay ; as the waters sub-
<lb break="no"/>sided a host of hideous black genies sallied forth, chasing and
<lb/>slaying the frightened multitude. A squadron of them
<lb/>mounted on pale horses and headed by Arphaxad himself pur-
<lb break="no"/>sued the king, who fled eastwardly towards Mount Atlas.
<lb/>On the edge of the desert he was overtaken, and the genies
<lb/>were about to seize him, when a mighty blast of wind swept
<lb/>down from the mountains, and passing by the monarch struck
<lb/>his pursuers with such force that they were all thrown upon
<lb/>the ground, from which none rose alive, except their leader
<lb/>the magician, who bruised and astonished fled fearfully back
<lb/>to his tower.</p><p></p><p>Returning thanks to Allah for this timely interposition,

<lb/>whither he should go, or what he should expect. But some-
<lb break="no"/>thing whispered to his soul that eastward, in Mount Atlas,

AMERICAN PROSE WRITERS.
NO. V.
HENRY T. TUCKERMAN.
</p><p>As a descriptive limner and critical essayist, the fidelity
<lb/>and elegance of Mr. Tuckerman’s pen, have procured for him
<lb/>a large class of admirers, even among those upon whom his
<lb/>vigorous independence of thought is more or less thrown
<lb/>away. His bold paper on Shelley, proved, by the attention
<lb/>it excited, that he possessed far stronger characteristics of
<lb/>mind, than were to be found in the Elia-like felicity of style
<lb/>which constituted his first claim to popularity. Unlike
<lb/>Washington Irving, who, by his melodious combinations of
<lb/>words, frequently satisfies the reader for exceeding diffuse-
<lb break="no"/>ness of ideas, Mr. Tuckerman’s quiet beauty of language, and
<lb/>delicate imagery, often so delight the mind, that we forget
<lb/>for the moment, the noble thoughts which they garbed ; and
<lb/>it is not until we have gratified our sense of harmony, that
<lb/>we fully discern the vigorous ideas which have been thus
<lb/>conveyed to the intellect. Just as in listening to the music
<lb/>of Bellini, we are first struck with its exceeding tenderness,
<lb/>and not until we have bathed our very souls in sweetness, do
<lb/>we realize its mighty suggestiveness.</p><p></p><p>As an essayist, Mr. Tuckerman is almost without a rival.
<lb/>His tales, considered merely as tales, are, we think, less suc-
<lb break="no"/>cessful. They abound in graphic description and in beautiful
<lb/>language, but they are only sketches. Actions, events, the
<lb/>commonplace-ism of outward life, which make up so much
<lb/>of the vraisemblance of a fate, are not his forte. Opinion,
<lb/>sentiment, the great truths of spirit-life, and their application
<lb/>to the daily wants of humanity,—these are the subjects
<lb/>around which his mind and heart find their true occupations.
<lb/>No one looks with gentler eye upon his kind ; in no heart is
<lb/>the fountain of sympathy more generous in its outpourings.
<lb/>But he seeks to do good to man, not by beguiling him from
<lb/>himself with some well-constructed fiction, but rather by
<lb/>bringing him to the well-spring of truth, that he may drink
<lb/>and live.</p><p></p><p>“ Isabel of Sicily” was evidently designed to embody the
<lb/>results of the author’s observations during a residence upon
<lb/>that beautiful island. To avoid the egotism usually found in
<lb/>a traveller’s journal, Mr. Tuckerman has woven a light web
<lb/>of romance, and upon that embroiders his facts, thus adopting
<lb/>a precisely opposite course from that of most writers. To its
<lb/>somewhat injudicious title, may be attributed its want of im-
<lb break="no"/>mediate popularity in this country, while running through
<lb/>two editions in England. They who disdain to suffer their
<lb/>intellect to dally with any thing but truth, are deterred from
<lb/>looking into a work bearing so fanciful a name, while the
<lb/>inveterate devourer of fiction is lamentably disappointed, be-
<lb break="no"/>cause the anticipated novel is not a story of Italian passion.
<lb/>Yet no one can look into the book a second time, without be-
<lb break="no"/>ing struck with the acuteness, the clearness of perception,
<lb/>and the high-toned philosophy of its accomplished author.</p><p></p><p>The “ Italian Sketch-book” is free from this trifling defect
<lb/>of mere mechanical form, and at an earlier period of our lite-
<lb break="no"/>rary history, when there were more readers and fewer wri-
<lb break="no"/>ters, would have instantly secured to its author an enviable
<lb/>reputation. We say fewer writers, not because Mr. Tucker-
<lb break="no"/>man has been eclipsed among the many ; but simply because
<lb/>writing has now become a trade, and, like all other trades,
<lb/>it is so overstocked, that trickery of all sorts is necessary to
<lb/>secure a clique of readers for each aspirant after fame, while
<lb/>the true author, disdaining the petty arts of the mere popu-
<lb break="no"/>larity-seekers, is often unheard amid the din of noisy de-
<lb break="no"/>claimers.</p><p></p><p>But, as we said before, it is as the essayist, and especially
<lb/>the critical essayist, that Mr. Tuckerman occupies his true
<lb/>position.</p><p></p><p>“ We confess a partiality for the essay. In the literature of our
<lb/>vernacular tongue it shines conspicuous, and it is environed with the
<lb/>most pleasing associations. The essay is to prose literature, what the
<lb/>sonnet is to poetry; and, as the narrow limits of the latter have en-
<lb break="no"/>closed some of the most beautiful poetic imagery, and finished expres-
<lb break="no"/>sions of sentiment, within the compass of versified writing, so, many
<lb/>of the most chaste specimens of elegant periods, and of animated and
<lb/>embellished prose, exist in the form of essays. * * * A volume of
<lb/>essays subserves the purpose of a set of cabinet pictures, or a port-
<lb break="no"/>folio of miniature drawings; they are the multum in parvo of litera-
<lb break="no"/>ture ; and, perused, as they generally are, in moments of respite from
<lb/>ordinary occupation, turned to on the spur of mental appetite, they
<lb/>not unfrequently prove more efficient than belles-lettres allurements of
<lb/>greater pretension.”</p><p></p><p>Such are Mr. Tuckerman's remarks upon the essay in his
<lb/>beautiful paper on the “ Characteristics of Lamb.”  He has
<lb/>done much towards proving his own assertions, and illustra-
<lb break="no"/>ting his own apt comparison, for not only has he written the
<lb/>most finished essays, but his hand has also framed the most
<lb/>Shakesperian sonnets ever penned on this side of the great
<lb/>waters. His “ Rambles and Reviews” is a book to be left
<lb/>lying on one’s table,—to be taken up in those moods of the
<lb/>mind, when, wearied with the petty details of common-place
<lb/>outer life, we seek refreshment at the well-spring of poetic
<lb/>truth. The sketches of Italian life and scenery are at once
<lb/>graphic and suggestive. They are like Claude Lorraine pic-
<lb break="no"/>tures, not only truthfully drawn and colored, but also possess-
<lb break="no"/>ing that indescribable charm of atmosphere, which seems to
<lb/>transport one instantly to the very scene depicted.</p><p></p><p>Yet, if we were called on to rescue any one portion of Mr.
<lb/>Tuckerman’s prose works from destruction, we should cer-
<lb break="no"/>tainly lay hold of his “ Thoughts on the Poets.” Never did
<lb/>the true spirit of poetry find a nobler exponent. If any one
<lb/>doubts this, let him only read the essay on Goldsmith, full
<lb/>of a fine discriminating sense of the truthfulness and simpli-
<lb break="no"/>city which made “poor Goldsmith” so winning as a friend,
<lb/>so delightful as a writer; then let him turn to the criticism
<lb/>on Pope, contained in the same volume. Compare the ap-
<lb break="no"/>preciating warmth with which the critic speaks of the poet,
<lb/>who</p><p></p><p>“ Cherished throughout his whole life an earnest faith in one better
<lb/>nature; who realized the universal beauty and power of Love; who
<lb/>rejoiced in the exercise of all those tender and noble sentiments which
<lb/>are so much more honorable to man than the highest triumphs of
<lb/>mind—</p><p>Compare this with his clear and critical perception of Pope,
</p><p>“ The bright enamel of whose rhymes is like a frozen lake, over
<lb/>which we glide like a skater before the wind, surrounded by a glitter-
<lb break="no"/>ing landscape of snow.”</p><p></p><p>The hallowed mystery of a gentle mind, diseased beyond
<lb/>all leech-craft,—the thrilling picture of a soul full of love and
<lb/>truth, o’ertasking its powers until it found only darkness in
<lb/>the infinite,—the melancholy image of a spirit framed but
<lb/>to fine issues, yet yielding its tones to the rude touch of ap-
<lb break="no"/>petite, were never more delicately and powerfully depicted
<lb/>than in Mr. Tuckerman’s criticisms on Cowper, Shelley, and
<lb/>Burns. Each of those gifted minds could say</p><p></p><p>“ My spirit’s bark Is driven
<lb/>Far from the shore, far from the trembling throng
<lb/>Whose sails were never to the tempest given</p><p></p><p>but few, even of their most ardent admirers, could have af-
<lb break="no"/>forded so discriminating and philosophic an extenuation of
<lb/>the errors which the brightness of their fame made visible to
<lb/>the world.</p><p></p><p>Whether he portrays characters like these, or points us to
<lb/>the more sparkling fancy of Moore, uttering itself in song,—
<lb/>the chivalric muse of Campbell, breathing its trumpet-voiced
<lb/>appeal in measured, but heart-thrilling tones,—the fierce and</p><p><pb n="120"/>
</p><p>passionate spirit of Alfieri proclaiming its powerful will in
<lb/>Tuscan language but in Runic verse, he ever hears the low
<lb/>breathed moaning of that oracle which dwells in the sanctu-
<lb break="no"/>ary of the poet's heart. Himself a true poet, in the highest
<lb/>and loftiest sense of the term, he knows how to interpret the
<lb/>dark sayings of humanity.</p><p></p><p>Should it be supposed that the interest of these essays may
<lb/>depend much upon the associations connected with their sub-
<lb break="no"/>ject, and that therefore they afford no fair test of Mr. Tuck-
<lb break="no"/>erman’s powers, we would refer to his “ Lyrical Poetry,” and
<lb/>his “ Thoughts on Music,” as evidences of his poetic taste
<lb/>and sensibility, while, for vigor of thought, elegance of dic-
<lb break="no"/>tion, and aptness of illustration, we can find nothing finer in
<lb/>our literature, than the “ Philosophy of Travel,”* and “ New
<lb/>England Philosophy.”* The latter, especially, is remarkable
<lb/>for its close analysis of, and its unanswerable arguments
<lb/>against those modes of thinking and acting, which would
<lb/>subject the warm impulses of the generous heart to the cold
<lb/>dictation of the calculating head.	e.</p><p>* Published in the Democratic Review.
CITY AMUSEMENTS.
</p><p>It is a matter of astonishment, that among all the benevo-
<lb break="no"/>lent enterprises of the day, no society has yet been formed
<lb/>for the purpose of inquiring into and bettering the amuse-
<lb break="no"/>ments of the people. It is a subject of vast importance, and
<lb/>one worthy of commanding the attention of reformers and
<lb/>philanthropists. The school-room, the church and the press,
<lb/>undergo a continual supervision by legal and self-constituted
<lb/>committees, to see that the public mind be not corrupted by
<lb/>improper aliment. But the Theatre, the Circus, and other
<lb/>places of public amusement, are shunned, as though good
<lb/>people could be contaminated by breathing even their names.
<lb/>Yet the minds of the young are more powerfully affected
<lb/>in their amusements, than in their studies, and deeper im-
<lb break="no"/>pressions are made upon their hearts in the unguarded relax-
<lb break="no"/>ation of places of recreation, than while listening to weari-
<lb break="no"/>some lectures or long doctrinal sermons. Unhappily, the
<lb/>theatre has been so managed for many years in this city, that
<lb/>a man or woman of delicate sensibilities could not visit it.
<lb/>But those who have the good of their fellow-beings at heart
<lb/>are not allowed to indulge in squeamish feelings; and a vir-
<lb break="no"/>tuous motive will preserve the garments of the adventurer
<lb/>from contagion, even in passing through the rabble rout of
<lb/>Comus. It is therefore a duly which good men owe to soci-
<lb break="no"/>ety to overlook the amusements of the people, and when they
<lb/>cannot abolish a pernicious amusement, they must strive to
<lb/>improve it.</p><p></p><p>It seems to be quite impossible to extinguish the love of
<lb/>dramatic representations. It is one of the earliest tempta-
<lb break="no"/>tions which beset youth ; and the entire management of the
<lb/>theatre being in the hands of unprincipled and mercenary
<lb/>managers, the stage has become a prolific source of corrup-
<lb break="no"/>tion to our young men. But it should not be so; and it is
<lb/>the duty of the conservators of our morals to see that the
<lb/>abuses of the stage, as well as the abuses of the school-room,
<lb/>be abolished. It is by no means unusual to hear our preach-
<lb break="no"/>ers denounce the theatre, without ever having been inside of
<lb/>one; and pronounce anathemas against practices which ne-
<lb break="no"/>ver had an existence. Of course, those whom it is intended
<lb/>to benefit by such means only laugh at the ignorance of their
<lb/>instructors, and persevere in their wicked courses. Our city
<lb/>preachers and teachers should go the rounds of our public
<lb/>places of amusement, that they might suggest suitable reme-
<lb break="no"/>dies for their evils, if any exist. Our foreign missionaries
<lb/>inquire diligently into the practices of the heathen among
<lb/>whom they are sent, and become very learned in all the enor-
<lb break="no"/>mities of pagan worship; they could not combat successfully</p><p></p><p>with their evil influences unless they thoroughly understood
<lb/>their origin ; neither can our domestic missionaries contend
<lb/>with the vices which it is their aim to overcome, unless they
<lb/>thoroughly understand them.</p><p></p><p>The Bishop of London is reported to have made, recently,
<lb/>a visit in disguise, in company with other benevolent men,
<lb/>to the lowest haunts of the metropolis; that, by seeing the
<lb/>actual condition of the lower orders, he might be able to act
<lb/>intelligently in his endeavors to reform them. This is the
<lb/>only way in which any good can be done by moral reformers.
<lb/>Let those who declaim against theatres go to the theatres,
<lb/>and learn with their own eyes what it is that is offensive in
<lb/>dramatic representations. Many, we have no doubt, would
<lb/>be struck with the fine morality of the plays, the purity of
<lb/>the dialogue, the correct deportment of the actors, and the
<lb/>forcible lessons of life which the stage presents even in its
<lb/>lowest and most degraded condition ; and they would doubt-
<lb break="no"/>less be astonished that an amusement of so refined a nature,
<lb/>and so capable of conveying moral impressions, should suffer
<lb/>from the denunciations of religious men. But let them leave
<lb/>the stage, and turn to the filthy coffee-rooms and punch-
<lb break="no"/>rooms of the lobbies, where abandoned men and women min-
<lb break="no"/>gle freely together, where every inducement to licentiousness
<lb/>and debauchery is held out to the young, as if on purpose to
<lb/>counteract any good impression which the stage may have
<lb/>made,—and they would no longer wonder that the Theatre
<lb/>was denounced by the professedly virtuous ; but they might
<lb/>well wonder why these filthy holes should be appended to
<lb/>the theatre, while the lecture-room, the concert-room, and
<lb/>all other places of amusement, are free from them. The
<lb/>reason is very obvious. In the time of Charles the Second,
<lb/>the stage, in common with every other department of art,
<lb/>was highly immoral; and religious preachers of every deno-
<lb break="no"/>mination, but mainly puritans, launched their loudest invec-
<lb break="no"/>tives against it, as well they might; and the feeling against
<lb/>the stage with us has been inherited from these puritans, and
<lb/>exists now among their descendants as rankly as with them,
<lb/>even when the cause which gave it birth has ceased to exist
<lb/>for nearly a century. None of the indecent plays of Charles
<lb/>the Second’s time have been represented in our theatres for
<lb/>fifty years past; but the literature of that period, which was
<lb/>tinctured with the same moral qualities that disgraced the
<lb/>stage, is still preserved in our libraries, and we have no
<lb/>doubt that every clergyman’s bookcase in the city contains
<lb/>more objectionable reading than is presented on the stage
<lb/>during a year. The truth is, that the greater number of act-
<lb break="no"/>ing plays are as moral and prosy as an afternoon sermon ;
<lb/>for before a play can be put upon the English stage it must
<lb/>be approved by the Chamberlain, who blots out every coarse
<lb/>expression and every scene of doubtful morality ; and as we
<lb/>produce no plays of our own, we present only those that the
<lb/>English licensers nave pronounced fit for the people.</p><p></p><p>But we still keep up the hereditary cry against the immo-
<lb break="no"/>ralities of the stage; and one state in the Union forbids by
<lb/>law any dramatic representation within her borders, when
<lb/>the stage has become almost as moral as the pulpit. In-
<lb break="no"/>deed, a good moral is an essential part of every stage perform-
<lb break="no"/>ance, without which no play can be successful. No other
<lb/>species of amusement demands this; yet the stage is still
<lb/>called immoral, religious people are forbidden to frequent the
<lb/>theatre, and only the reckless and abandoned have courage
<lb/>to visit it, and it is to suit their tastes, because they form the
<lb/>chief supporters of the stage, that the objectionable places
<lb/>which we have hinted at have an existence. But let the thea-
<lb break="no"/>tre be visited by respectable people, men of refined tastes
<lb/>and good morals, and the punch-rooms and coffee-rooms</p><p><pb n="121"/>
</p><p>would soon be abolished, and the people would have what
<lb/>they continually seek—a place of amusement where they
<lb/>might derive some moral profit, while indulging in the re-
<lb break="no"/>laxation from the cares of business which is necessary to pre-
<lb break="no"/>serve a healthy tone in the moral and physical system.</p><p></p><p>The upper classes, as the rich are called, feel the want of
<lb/>a place of public amusement, though they have a thousand
<lb/>resources which the poor lack, and they are striving to esta-
<lb break="no"/>blish an Italian opera house for their peculiar enjoyment;
<lb/>and one of our morning papers, that holds the theatre in
<lb/>such abhorrence as to exclude all dramatic advertisements
<lb/>from its columns, professes to be in ecstasies with the mea-
<lb break="no"/>sure. But the Italian opera, in its very highest condition, is
<lb/>only the recreation of Sybarites ; it appeals only to the ani-
<lb break="no"/>mal sensations, but makes no aim at the heart, which the
<lb/>lowest order of dramatic entertainments professes to do. If
<lb/>half the exertions which are bestowed in attempts to estab-j
<lb/>lish an Italian opera in this city, were made in behalf of the
<lb/>theatre to establish it on a proper basis, a place of amuse-
<lb break="no"/>ment would be furnished for the people which would be ac-
<lb break="no"/>ceptable and profitable to all classes. An Italian opera never
<lb/>can succeed in this city. If it cannot in London and Paris
<lb/>without the aid of government or government officials, how
<lb/>can it be supported here, where its patrons are fewer and its
<lb/>expenses higher ?</p><p>Horace Walpole, in one of his letters to Sir Horace Mann,
writes,—
</p><p>“ We have got another opera, which is liked; there was to have
<lb/>been a vast elephant, but the just Directors, designing to give the au-
<lb break="no"/>dience the full weight of one for their money, made it so heavy that
<lb/>at the Prova it broke through the stage. It was to have carried
<lb/>twenty soldiers, with Monticelli on a throne in the middle. There is
<lb/>a new subscription begun for next year, thirty subscribers at two hun-
<lb break="no"/>dred pounds each. Would you believe that I am one? You need not
<lb/>believe it quite, for I am but half an one ; Mr. Conway and I take a
<lb/>share between us.”</p><p></p><p>This was in the last century, to be sure, but it is by simi-
<lb break="no"/>-lar means that the Italian Opera is supported now in Lon-
<lb break="no"/>don; and unless the much talked-of “upper ten thousand’’
<lb/>are willing to subscribe in this munificent manner for the
<lb/>amusement of each other, which we doubt exceedingly, an
<lb/>Italian opera can never flourish among us.</p><p>The Fine Arts
THE PENNSYLVANIA ACADEMY OF FINE ARTS.
</p><p>Considering that this institution has only been in operation
<lb/>thirty-nine years, it has succeeded in accumulating an amount
<lb/>of bad pictures that would seem almost incredible, were it
<lb/>not that sincere conviction may be purchased for a quarter of
<lb/>a dollar. There seems to have existed a kind of chemical
<lb/>affinity, by which all the worst specimens of Art which came
<lb/>within the sphere of its attraction were drawn irresistibly
<lb/>toward it. If this hypothesis be a correct one, we can only
<lb/>wish that its power of enticement had extended to some more
<lb/>northerly cities. Institutions of this kind seem to be the
<lb/>threads around which all the bad taste hitherto held in solu-
<lb break="no"/>tion in general society hastens to crystallize itself. They
<lb/>are the ravens sent by Providence to supply mediocrity with
<lb/>bread in the shape of patronage.</p><p></p><p>We hardly know whereto begin noticing some few of
<lb/>the many atrocities perpetrated here in the holy name of
<lb/>Art; but perhaps the fairest way of settling the precedence
<lb/>will be by the amount of canvass which each artist has ex-
<lb break="no"/>pended. Perhaps, were we to take the aggregate amount
<lb/>of Mr. Sully’s canvasses, we should find that he had display-
<lb break="no"/>ed more of this liberal enthusiasm than any other gentleman
<lb/>whose “works” are here exhibited, but we doubt not but</p><p></p><p>he will be willing to yield the foremost place to Mr. West,
<lb/>both because he (Mr. W.) was president of the Royal Acad-
<lb break="no"/>emy, and because he has sacrificed by far the largest single
<lb/>canvass upon the altar of professional ambition. “ West’s
<lb/>celebrated picture of Death on the Pale Horse,” as it is
<lb/>styled in the panegyrical catalogue, is painted upon a can-
<lb break="no"/>vass twenty-five feet long by fourteen and a half feet wide,
<lb/>being almost as large as the foresail of a pilot boat, and if in
<lb/>such matters, badness may be estimated by the acre, we
<lb/>should not hesitate to pronounce it the worst picture in
<lb/>the world. It would be hard to say whether it be more
<lb/>wanting in the imaginative or the mechanical qualities of a
<lb/>true painting. In both these respects it is below criticism,
<lb/>and it were only a waste of time to point out its most striking
<lb/>absurdities. We cannot help noticing, however, the original-
<lb break="no"/>ity displayed both in the conception and execution of the flash
<lb/>of lightning in the left of the picture. The impression con-
<lb break="no"/>veyed by such electric displays to the mind of ordinary mor-
<lb break="no"/>tals, is that of extreme swiftness, but precisely the reverse
<lb/>effect seems to have been produced upon the President of a
<lb/>Royal Academy. The lightning in the present case wan-
<lb break="no"/>ders deliberately down and ends in a viscid drop, so that its
<lb/>general appearance is like what would be produced by the
<lb/>melting and running down of a ball of molasses candy which
<lb/>bad been reduced to that extremity upon a street-stall by a
<lb/>sudden change of weather. We cannot help imagining the
<lb/>exultation which must have been felt in England when this
<lb/>monstrosity was fairly rolled up and shipped to this country.
<lb/>It might almost seem that its being sent hither was the re-
<lb break="no"/>sult of a plot to give British tourists an additional subject of
<lb/>merriment. Yet this trumpery has been carte l about the
<lb/>country in every direction and exhibited, with the conni-
<lb break="no"/>vances of those who should have known better, as a miracle
<lb/>of Art. Editors of newspapers, who are supposed ex officio
<lb/>to know every thing, pay for their tickets to such sickening
<lb/>shows with half a column of flummery, and the mass of the
<lb/>people forever after use this picture as a standard in measur-
<lb break="no"/>ing other pictures which have no President's name attached
<lb/>to them. In this way incalculable injury is done to the cause
<lb/>of true Art.</p><p></p><p>Allston’s “ Dead man restored to life,” we have never been
<lb/>able to admire. It displays none of that artist’s fine qualities.
<lb/>The coloring is hard and niggardly, the grouping inefficient,
<lb/>and the whole looks more like an attempt to paint a large
<lb/>picture than a great one. Haydon's picture of “ Christ’s en-
<lb break="no"/>try into Jerusalem,” which hangs on another side of the room,
<lb/>is more in Allston’s style of coloring than his own picture. It
<lb/>is chiefly interesting for the portraits it contains. We con-
<lb break="no"/>fess that we think a great crowd of people to be hardly a fit
<lb/>subject for the painter, unless, indeed, it be at such a distance
<lb/>as to preclude any attempt at individualizing particular
<lb/>heads. If the Artist paints all the heads with equal care it
<lb/>will either seem unnatural, because the eye could not take
<lb/>them all in at one moment, as in this picture, or it will de-
<lb break="no"/>prive the figures of all motion and life. In Haydon’s pic-
<lb break="no"/>tures all the heads in the foreground look too large.</p><p></p><p>Among many pictures which are disgraceful as works of
<lb/>Art, there is one which is positively disgusting. We allude
<lb/>to No. 48 in the “ North Gallery.” The subject is stated in
<lb/>the catalogue as “ Time flogging Cupid.” It is, of course,
<lb/>by a French Artist, and, as we turned away from it, we
<lb/>could not help wishing most fervently that the mythology of
<lb/>the Greeks had made Cupid a cherub, and thus precluded
<lb/>him from becoming the subject of such an exposure.</p><p></p><p>One of the worst pictures in the exhibition is by Opie, R.
<lb/>A. The subject is from Gil Blas. If pictures may be esti-
<lb break="no"/>mated in the same way that puns were by Lamb, who con-</p><p><pb n="122" break="no" />
</p><p>sidered that badness was one of the postulates for excellence,
<lb/>this may be ranked as facile princeps in Art. If there can
<lb/>be anything worse, it must be Mr. Sully’s copy of the same
<lb/>painting. We can conceive of no object which Mr. S. could
<lb/>have had in selecting this for imitation, unless it might
<lb/>have been a desire to excuse in some measure the outrages
<lb/>of American daubers by multiplying the specimens of one
<lb/>perpetrated by an Englishman.</p><p></p><p>The Directors of the Academy have learned one artifice
<lb/>from the picture dealers, and have given to the most fla-
<lb break="no"/>grant violations of artistic proprieties the names of the dif-
<lb break="no"/>ferent Great Masters, selected apparently at random. They
<lb/>seem to have entertained a peculiar spite against Sal-
<lb break="no"/>vator Rosa, the greater number being ascribed to him.
<lb/>Time would fail us to enumerate particularly all the wretch-
<lb break="no"/>ed spoiled canvasses which the “ Academy” have sanctioned
<lb/>either by their purchase or acceptance. There are a few
<lb/>good pictures here, chiefly by Flemish artists, but a foreign
<lb/>visitor would be led to imagine that there were but two or
<lb/>three American painters, of the works of some of whom the
<lb/>Academy had succeeded in making almost complete collec-
<lb break="no"/>tions, and who compared very favorably with the great for-
<lb break="no"/>eign masters, specimens of whose productions may be found
<lb/>hung side by side with theirs. We think that Mr. Peale
<lb/>showed a truly patriotic forbearance in placing his works in
<lb/>a Museum of his own, where may be seen some ten score of
<lb/>portraits all with a dab of light like a sprinkling of flour on
<lb/>the apex of their heads. When a visitor pays his money at
<lb/>the door of that institution, he knows what he has to expect.
<lb/>If he does not like the pictures he may look at the mastodon.
<lb/>At the Academy, if the paintings are not to his taste, he may
<lb/>look at—at—at—Mr. Pettrick’s statue of Goethe’s Mephis-
<lb break="no"/>tophiles!</p><p></p><p>We have confined ourselves in this notice chiefly to the
<lb/>bad pictures in this exhibition, partly because they form by
<lb/>far the largest proportion, and partly because we think that
<lb/>most of them disgrace the walls where they hang. We are
<lb/>indignant that the public taste should continue any longer
<lb/>to be miseducated by such examples. If we are to have
<lb/>Academies of Art, let them be useful in one of two ways
<lb/>Either let them quicken the artistic perceptions of the mass
<lb/>of the people by collecting good foreign pictures, or good
<lb/>copies of them; or let them (and this is better) encourage
<lb/>American Art by purchasing and paying liberally for good
<lb/>pictures by native artists, especially if the Artists be un.
<lb/>known. Such institutions should lead the public taste in
<lb/>some measure, and the purchase of a picture by them should
<lb/>precede the verdict of popular taste, and not follow it.
<lb/>America can now point to Artists of whom Italy or Greece
<lb/>in their best days might have been proud. Why need we
<lb/>make a collection of tasteless failures with foreign names at-
<lb break="no"/>tached to them, while we might give employment and per-
<lb break="no"/>haps bread to such men as Page and Powers !</p><p></p><p>The collection of pictures we have been noticing is the
<lb/>more disgraceful to Philadelphia, because there is a great
<lb/>deal of refined taste and judgment there, as well as liberal
<lb/>and judicious patronage. The piece of statuary by Powers
<lb/>and the picture by Leutze which we mentioned in our last,
<lb/>are both for a gentleman of Philadelphia whose private
<lb/>collection is as honorable to his taste as to his munificence.</p><p>THE PARDONING GOVERNOR.
</p><p>We have often seen notices of pardons by the late Gover-
<lb break="no"/>nor of Pennsylvania, but we had no suspicion of the extent
<lb/>to which he had strained his mercy, until we saw the offi-</p><p></p><p>cial statement of the exact number of convicts whom he set
<lb/>free before their term of confinement expired. The whole
<lb/>number of pardons granted by Governor Porter is eight
<lb/>hundred, of these, fifty-five were granted before trial. Among
<lb/>the pardoned were several murderers, counterfeiters, bur-
<lb break="no"/>glars, horse thieves, bigamists, incendiaries, and fraudulent
<lb/>voters. A fearful list of freedmen. Of what use are laws
<lb/>that must be executed by lawless men ? These eight hun-
<lb break="no"/>dred rogues whom Governor Porter set free, the great part
<lb/>of them beyond doubt to rob and murder again, had been
<lb/>convicted at great expense to the state; and the neigh-
<lb break="no"/>borhoods which they had infested, had no doubt looked upon
<lb/>themselves as happily rid of dangerous members: but the
<lb/>expense must all be incurred again by the state, and throats
<lb/>must be cut, and houses fired again, because the governor,
<lb/>one weak-minded or dishonest man to whom the people gave
<lb/>power over their lives and fortunes, chose to have it so.
<lb/>Another Governor is the very opposite of Governor Porter,
<lb/>either very honest or very hard hearted, and will grant no
<lb/>pardons under any circumstances, and convicts who had
<lb/>been accidentally condemned must suffer years of confine-
<lb break="no"/>ment, because the Governor (the one man again) will have
<lb/>it so.</p><p></p><p>What absurdity to talk of justice, when the execution of
<lb/>the law depends upon the whim of an individual ! If one
<lb/>Governor may pardon eight hundred convicts, why may not
<lb/>some other Governor hereafter make a general jail delivery
<lb/>and pardon all convicts. If Governor Porter may pardon fif-
<lb break="no"/>ty-five indicted criminals before trial, what is there to pre-
<lb break="no"/>vent some other Governor releasing all offenders before trial ?
<lb/>Nothing could more plainly show the folly of the majority
<lb/>of the whole people making a law, and then giving one man
<lb/>the power to render it null, than the exposure of Governor
<lb/>Porter’s suspicious mercy. The Americans are strangely
<lb/>reckless of power: having it in their own hands, and having
<lb/>never felt the want of it themselves, nor suffered much from
<lb/>its abuse by others, they give it away as though it were
<lb/>little worth. They give it to their rulers as though their
<lb/>rulers were angels, and could not use it improperly. They
<lb/>are credulous to a degree passing belief. It never seems to
<lb/>have occurred to the people of the United States, that their
<lb/>executive officers could do wrong ; to think so would be a re-
<lb break="no"/>flection upon the people themselves, for the officers, are they
<lb/>not taken from the people? But the conduct of Governor
<lb/>Porter of Pennsylvania has caused a suspicion in some minds
<lb/>that the State Executive enjoys too much power, and a
<lb/>proposition has already been introduced into the Pennsylva-
<lb break="no"/>nia legislature requiring the consent of the Senate to a par-
<lb break="no"/>don by the Governor. In the most democratic state in the
<lb/>Union, Massachusetts, the advice and consent of the Gover-
<lb break="no"/>nor’s council is necessary to a pardon.</p><p></p><p>Governor Porter must be a singularly weak-headed man,
<lb/>or the courts in Pennsylvania must be strangely corrupt, to
<lb/>allow of eight hundred men being sent wrongfully to prison.
<lb/>We flatter ourselves that we are governed by our own laws,
<lb/>but we are mainly governed by the whims of one man to
<lb/>whom we give power to render null and void all our laws.
<lb/>An elective monarchy is certainly an improvement upon an
<lb/>hereditary monarchy, but it is only an improvement, and a
<lb/>slight one too ; our people are almost as far from believing
<lb/>that all power rests with them, and that they have pow-
<lb break="no"/>er to govern themselves, as the subjects of Nicholas or
<lb/>Queen Victoria.</p><p></p><p>We do not condemn governor Porter; he may have been
<lb/>moved by merciful considerations in setting the rogues free
<lb/>that the court had condemned to imprisonment; but he or
<lb/>the judiciary of the state must have been strangely want-
<lb break="no"/>ing in honesty or capacity, or so great a number of men
<lb/>c[o]uld not have been convicted unjustly, or unjustly set
<lb/>set at liberty.</p><p><pb n="123"/>
Original Poetry.
GABRIELLE.
How I loved thee, dearly loved thee,
None can tell,
But the heart that still adores thee,
Gabrielle!
Thou hast left me, ay deceived me,
Know I well;
But I never can forget thee,
Gabrielle.
In the quiet midnight hour
Thou art nigh :
In my dreams thy gentle power
Flitteth by:
</p><p>And upon my fevered brain
<lb/>Thy holy spell
<lb/>Cometh like an olden strain
<lb/>We loved so well.</p><p>Though unknown and unregretted
I may fade,
I shall never cease to love thee,
Faithless maid;
For my pathway, lone and dreary,
Through life’s cell,
By thy smile was made leas dreary,
Gabrielle.
On my grave, when I am gone,
Drop a tear
</p><p>For the heart with anguish torn
<lb/>Now with’ring here;
<lb/>When departed, think of him
<lb/>Who loved so well,</p><p>And if then thine eyes should dim,
Gabrielle ?
For that tear thy spirit lover,
Fleet and fast,
Round thy footsteps e’er shall hover
Till the last;
And with music’s sweetest numbers,
Holy swell:
Angels bright shall guard thy slumbers,
Gabrielle.

THE WIFE OF LOT.
“ And the sun was risen upon the earth when Lot entered Zoar.	
“ But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pil-
lar of salt.
Genesis.
“ Arise, and flee hence, and turn not back !”
The angel to the godly patriarch said—
“ Tarry thou not for kindred, herd, nor flock !"
And Lot arose and forth the city fled
Onward to Zoar. And clinging to his side
Were they on whom as yet no blemish lay,
And the true wife—the true, and oh ! how tried !
With lingering footstep followed on the way.
</p><p>Alas for her, sad mother ! whose torn heart
<lb/>Felt love’s strong chain to these her being bind;
<lb/>Yet clave to them, her being’s other part—</p><p>To them, the doomed, that she had left behind.
</p><p>And Lot sped onward, while the sandy plain
<lb/>Gleam’d ’neath their hurrying feet. But Zarah turned—
<lb/>And lo! on Sodom fell the fiery rain,</p><p>And the far mountains heaved, and wildly burned,
</p><p>And from their summits fiercely hurled their blaze,
<lb/>As hurls high Jove his thunderbolts in ire;
<lb/>Lighting the roofs, till ’neath her frenzied gaze
<lb/>The city flamed like one vast funeral pyre.</p><p>And oh ! the agony that rent her breast,
While from her eyes the heart’s warm torrent burst—
To know the forms her arms maternal pressed,
Were ashes there beneath yon pile accursed.
“ Alas !” she wildly cried, “ here would I die!
Mine eyes may look no more on all I cherish!
Too much for life henceforth were memory !
Since they are saved, with these, oh ! let me perish !''
</p><p>Oh ! mourning mother! long upon the plain
<lb/>She stood—her watch in tearful anguish keeping;
<lb/>Till the warm blood congealed within each vein,
<lb/>And all to stone she turned with bitter weeping.</p><p>MARY E. HEWITT.
THE LECTURE ROOM.
MR. HUDSON'S LECTURE ON HAMLET.
</p><p>The new lecturer on Shakspeare had been gazetted from
<lb/>Boston as something of a lion, in which respect we cannot
<lb/>help considering that he had been very ill classified. His
<lb/>eye, manner, eagerness, and especially the avidity with
<lb/>which he pounces upon a truth as if he would tear out the
<lb/>very heart of the mystery, characterize him as belonging to
<lb/>the ornithological part of creation—a hawk or vulture, rather
<lb/>than a lion. He has none of the paces of the lion, nothing
<lb/>of the roar loud and continuous, or low and dulcet—for your
<lb/>lion, your literary lion, as wisely remarked by Bottom, is very
<lb/>apt to degenerate into the sucking dove.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Hudson was expected to make a sensation. He had
<lb/>made a sensation in Boston—would the canes and gloves of
<lb/>New York respond? This is, as a question, by no means
<lb/>necessarily to be answered in the affirmative. Civilization
<lb/>and intelligence, we are told, are always proportioned to the
<lb/>density of the population, and New York being huge and
<lb/>metropolitan, it must be considered that what is a thirty-two
<lb/>pounder in the provinces is a mere pop-gun here, by the sheer
<lb/>force of mathematical accumulation. Hence it follows that
<lb/>New York can bear a celebrity from any other part of the
<lb/>country, with great equanimity, while the reverse movement
<lb/>has frequently called to mind the frog in the fable. What-
<lb break="no"/>ever Mr. Hudson maybe elsewhere, in New York he is
<lb/>simply a man, a cultivated man, originally of strong mind
<lb/>and vigorous perception, with these rare natural faculties
<lb/>strengthened by judicious reading. Here let him appear
<lb/>what he is, and he will be welcome. Anything extrinsic is
<lb/>“ leather and prunella.” There are one or two points of
<lb/>manner about Mr. Hudson that, we might as well state it at
<lb/>once, however telling they may be elsewhere, can be dis-
<lb break="no"/>pensed with to advantage here. Such are some of the un-
<lb break="no"/>utterable chokings, the ineffable grins, and the foolish apolo-
<lb break="no"/>gy which preceded the lecture. His own laugh at one
<lb/>point betrayed him—at a peculiarly abdominal utterance of
<lb/>the word practical, during which he tied up his own muscles
<lb/>to relax those of the company. If the thing is to be done in
<lb/>this way, let it be so advertised. Shakspeare through a horse
<lb/>collar might draw upon the Park audiences, but the divines,
<lb/>the lawyers, the literateurs, who graced the Society Library
<lb/>on Monday evening, can dispense with the wrigglings and
<lb/>grins with which Mr. Hudson, like the early Methodists, de-
<lb break="no"/>livers his conceptions. We are not at all disparaging Mr.
<lb/>Hudson, which we should be, on the contrary, if we took
<lb/>these painful and ludicrous twistings for any thing natural or
<lb/>harmonious with the mind within.</p><p></p><p>In our view of a lecture on Shakspeare, we are about to pay
<lb/>Mr. Hudson a high and deserved compliment, by saying that
<lb/>his lecture, in tone and thought, might have been written by</p><p><pb n="124"/>
</p><p>the poet Dana. There was the same inward depth and com-
<lb break="no"/>mand of the outer world, the same profound constructiveness
<lb/>and freedom from mere dogmatism. The separate thoughts
<lb/>may not have been original—that is, uttered for the first time,
<lb/>a very shabby definition of originality, by the way) but there
<lb/>was the innate strength of mind to grasp and mould them
<lb/>into one consistent whole. The thinking was of the right j
<lb/>manly sort, stopping at no half-way house of decencies, but
<lb/>going forth right to the end of the journey, fall who might
<lb/>by the way. Many a bleeding victim was left by Mr. Hud-
<lb break="no"/>son prostrate on the path. Poor Dr. Paley with his plausi-
<lb break="no"/>ble morals, an army of pretenders, who seem rather than are,
<lb/>and a score of politicians. The latter received their death
<lb/>wound from a gun resting on the shoulder of Polonius. We
<lb/>shall not readily forget the miserable demagogue whose
<lb/>secret is to find out the tendencies of the mass, and put him-
<lb break="no"/>self in the van—“ a trick requiring only long legs, a short
<lb/>head, and no heart at all." This was one of Mr. Hudson’s
<lb/>points which told well, and by the way, seeing how much
<lb/>he himself gains from this harmless stage effect, he might
<lb/>have spared the poor actors the gird he put in, in the Ophe-
<lb break="no"/>lia scene—other sayings were as good, but the rapid succes-
<lb break="no"/>sion of short, close, sinewy sentences, have driven them from
<lb/>our memory. We remember one happy illustration, refer-
<lb break="no"/>ring to the noisy pretenders, and the silence of true greatness.
<lb/>“We hear the crackling of burning straw, but not the rays
<lb/>of the sun in heaven." These are words that savor not at
<lb/>all of the mountebank. The pointed antithetical character
<lb/>of the politician, would have done honor to Butler and the
<lb/>best of the old Character Writers. The analysis of the cha- J
<lb/>racter of Hamlet was ingenious, and if not convincing, it was
<lb/>at least well defended by a numerous light infantry of brilliant i
<lb/>truths. The ground taken was that Hamlet feigned insanity,
<lb/>and so closely that he was subject to all the laws of the real
<lb/>melancholy. The most that can be done with Hamlet is to 
<lb/>take some theory as a nucleus, like the thread of the sugar
<lb/>manufacturer, for the crystallization of a whole world of
<lb/>truth and philosophy. The sarcasm with which that “code
<lb/>of Chesterfieldianism,” the instructions to 1-aertes, was top-
<lb break="no"/>pled over, was righteously expended, and the depth of feeling
<lb/>for Ophelia, was an earnest to us of what we may expect in 
<lb/>the lecturer's development of the great Shakspearian female
<lb/>life.</p><p>THE CONCERT ROOM.
</p><p>“ Musical Criticism.”—Under this head, the editor of the 
<lb/>Evening Mirror, comments with much indignation upon
<lb/>some remarks made by us a week or two ago, upon a young
<lb/>vocalist: he also informs us that we have been most shock-
<lb break="no"/>ingly mangled by the Brooklyn Daily Advertiser. Now 
<lb/>this we are really sorry for, as we both respect and esteem
<lb/>its excellent editor, Dr. Northall, for many reasons.</p><p></p><p>We have not seen his remarks, but we are acquainted
<lb/>with their import, and we feel ourselves compelled to say,
<lb/>that considering the very near relationship in which the
<lb/>doctor stands to the young lady in question, those remarks,
<lb/>though perfectly natural, were impolitic and in bad taste.</p><p></p><p>In answer to the editor of the Mirror, we must reiterate
<lb/>what we have before said, that his musical opinions are of
<lb/>no value; they would not even serve as make weight to a
<lb/>doubting mind. His criticisms, as criticisms, are without
<lb/>meaning: being a mere string of strained similies, far-fetch-
<lb break="no"/>ed images, irrelevant rhapsodies, which, though expressed
<lb/>by a strange mixture of quaintness and bombast, flippancy
<lb/>and earnestness, bear no internal evidence that they spring</p><p>either from a knowledge or a love of the subject in discus-
sion.
</p><p>The editor of the Mirror has earned, by his after supper
<lb/>lucubrations, the honorable title of Operatic Puffer; he has
<lb/>worked hard for the distinction and has justly gained it, but
<lb/>what benefit his labors have conferred upon the cause of
<lb/>music it would be impossible to discover. He has endea-
<lb break="no"/>vored to foster a false standard of taste, by exalting (O pow-
<lb break="no"/>er of imagination !) merely good talent into superior genius ;
<lb/>he has encouraged negligence and slovenliness in every de-
<lb break="no"/>partment, by indiscriminate commendation. This may be
<lb/>called good nature, but it is not justice, and such a course
<lb/>of conduct cannot command the respect of any one.</p><p></p><p>Our course must of necessity be entirely opposite to this.
<lb/>We do not write to elevate the individual at the expense of
<lb/>the Art, but we are striving to raise the Art by preserving
<lb/>it and its professors in a course of integrity.</p><p></p><p>Our remarks upon Miss Northall, are designated by the
<lb/>editor of the Mirror, as injudicious, flippant, and ill-natured.
<lb/>This is a charge he is by no means justified in making. We
<lb/>might, with equal justice, accuse him of dishonorable mo-
<lb break="no"/>tives in writing up Pico at the expense of Borghese ; or we
<lb/>might say that he puffed up the Opera concern, day after
<lb/>day, for the sole purpose of gaining the artists’ gratuitous
<lb/>services at a “ complimentary concert.” We do not say this,
<lb/>but he has given us a right to do so, by wilfully misconstru-
<lb break="no"/>ing our intentions. We have done him the justice to be-
<lb break="no"/>lieve him honest in his intentions, and we have a right to
<lb/>expect the same consideration from him.</p><p></p><p>We have always endeavored to assist the young, but we
<lb/>conscientiously believe, that confirming them in their faults,
<lb/>whatever they may be, by indiscriminate and fulsome flat-
<lb break="no"/>tery, such as “ one of a brilliant constellation of talent,” &amp;c.,
<lb/>&amp;c., is not an act of friendship, but on the contrary, an un-
<lb break="no"/>kind and wilful deviation from the truth, entailing upon the
<lb/>author well merited contempt for his mendacity, and upon
<lb/>the subject, a long account of falsely raised expectations, and
<lb/>a sad history of blighted hopes. Under this conviction, we
<lb/>have chosen the sterner course ; we may wound and offend
<lb/>—though never intentionally, at first, but we shall soon be
<lb/>understood, and we do not fear the result.</p><p></p><p>Gratuitous Services at Charitable Concerts.—We
<lb/>have neither space nor time this week, to enter upon this
<lb/>subject as largely as we could wish. We will simply define
<lb/>the duty the professor owes to the public, when once his
<lb/>name is announced in the bills as a gratuitous performer.
<lb/>Having allowed the beneficiary the attraction of his name
<lb/>(however small that attraction may prove to be) he should
<lb/>consider that he has made an engagement which he is bound
<lb/>in honor to fulfil, not only to the letter, but in the spirit.
<lb/>How very rarely such obligations are observed, we well
<lb/>know. We will mention two of recent occurrence, illustra-
<lb break="no"/>ting forcibly how the letter and the spirit of such engage-
<lb break="no"/>ments are observed.</p><p></p><p>At the benefit concert at the Transfiguration Church,
<lb/>Madame Pico was announced to sing. She did not appear.
<lb/>What was to compensate for the absence of the chief attrac-
<lb break="no"/>tion? Was not this violating the letter of the engagement.
<lb/>A most exquisite septett by Hummel was to be performed,
<lb/>Mr. W. A. King taking the piano-forte. Mr. King could get
<lb/>no perfect rehearsal of the piece, but he was assured that
<lb/>the persons appointed to play it, had played it frequently
<lb/>before. He was compelled to be satisfied. In the evening,
<lb/>when the time came for its performance, there was no one
<lb/>to play the horn part. There were two horn players pre-</p><p><pb n="125" break="no" />
</p><p>sent, Messrs. Whoening and Nidds, both efficient, we sup-
<lb break="no"/>pose, or their reputation is false. They both refused stea-
<lb break="no"/>dily, the former, mark this well! knowing it well, having
<lb/>played it before, and seemed quite indifferent to the painful
<lb/>situation in which Mr. King was placed. All this time the
<lb/>Director was hurrying the performance on, saying in an au-
<lb break="no"/>dible voice, “ go on, go on—never mind, play it without the
<lb/>horn,—we can’t stay here all night.” Mr. King, however,
<lb/>very justly refused, and finally Mr. Groenvelt, much to his
<lb/>honor as a man and a musician, undertook to play as much
<lb/>of the horn part as possible upon the clarionette. The piece
<lb/>was hurried on by the conductor, Signor Rapetti, in a very
<lb/>indecent manner, his impatience to retire being evident to
<lb/>the audience. The septett was beautifully played, under all
<lb/>these disadvantages, and was beyond a doubt the only wor-
<lb break="no"/>thy performance of the evening. Even if the gentlemen
<lb/>hornplayers were not engaged to play in the septett, under
<lb/>the circumstances, their feelings both as men and as musi-
<lb break="no"/>cians should have induced them, for the honor of their art,
<lb/>to afford their necessary aid. But to some men art has no
<lb/>other signification than cash.</p><p>The violation of the spirit of the agreement rests either
with the performers or the conductor.
</p><p>The second instance occurred only last Saturday evening,
<lb/>at the Benefit Concert of the Italian Opera. After allowing
<lb/>the names to appear in the advertisements, in the large pos-
<lb break="no"/>ters and small programmes, (a cheap way to gain notoriety)
<lb/>when the audience was assembled, excuses were sent from
<lb/>Madame Arnoult, Miss Northall, Signor De Begnis and Val-
<lb break="no"/>tellina. Being in fact the sum total of the “ brilliant constel-
<lb break="no"/>lation,” as the Mirror would say. These excuses were re-
<lb break="no"/>ceived by the audience with derision and contempt as they
<lb/>deserved, and we should be glad if the public would mark their
<lb/>just disgust at such conduct upon their next public perform-
<lb break="no"/>ance.</p><p></p><p>Madame Otto, Miss De Luce, and a Miss Sobienski, and
<lb/>Signor Sanquirico, appeared, we understand, but of their
<lb/>performances we cannot speak, as the customary compliment
<lb/>of tickets was withheld from us.</p><p>The Drama.
</p><p>Olympic Theatre.—A new Burlesque, entitled “ Joe Mil-
<lb break="no"/>ler and his men,” was produced at this theatre last week. It is a tra-
<lb break="no"/>vestie upon the celebrated melo-drama of the Miller and his Men.
<lb/>The incidents are identically the same, but the dialogue is done into
<lb/>doggrel, full of point, wit, and humor. The actors throughout make
<lb/>a signal failure in their conception of the ger us of burlesque. Instead
<lb/>of acting burlesque with an intensity of seriousness, and thus height-
<lb break="no"/>ening the absurdity, they render nonsense still more nonsensical, and
<lb/>thus miss the point entirely.</p><p></p><p>The scenery throughout the evening was extremely beautiful. Mr.
<lb/>Bengough has the eye and the feeling of a true artist, with an admira-
<lb break="no"/>ble power of elaborating his ideas. The piece was of course put upon
<lb/>the stage in excellent style, but it will not succeed.</p><p></p><p>The Leader of the Orchestra should content himself with playing
<lb/>the music set down for him, and cease indulging in such very ques-
<lb break="no"/>tionable "fun.”</p><p></p><p>Chatham Theatre.—This establishment re-opened on
<lb/>Monday last. During the recess it has been entirely repainted, newly
<lb/>decorated, and a new stage has also been laid down. It is now, cer-
<lb break="no"/>tainly, the most elegant theatre in the city.</p><p></p><p>We hate imposition in every way—playing an old piece (the Va-
<lb break="no"/>grant) with a new name, is a gross imposition. “True Blue” is a
<lb/>nautical, patriotic, not-to-be-believed drama, Americanised from the
<lb/>English, in which one Yankee tar does battle with an incalculable
<lb/>number of Britishers, and whips them all to nothing. Sundry very
<lb/>equivocal speeches are made, which had much better be omitted.</p><p>Mr. Freer is not at home as the Sailor. Mr. Winans is very droll,
but somewhat too broad in his acting. Miss Orville, who has a tine
</p><p>voice and is an elegant dresser, was encored in a very pretty song,
<lb/>“ When the moon on the lake is beaming,” and received a shower of
<lb/>bouquets from her admirers.</p><p>“ The Devil in Paris” is postponed for the present.
NEW ILLUSTRATED WORKS.
</p><p>The Devotional Family Bible, by the Rev. Alexander Fletcher, A. M., au-
<lb break="no"/>thor of the Guide to Family Devotion, Scripture History, &amp;c., containing
<lb/>the Old and New Testaments, with explanatory notes, practical observa-
<lb break="no"/>tions, copious marginal references, &amp;c., every part embellished with a highly
<lb/>finished engraving on steel, including views of the principal ; laces men-
<lb break="no"/>tioned in Scripture, from drawings taken on the spot. New York, R. Mar-
<lb break="no"/>tin A Co., 26 John street. Part 1st. Price 25 cents.</p><p></p><p>We believe this to be the cheapest and most elegant edition of the
<lb/>Bible which has been published in this country. The paper and letter-
<lb break="no"/>press are both of the highest order, and the embellishments, though
<lb/>copied from pictures which are almost universally known, are execu-
<lb break="no"/>ted in a style of art to make them acceptable, even to those who al-
<lb break="no"/>ready possess copies of them from other sources. The view's to be
<lb/>given in future numbers, from drawings by Catherwood and Bartlett,
<lb/>will constitute the chief pictorial value of this splendid edition of the
<lb/>Bible. We have always regarded any efforts of the imagination,
<lb/>whether executed by the pen or pencil, as sadly out of place on the
<lb/>page of Holy Writ, and we should, therefore, look with as little favor
<lb/>upon the Moses, by Sir Joshua Reynolds, in this initial number, as up-
<lb break="no"/>on the devotional reflections appended to each page, by the Reverend
<lb/>editor. The majority of Bible readers think differently, we believe,
<lb/>and to them the reflections and the embellishments of this edition, will
<lb/>be alike acceptable, while the real illustrations, the actual views of
<lb/>Bible-places, will be acceptable to all. Our remarks are intended to
<lb/>apply solely to the principle of Scriptural illustrations, and not to the
<lb/>merits of those referred to, which are of the highest excellence per se,
<lb/>and quite beyond the reach of criticism at this day.</p><p></p><p>We cannot claim any particular national credit for the excellence of
<lb/>this work, for the greater part of it is of foreign manufacture. It is
<lb/>not, however, a whit the less valuable on that account. The paper is
<lb/>manufactured in this country, expressly for the work, and several of
<lb/>the forth-coming designs will be from the burin of Smillie, who stands
<lb/>at the very head of landscape engravers of the present day. Alto-
<lb break="no"/>gether, it is a work of great beauty, and we trust that the enterprising
<lb/>publishers will find a profitable sale for it, as we have little doubt of
<lb/>their doing.</p><p></p><p>The Apocrypha, we understand, will be published in a separate

A Reply to past or the Bishop's Statement. By John Jay, one of the
counsel originally employed by the presenting Bishops. Stanford &amp;
Swords, 139 Broadway.
</p><p>We have no expectation that Mr. Jay’s pamphlet will be the last
<lb/>which the unhappy trial of Bishop Onderdonk will call forth, but it is
<lb/>the last one that we shall notice in our Journal. The Bishop and his
<lb/>friends appear to have acted with little wisdom In giving notoriety to
<lb/>the particulars of his singular case. It is greatly to be lamented that
<lb/>the public mind should have been so disturbed by the controversies
<lb/>growing out of this trial; it was a matter which concerned the Epis-
<lb break="no"/>copal Church alone, and the seemingly deep interest which the public
<lb/>have evinced in regard to it, arises from a pure love of gossip, height-
<lb break="no"/>ened by the supposed immoralities which were to be revealed. The
<lb/>harm done to the community by filling the minds of the young with
<lb/>filthy details of scandalous transactions, and exciting their passions
<lb/>by the bitter personalities of men who are looked upon as heralds of
<lb/>peace, is greater, we fear, than the good which many Bishops will
<lb/>be likely to effect in many years.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Jay’s pamphlet was called out by a rather direct insinuation
<lb/>against him, in one of the Bishop’s communications to the public,
<lb/>which he could not well let go unnoticed. His reply is temperate, re-
<lb break="no"/>spectful and dignified. He has certainly succeeded in freeing him-
<lb break="no"/>self from any charge of improper conduct or motives in the part he
<lb/>took towards procuring the presentment of the Bishop ; or in procur-
<lb break="no"/>ing witnesses after the presentment had been made. It seems to be
<lb/>a difficult matter, according to Mr. Jay’s Statement, to please the
<lb/>Bishop and his friends. They complain as loudly against those who
<lb/>neglected to make charges against him as against those who did.
<lb/>Considering Use vantage ground which Mr. Jay occupies, we cannot</p><p><pb n="126"/>
</p><p>but commend the forbearance and christianlike spirit which induced
<lb/>the exceedingly moderate and forgiving tone of his reply. It would
<lb/>have been better for all parties, if all who have felt themselves
<lb/>bound to come before the public with their views and facts had mani-
<lb break="no"/>ested the same spirit.</p><p>The Age. A Satire pronounced as a Valedictory Poem before the New York
Society of Literature, at its Second Anniversary, January 23, 1845. By
Alfred Wheeler. C. Shepard, 191 Broadway.
</p><p>" In presenting the following Poem,” says Mr. Wheeler in his pre-
<lb break="no"/>face, “ the author regrets that neither time nor opportunity has been
<lb/>afforded for such corrections and additions as would, in his humble
<lb/>judgment, add much to its merit.” Mr. Wheeler has done himself an
<lb/>injustice by putting forth his Satire without first making the additions
<lb/>hinted at, for which, we suppose, the " New York Society of Litera
<lb/>ture” must be held accountable. All the satirical parts of Mr. Whee-
<lb break="no"/>ler’s “ Satire” appear to have been left out, for we have not been able
<lb/>to discover anything that bears a resemblance to satire in a very care-
<lb break="no"/>ful reading which we gave it; and the "personal friends” who urged
<lb/>its publication before the necessary additions could be made which its
<lb/>title calls for, showed but little discretion in their friendship for the
<lb/>satirist. The freedom of the press has put an end to satire. When
<lb/>men have the privilege to abuse wrong-doers in plain prose, there is
<lb/>no inducement to insinuate abuse against them under the cover of as-
<lb break="no"/>sumed names in rhyme. The open blackguardism in which editors of
<lb/>newspapers and their correspondents indulge, makes all satire in
<lb/>rhyme appear extremely weak and unpalatable. But the vices of the
<lb/>age which are every day held up to derision in all manner of ways,
<lb/>cannot possess much zest when slightly alluded to in ten-syllable ver-
<lb break="no"/>ses, after the manner of the satirists of the last century.</p><p>Mr. Wheeler satirizes the stage in the following verses, which we
extract as a specimen of his manner :
" Now turn we, in our plaudits of the age,
To scan the beauties of the modern stage.
I mean not living beauties, who amuse
Themselves and us with powder, chalk, and rouge;
But the refinement and legitimacy
Which make the drama now so rich and racy.
Time was when men of genius there were needed,
To act the parts which else would pass unheeded ;
But now, ’twill answer if they’re almost fools—
Besides, they make the most efficient tools.
Thus tragedy and comedy are scarce,
For both are blended in the vulgar farce;
And once, ’twas thought, that they who judged the play,
Around the boxes sat in bright array—
That honor we’ve accorded to the pit,
With whom all jest and bombast pass for wit;
And as they like the mimic rage or tears,
So they reward with hisses or with cheers.
The best of every play is never seen—
That which is hid from us behind the screen ;
When Hamlet and the Ghost sit tete-a tete,
Or Richard dead becomes intemperate;
Or when Othello rants at Desdemona
Because she didn’t die the way he’d shown her.”
It is some time since we read the Rosciad, but we think we may
safely aver that it contains nothing like this.
</p><p>The "New York Society of Literature” has made us acquainted
<lb/>with this new satirist, and the satirist has introduced us for the first
<lb/>time to an acquaintance with the "New York Society of Literature.”
<lb/>We shall of course hear from the society and the satirist again.</p><p>My own Story; or the Autobiography of a Child. By Mary Howltt. D. Ap-
pleton &amp; Co., 200 Broadway.
</p><p>This volume completes the series of “ Tales for the People and
<lb/>their Children,” written by Mrs. Howitt. It is womanly, gentle, and
<lb/>gossipping; full of little pathetic episodes, and sketches of in-door
<lb/>humble life. Those who have read the other books of the series, will
<lb/>of course read this ; and in reading it will hardly fail to derive as
<lb/>much profit and enjoyment as the others have imparted.</p><p>The Columbian Lady's and Gentleman's Magazine for March. Israel Post,
3 Astor House.
</p><p>The pictorial illustrations of this number of the Columbian arc a
<lb/>mezzotint by Sadd, from Hilton’s picture of the Raising of Lazarus,
<lb/>and a line engraving by Jewett and Rolph, from a design by J. L.
<lb/>Morton of General Putnam’s Escape at Horse Neck. There is a plate
<lb/>of ladies' fashions for March, neatly colored, which we suppose is not
<lb/>considered an illustration, it being chiefly valuable for the informa-
<lb break="no"/>tion it contains, and not for any novel ideas on the aesthetics of dress.
<lb/>One of the best papers in the Magazine is by Mr. Tuckerman, form-
<lb break="no"/>ing No. 5 of a series called “ Thoughts on the Poets.” The subject of
<lb/>the present paper is Gray, for whom Mr. Tuckerman evinces a strong
<lb/>fellow-feeling, and a very thorough appreciation of his character and
<lb/>genius.</p><p>Dunigan's Illustrated Edition of the Holy Bible, according to the Douay and
Rheimish Versions.
</p><p>Nos. 21, 22, and 23, of this finely illustrated edition of the Roman
<lb/>Catholic version of the Scriptures, contain three elegantly designed
<lb/>and engraved family records for births, deaths, and marriages. The
<lb/>scroll work shows a better taste and a higher degree of knowledge in
<lb/>this kind of design, than we have before seen in an American publi-
<lb break="no"/>cation.</p><p>Observations on the best means of Presesrving the Teeth. By M. Levett,
Dentist, 264 Broadway.
A neat little pamphlet, with very plain and simple directions for
keeping the teeth in order.
The Brigand. By G. P. R. James, Farmer and Daggers, 30 Ann st.
</p><p>This, we believe, is Cour de Leon, one of Mr. James’s popular no-
<lb break="no"/>vels ; it will probably be found quite equal, under its new title, to a
<lb/>new novel by the same author.</p><p>Twenty-Fourth Annual Report or the Bloomingdale Asylum
for the Insane, for the year 1845.
</p><p>The condition of the inmates of this well known Institution are so
<lb/>pleasantly set forth in this report, that the term unfortunate hardly
<lb/>seems applicable to them. The following short extract in regard
<lb/>to their social condition at the Asylum sounds very unlike an account
<lb/>of the insane.</p><p></p><p>“ On one evening of each week a party assembles in the family par-
<lb break="no"/>lor, for the purpose of social intercourse. The officers and from fifteen
<lb/>to twenty of the patients, both ladies and gentlemen, are generally
<lb/>present. The ordinary refreshments of evening parties, are served on
<lb/>these occasions. Balls are occasionally given, at which a greater
<lb/>number of the patients assemble than at the parties. At the last en-
<lb break="no"/>tertainment of this description there were about thirty of each sex,
<lb/>which does not materially differ from the number ordinarily in atten-
<lb break="no"/>dance. The festivities ot the evening afforded very general satisfac-
<lb break="no"/>tion. There was cheerfulness wiihout extreme hilarity, gaiety with-
<lb break="no"/>out boisterousness, and a pervading disposition to participate in the
<lb/>enjoyment—to please and to be pleased.</p><p>MUSICAL INTELLIGENCE.
</p><p>We call the attention of our readers to the advertisement
<lb/>of Mr. George Loder's Grand Classical Concert, which takes place at
<lb/>the Apollo Saloon this evening, Feb. 22d. It will be without doubt
<lb/>the finest concert of the season, and every lover of music should con-
<lb break="no"/>sider it a duty to attend.</p><p></p><p>A host of talent is at present in New Orleans. Ole Bull,
<lb/>the Seguins, Frazer, with Van Praag, Borghese, and Perozzi, Henry
<lb/>Phillips, the Slomans, And a Madame Hammerskold (who both as pi-
<lb break="no"/>anist and vocalist is spoken of by the New Orleans papers at some-
<lb break="no"/>thing very great), and some others.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Henry Phillips is said to have made a very profitable
<lb/>speculation of hit tour through the States. He will return here in the
<lb/>spring, give a few concerts, perhaps, and return to England to be pre-
<lb break="no"/>sent at the various Grand Musical Festivals, which would all be im-
<lb break="no"/>perfect without him.</p><p></p><p>We have one item of news which will, we are sure, be
<lb/>highly acceptable to our musical friends. The French Opera will be
<lb/>here about July. That most charming person and sweet singer, Ma-
<lb break="no"/>demoiselle Calve, will be the leading vocalist. Grand Opera will be
<lb/>performed, such as Meyerbeer’s Robert le Diable, Les Huguenots,
<lb/>Auber’s Gustave, Herold’s Zampa, &amp;c. &amp;c. It is, however, said, and
<lb/>we regret to hear it, that Mons. and Madame Lecourt will not be of
<lb/>the company. We may be able to report something more definite in
<lb/>a week or two. The performance will be, we believe, at the Park
<lb/>theatre.</p><p>THE BROADWAY CARNIVAL.
</p><p>During the last week this famous thoroughfare presented an ap-
<lb break="no"/>pearance of gaiety, which few streets in any city of the world could
<lb/>have equalled. If Boz had been looking from the windows of the
<lb/>Carlton House, he would have received a very different impression of
<lb/>the Broadway temperament, from what he did when he made his
<lb/>notes in regard to that avenue. He would have had no occasion to
<lb/>lament the absence of organ grinders or ballad singers, for his ears
<lb/>would have been filled with the merriest chimes of bells that he ever
<lb/>listened to. The bells that clanged in the ears of Toby Veck were</p><p><pb n="127"/>
</p><p>dumb bells, compared with the lively jingling little rattlers that filled
<lb/>the air with music in Broadway, the last week. All the world, but
<lb/>especially the dressed-up part of it, the women and children, treated
<lb/>itself to a sleigh ride. Why should it not? It was less expen-
<lb break="no"/>sive than walking. A glorious ride in a scarlet sleigh, emblazoned
<lb/>with fanciful devices, covered with buffalo robes and drawn by twenty
<lb/>milk-white horses, each one wearing gay trappingc of little bells, cost
<lb/>only sixpence. Whole shoals of infants and nursery maids dashed
<lb/>along in the highest glee, shouting and clapping their hands from the
<lb/>very farthest verge of up-towndom, somewhere in the neighborhood
<lb/>of the Croton reservoir, down to the bowling-green, where they were
<lb/>whirled round in a style to break the heart of a Jehu lor envy. The
<lb/>sleighing was not only very fine, and the weather very tempting, but
<lb/>people knew that it was the last for the season, and so they went to
<lb/>work to make the most of it; and really we cannot conceive how more
<lb/>could have been made out of it.</p><p></p><p>Where all the bells came from, all the fine sleighs, all the buffalo
<lb/>robes, all the prancing horses, all the fine ladies, all the feathers, all
<lb/>the satins, all the red-cheeked children, all the pretty nurses, all the
<lb/>laughter, the good humor, the sunshine, the men, the bustle, and the
<lb/>merriment, we cannot pretend to guess. In the dull month of Febru-
<lb break="no"/>ary, they were miraculous. Let no foreign traveller ever give his im-
<lb break="no"/>pressions of New York, until he has seen sleighing in Broadway.
<lb/>There is nothing like it for fun and jollity in the world. The Carnival
<lb/>is a Connecticut fast-day in comparison,</p><p></p><p>Notices to Readers and Correspondents.— We have the pleasure
<lb/>of announcing to our readers, that hereafter, Edgar A. Poe and Henry
<lb/>C. Watson, will be associated with the Editorial department of our Jour-
<lb break="no"/>nal. Mr. Watson, will have entire control of the Musical department
<lb/>of the paper, and will give to it the full benefit of his well known abilities.</p><p></p><p>The illustration which we had intended for this week’s paper, a highly
<lb/>popular subject, which would have pleased all, and offended none, unfor-
<lb break="no"/>tunately was spoiled in the cutting, and we have none other to take the
<lb/>place which we had intended it should occupy. We shall guurd against
<lb/>such accidents in future.</p><p></p><p>A very good natured gentleman, an editor himself, called at our office to
<lb/>tell Mr. Bisco, that he thought we had faults. We have not heard of a
<lb/>more sensible thing since we commenced our editorial career. To relieve
<lb/>this gentleman’s mind from any anxious doubts that he may entertain in
<lb/>regard to our perfections, we hasten to assure him that we have faults,
<lb/>very great ones too, which he has probably never discovered, though we
<lb/>endeavor to hide them, so that others shall not see them. This may be
<lb/>hypocrisy, but we believe that this gentleman considered it a fault in us,
<lb/>that we find fault with others. This would be a very serious fault if it
<lb/>were done in mere wantonness, or from ill nature, but when fault is
<lb/>found professionally, there should be no more blame attached to the finder,
<lb/>than to a physician who informs a patient that his liver is diseased. We
<lb/>have never troubled ourselves to hunt up mistakes, but aimed solely to
<lb/>point out errors of principle in the works which we have noticed, and by
<lb/>this rule we shall always be guided. Personalities will always be avoided
<lb/>in our columns, but the perpetrator of a false principle in literature or
<lb/>art, must, of course, be made the object at which the battering-ram of criti-
<lb break="no"/>cism is directed. But this can be done with a sole view to demolish the
<lb/>principle, without any intent of injuring the person.</p><p>     We published, a month ago, an account of a new discovery in the art of
</p><p>reproducing engravings, and called attention to a specimen produced by
<lb/>the new process, which we had received from London, and hung up in
<lb/>our office. The Mirror of Tuesday evening, reprints the article, 
<lb/>and gives credit for it to the Britannia, and at the same time states that
<lb/>a specimen had been published by the Art-Union of this city. The article
<lb/>in the Mirror appeared first in the Art-Union, a monthly Magazine,
<lb/>published in London, in which Magazine the specimen alluded to first
<lb/>appeared. The American Art-Union of this city has not published any
<lb/>specimen, as a matter of course. We make this explanation simply be-
<lb break="no"/>cause the American Art-Union has some twenty-five hundred subscribers,
<lb/>who might be looking for their copy of the “ specimen," and attach blame
<lb/>to the officers of the institution for neglecting to send it to them. The
<lb/>Art-Union, the London Art-Union, and the American Art-Union, are
<lb/>three very distinct affairs, but a similarity of names leads to very frequent
<lb/>mistakes by our press, when alluding to them.</p><p></p><p>The "  Crossing’s Sweeper,” is very much to our mind, and creditable
<lb/>to the author’s heart and talents ; but parts of it are so marred by mere
<lb/>neglect, that we cannot publish it in its present state, although strongly
<lb/>tempted to do so.</p><p></p><p>The editor of the Philadelphia Sun has misunderstood our remarks on
<lb/>the Magazines : we certainly bear them no ill will, and do not see how
<lb/>they can possibly interfere with our own circulation. We thought that
<lb/>we paid them a very high compliment in saying that they were the best, I
<lb/>almost the only patrons of our native writers. We are extremely happy j
<lb/>to learn that Graham paid Cooper fifteen hundred dollars in seventeen
<lb/>months, and that Godey keeps almost as many ladies in his pay as the 
<lb/>Grand Turk ; but we have heard of writers, whose articles are certainly |
<lb/>equal to any thing of Cooper's that we have seen in Graham, to whom |
<lb/>that munificent publisher pays nothing.</p><p>MENDELSSOHN’S LOBGESANG.

TAKEN by Mons. EDOUART in an unique style pe-

Prospectus of the Broadway Journal.
To be Published every Saturday.
</p><p>The Broadway Journal will differ from any of the weekly Peri-
<lb break="no"/>odicals now published in this city, as it will be made up entirely of
<lb/>original matter, consisting of Essays, Criticisms on Art and Literature,
<lb/>Domestic and Foreign Correspondence, and Literary and Scientific
<lb/>Intelligence.</p><p></p><p>Illustrations will be given as often as good original Designs can
<lb/>be procured, and drawings and plans of all new public buildings that
<lb/>have either elegance or novelty to recommend them to notice. Par-
<lb break="no"/>ticular attention will be given to this department, and no pains spared
<lb/>to make it worthy ol patronage.</p><p></p><p>Efficient aid has already been secured in the services of some of the
<lb/>best writers in the country ; but it is hoped that a free channel be-
<lb break="no"/>ing opened through which true-hearted men may “ let loose their
<lb/>thoughts,” will be the means of drawing out some of the slumbering
<lb/>talent amongst us which has not yet been seen afloat on the surface of
<lb/>our periodical literature.</p><p></p><p>The Broadway Journal will espouse the cause of no political par-
<lb break="no"/>ty, but will hold itself free to condemn or approve any men or meas-
<lb break="no"/>ures, that a patriotic regard for the welfare of the country may dictate.
<lb/>It will be printed on fine paper with clear type, in the Octave form of
<lb/>16 pages, double columns.</p><p>Terms $3,00 per annum—Single numbers 6 1-4 cts.
