The Forest Reverie.
</p><p>’Tis said that when
<lb/>The hands of men
<lb/>Tamed this primeval wood,</p><p>And hoary trees with groans of wo,
Like warriors by an unknown foe,
Were in their strength subdued,
</p><p>The virgin Earth
<lb/>Gave instant birth
<lb/>To springs that ne’er did flow.—</p><p>That in the sun
Did rivulets run
And all around rare flowers did blow—
The wild rose pale
Perfumed the gale
</p><p>And the queenly Lily adown the dale
<lb/>(Whom the Sun and the dew
<lb/>And the winds did woo,)</p><p>With the gourd and the grape luxuriant grew.
</p><p>So when in tears
<lb/>The love of years
<lb/>Is wasted like the snow.</p><p></p><p>And the fine fibrils of its life
<lb/>By the rude wrong of instant strife
<lb/>Are broken at a blow—</p><p></p><p>Within the heart
<lb/>Do springs upstart
<lb/>Of which it doth not know,</p><p>And strange, sweet dreams,
Like silent streams
That from new fountains overflow,
With the earlier tide
Of rivers glide
Deep in the heart whose hope has died—
Quenching the fires its ashes hide,—
Its ashes, whence will spring and grow
Sweet flowers, ere long,—
The rare and radiant flowers of Song!

Ligeia.
</p><p>And the will therein lieth, which dieth not. Who knoweth the mysteries of
<lb/>the will, with its vigor? For God is but a great will pervading all things by
<lb/>nature of its intentness. Man doth not yield himself to the angels, nor unto
<lb/>death utterly, save only through the weakness of his feeble will.</p><p>Joseph Glanvill.
</p><p>I cannot, for my soul, remember how, when, or even pre-
<lb break="no"/>cisely where, I first became acquainted with the lady
<lb/>Ligeia. Long years have since elapsed, and my memory
<lb/>is feeble through much suffering. Or, perhaps, I cannot
<lb/>now bring these points to mind, because, in truth, the
<lb/>character of my beloved, her rare learning, her singular
<lb/>yet placid cast of beauty, and the thrilling and enthral-
<lb break="no"/>ling eloquence of her low musical language, made their
<lb/>way into my heart by paces so steadily and stealthily pro-
<lb break="no"/>gressive that they have been unnoticed and unknown.
<lb/>Yet I believe that I met her first and most frequently in</p><p></p><p>some large, old, decaying city near the Rhine. Of her
<lb/>family—I have surely heard her speak. That it is of a
<lb/>remotely ancient date cannot be doubted. Ligeia! Lige-
<lb break="no"/>ia! Buried in studies of a nature more than all else adap-
<lb break="no"/>ted to deaden impressions of the outward world, it is by
<lb/>that sweet word alone—by Ligeia—that I bring before
<lb/>mine eyes in fancy the image of her who is no more. And
<lb/>now, while I write, a recollection flashes upon me that I
<lb/>have never known the paternal name of her who was my
<lb/>friend and my betrothed, and who became the partner of
<lb/>my studies, and finally the wife of my bosom. Was it a
<lb/>playful charge on the part of my Ligeia ? or was it a test
<lb/>of my strength of affection, that I should institute no in-
<lb break="no"/>quiries upon this point? or was it rather a caprice of my
<lb/>own—a wildly romantic offering on the shrine of the most
<lb/>passionate devotion? I but indistinctly recall the fact
<lb/>itself—what wonder that I have utterly forgotten the cir-
<lb break="no"/>cumstances which originated or attended it ? And, indeed,
<lb/>if ever that spirit which is entitled Romance—if ever she,
<lb/>the wan and the misty-winged Ashtophet of idolatrous
<lb/>Egypt, presided, as they tell, over marriages ill-omened,
<lb/>then most surely she presided over mine.</p><p></p><p>There is one dear topic, however, on which my memory
<lb/>fails me not. It is the person of Ligeia. In stature she
<lb/>was tall, somewhat slender, and, in her latter days, even
<lb/>emaciated. I would in vain attempt to portray the maj-
<lb break="no"/>esty, the quiet ease, of her demeanor, or the incomprehen-
<lb break="no"/>sible lightness and elasticity of her footfall. She came
<lb/>and departed as a shadow. I was never made aware of
<lb/>her entrance into my closed study save by the dear music
<lb/>of her low sweet voice, as she placed her marble hand
<lb/>upon my shoulder. In beauty of face no maiden ever
<lb/>equalled her. It was the radiance of an opium dream—
<lb/>an airy and spirit-lifting vision more wildly divine than
<lb/>the phantasies which hovered about the slumbering souls
<lb/>of the daughters of Delos. Yet her features were not of
<lb/>that regular mould which we have been falsely taught to
<lb/>worship in the classical labors of the heathen. “ There is
<lb/>no exquisite beauty,” says Bacon, Lord Verulam, speak-
<lb break="no"/>ing truly of all the forms and genera of beauty, “without
<lb/>some strangeness in the proportion.” Yet, although I
<lb/>saw that the features of Ligeia were not of a classic reg-
<lb break="no"/>ularity—although I perceived that her loveliness was in-</p><p></p><p>deed “ exquisite,” and felt that there was much of
<lb/>“strangeness” pervading it, yet I have tried in vain to
<lb/>detect the irregularity and to trace home my own percep-
<lb break="no"/>tion of “ the strange.” I examined the contour of the lofty
<lb/>and pale forehead—it was faultless—how cold indeed that
<lb/>word when applied to a majesty so divine !—the skin riv-
<lb break="no"/>alling the purest ivory, the commanding extent and repose,
<lb/>the gentle prominence of the regions above the temples;
<lb/>and then the raven-black, the glossy, the luxuriant and
<lb/>naturally-curling tresses, setting forth the full force of the
<lb/>Homeric epithet, “ hyacinthine !” I looked at the deli-
<lb break="no"/>cate outlines of the nose—and nowhere but in the grace-</p><p><pb n="172" break="no" />
</p><p>ful medallions of the Hebrews had I beheld a similar per-
<lb break="no"/>fection. There were the same luxurious smoothness of
<lb/>surface, the same scarcely perceptible tendency to the
<lb/>aquiline, the same harmoniously curved nostrils speak-
<lb break="no"/>ing the free spirit. I regarded the sweet mouth. Here
<lb/>was indeed the triumph of all things heavenly—the mag-
<lb break="no"/>nificent turn of the short upper lip—the soft, voluptuous
<lb/>slumber of the under—the dimples which sported, and the
<lb/>color which spoke—the teeth glancing back, with a bril-
<lb break="no"/>liancy almost startling, every ray of the holy light which
<lb/>fell upon them in her serene and placid, yet most exult-
<lb break="no"/>ingly radiant of all smiles. I scrutinized the formation
<lb/>of the chin—and here, too, I found the gentleness of
<lb/>breadth, the softness and the majesty, the fullness and the
<lb/>spirituality, of the Greek—the contour which the God
<lb/>Apollo revealed but in a dream, to Cleomenes, the son of
<lb/>the Athenian. And then I peered into the large eyes of
<lb/>Ligeia.</p><p></p><p>For eyes we have no models in the remotely antique.
<lb/>It might have been, too, that in these eyes of my beloved
<lb/>lay the secret to which Lord Verulam alludes. They
<lb/>were, I must believe, far larger than the ordinary eyes of
<lb/>our own race. They were even fuller than the fullest of
<lb/>the gazelle eyes of the tribe of the valley of Nourjahad.
<lb/>Yet it was only at intervals—in moments of intense excite-
<lb break="no"/>ment—that this peculiarity became more than slightly
<lb/>noticeable in Ligeia. And at such moments was her
<lb/>beauty—in my heated fancy thus it appeared perhaps—
<lb/>the beauty of beings either above or apart from the earth
<lb/>—the beauty of the fabulous Houri of the Turk. The hue
<lb/>of the orbs was the most brilliant of black, and, far over
<lb/>them, hung jetty lashes of great length. The brows,
<lb/>slightly irregular in outline, had the same tint. The
<lb/>“strangeness,” however, which I found in the eyes, was
<lb/>of a nature distinct from the formation, or the color, or
<lb/>the brilliancy of the features, and must, after all, be re-
<lb break="no"/>ferred to the expression. Ah, word of no meaning ! be-
<lb break="no"/>hind whose vast latitude of mere sound we intrench our
<lb/>ignorance of so much of the spiritual. The expression
<lb/>of the eyes of Ligeia ! How for long hours have I pon-
<lb break="no"/>dered upon it! How have I, through the whole of a
<lb/>midsummer night, struggled to fathom it! What was it
<lb/>—that something more profound than the well of Demo-
<lb break="no"/>critus—which lay far within the pupils of my beloved ?
<lb/>What was it? I was possessed with a passion to discov-
<lb break="no"/>er. Those eyes ! those large, those shining, those divine
<lb/>orbs ! they became to me twin stars of Leda, and I to
<lb/>them devoutest of astrologers.</p><p></p><p>There is no point, among the many incomprehensible
<lb/>anomalies of the science of mind, more thrillingly excit-
<lb break="no"/>ing than the fact—never, I believe, noticed in the schools
<lb/>—that, in our endeavors to recall to memory something
<lb/>long forgotten, we often find ourselves upon the very verge
<lb/>of remembrance, without being able, in the end, to remem-
<lb break="no"/>ber. And thus how frequently, in my intense scrutiny of
<lb/>Ligeia’s eyes, have I felt approaching the full knowledge
<lb/>of their expression—felt it approaching—yet not quite be
<lb/>mine—and so at length entirely depart! And (strange,
<lb/>oh strangest mystery of all!) I found, in the commonest
<lb/>objects of the universe, a circle of analogies to that ex-
<lb break="no"/>pression. I mean to say that, subsequently to the period
<lb/>when Ligeia’s beauty passed into my spirit, there dwel-
<lb break="no"/>ling as in a shrine, I derived, from many existences in the
<lb/>material world, a sentiment such as I felt always around
<lb/>within me by her large and luminous orbs. Yet not the
<lb/>more could I define that sentiment, or analyze, or even</p><p></p><p>steadily view it. I recognized it, let me repeat, some-
<lb break="no"/>times in the survey of a rapidly-growing vine—in the
<lb/>contemplation of a moth, a butterfly, a chrysalis, a stream
<lb/>of running water. I have felt it in the ocean ; in the fal-
<lb break="no"/>ling of a meteor. I have felt it in the glances of unusu-
<lb break="no"/>ally aged people. And there are one or two stars in heav-
<lb break="no"/>en—(one especially, a star of the sixth magnitude, double
<lb/>and changeable, to be found near the large star in Lyra)
<lb/>in a telescopic scrutiny of which I have been made aware
<lb/>of the feeling. I have been filled with it by certain sounds
<lb/>from stringed instruments, and not unfrequently by passa-
<lb break="no"/>ges from books. Among innumerable other instances, I
<lb/>well remember something in a volume of Joseph Glanvill,
<lb/>which (perhaps merely from its quaintness—who shall
<lb/>say?) never failed to inspire me with the sentiment;—
<lb/>“ And the will therein lieth, which dieth not. Who
<lb/>knoweth the mysteries of the will, with its vigor ? For
<lb/>God is but a great will pervading all things by nature of
<lb/>its intentness. Man doth not yield him to the angels, nor
<lb/>unto death utterly, save only through the weakness of his
<lb/>feeble will.”</p><p></p><p>Length of years, and subsequent reflection, have enabled
<lb/>me to trace, indeed, some remote connection between this
<lb/>passage in the English moralist and a portion of the char-
<lb break="no"/>acter of Ligeia. An intensity in thought, action, or
<lb/>speech, was possibly, in her, a result, or at least an index,
<lb/>of that gigantic volition which, during our long inter-
<lb break="no"/>course, failed to give other and more immediate evidence
<lb/>of its existence. Of all the women whom I have ever
<lb/>known, she, the outwardly calm, the ever-placid Ligeia,
<lb/>was the most violently a prey to the tumultuous vultures
<lb/>of stern passion. And of such passion I could form no
<lb/>estimate, save by the miraculous expansion of those eyes
<lb/>which at once so delighted and appalled me—by the al-
<lb break="no"/>most magical melody, modulation, distinctness and pla-
<lb break="no"/>cidity of her very low voice—and by the fierce energy
<lb/>(rendered doubly effective by contrast with her manner of
<lb/>utterance) of the wild words which she habitually ut-
<lb break="no"/>tered.</p><p></p><p>I have spoken of the learning of Ligeia: it was im-
<lb break="no"/>mense—such as I have never known in woman. In the
<lb/>classical tongues was she deeply proficient, and as far as
<lb/>my own acquaintance extended in regard to the modern
<lb/>dialects of Europe, I have never known her at fault. In-
<lb break="no"/>deed upon any theme of the most admired, because simply
<lb/>the most abstruse of the boasted erudition of the acade-
<lb break="no"/>my, have I ever found Ligeia at fault? How singularly
<lb/>—how thrillingly, this one point in the nature of my wife
<lb/>has forced itself, at this late period only, upon my atten-
<lb break="no"/>tion! I said her knowledge was such as I have never
<lb/>known in woman—but where breathes the man who has
<lb/>traversed, and successfully, all the wide areas of moral,
<lb/>physical, and mathematical science ? I saw not then
<lb/>what I now clearly perceive, that the acquisitions of Li-
<lb break="no"/>geia were gigantic, were astounding ; yet I was suffi-
<lb break="no"/>ciently aware of her infinite supremacy to resign myself,
<lb/>with a child-like confidence, to her guidance through the
<lb/>chaotic world of metaphysical investigation at which I
<lb/>was most busily occupied during the earlier years of our
<lb/>marriage. With how vast a triumph—with how vivid a
<lb/>delight—with how much of all that is ethereal in hope—
<lb/>did I feel, as she bent over me in studies but little sought
<lb/>—but less known—that delicious vista by slow degrees
<lb/>expanding before me, down whose long, gorgeous, and all
<lb/>untrodden path, I might at length pass onware to the goal
<lb/>of a wisdom too divinely precious not to be forbidden !</p><p><pb n="173"/>
</p><p>How poignant, then, must have been the grief with
<lb/>which, after some years, I beheld'.my well-grounded ex-
<lb break="no"/>pectations take wings to themselves and fly away ! With-
<lb break="no"/>out Ligeia I was but as a child groping benighted. Her
<lb/>presence, her readings alone, rendered vividly luminous
<lb/>the many mysteries of the transcendentalism in which we
<lb/>were immersed. Wanting the radiant lustre of her eyes,
<lb/>letters, lambent and golden, grew duller than Saturnian
<lb/>lead. And now those eyes shone less and less frequently
<lb/>upon the pages over which I pored. Ligeia grew ill.
<lb/>The wild eyes blazed with a too—too glorious effulgence ;
<lb/>the pale fingers became of the transparent waxen hue of
<lb/>the grave, and the blue veins upon the lofty forehead
<lb/>swelled and sank impetuously with the tides of the most
<lb/>gentle emotion. I saw that she must die—and I struggled
<lb/>desperately in spirit with the grim Azrael. And the strug-
<lb break="no"/>gles of the passionate wife were, to my astonishment,
<lb/>even more energetic than my own. There had been much
<lb/>in her stern nature to impress me with the belief that, to
<lb/>her, death would have come without its terrors ;—but not
<lb/>so. Words are impotent to convey any just idea of the
<lb/>fierceness of resistance with which she wrestled with the
<lb/>Shadow. I groaned in anguish at the pitiable spectacle.</p><p></p><p>I would have soothed—I would have reasoned ; hut, in the
<lb/>intensity of her wild desire for life,—for life—but for life
<lb/>—solace and reason were alike the uttermost of folly. Yet
<lb/>not until the last instance, amid the most convulsive writh-
<lb break="no"/>ings of her fierce spirit, was shaken the external placidity
<lb/>of her demeanor. Her voice grew more gentle—grew more
<lb/>low—yet I would not wish to dwell upon the wild meaning
<lb/>of the quietly uttered words. My brain reeled as I
<lb/>hearkened entranced, to a melody more than mortal—to
<lb/>assumptions and aspirations which mortality had never
<lb/>before known.</p><p></p><p>That she loved me I should not have doubted ; and I
<lb/>might have been easily a ware that, in a bosom such as hers,
<lb/>love would have reigned no ordinary passion. But in
<lb/>death only, was I fully impressed with the strength of her
<lb/>affection. For long hours, detaining my hand, would she
<lb/>pour out before me the overflowing of a heart whose more
<lb/>than passionate devotion amounted to idolatry. How had
<lb/>I deserved to be so blessed by such confessions?—how had
<lb/>I deserved to be so cursed with the removal of my beloved
<lb/>in the hour of her making them? But upon this subject I
<lb/>cannot hear to dilate. Let me say only, that in Ligeia’s
<lb/>more than womanly abandonment to a love, alas! all un-
<lb break="no"/>merited, all unworthily bestowed, I at length recognized
<lb/>the principle of her longing with so wildly earnest a de-
<lb break="no"/>sire for the life which was how fleeing so rapidly away.
<lb/>It is this wild longing—it is this eager vehemence of de-
<lb break="no"/>sire for life—but for life—that I have no power to portray
<lb/>—no utterance capable of expressing.</p><p></p><p>At high noon of the night in which she departed, beck-
<lb break="no"/>oning me, peremptorily, to her side, she bade me repeat
<lb/>certain verses composed by herself not many days before.</p><p>I obeyed her.—They were these:
Lo! ’tis a gala night
Within the lonesome latter years!
An angel throng, bewinged, bedight
In veils, and drowned in tears,
Sit in a theatre, to see
A play of hopes and fears,
While the orchestra breathes fitfully
The music of the spheres.
Mimes, in the form of God on high,
Mutter and mumble low,
And hither and thither fly—
</p><p>Mere puppets they, who come and go
<lb/>At bidding of vast formless things
<lb/>That shift the scenery to and fro,</p><p>Flapping from out their Condor wings
Invisible Wo!
That motley drama !—oh, be sure
It shall not be forgot!
With its Phantom chased forevermore,
By a crowd that seize it not,
Through a circle that ever returneth in
To the self-same spot,
And much of Madness and more of Sin,
And Horror the soul of the plot.
But see, amid the mimic rout,
A crawling shape intrude!
A blood-red thing that writhes from out
The scenic solitude!
It writhes!—it writhes!—with mortal pangs
The mimes become its food,
And the seraphs sob at vermin fangs
In human gore imbued.
Out—out are the lights—out all!
And over each quivering form,
The curtain, a funeral pall,
Comes down with the rush of a storm
And the angels, all pallid and wan,
Uprising, unveiling, affirm
That the play is the tragedy, “ Man,”
And its hero the Conqueror Worm.
</p><p>“O God!” half shrieked Ligeia, leaping to her feet
<lb/>and extending her arms aloft with a spasmodic movement,
<lb/>as I made an end of these lines—“O God! O Divine
<lb/>Father!—shall these things be undeviatingly so ?—shall
<lb/>this Conqueror be not once conquered ? Are we not
<lb/>part and parcel in Thee ? Who—who knoweth the mys-
<lb break="no"/>teries of the will with its vigor ? Man doth not yield
<lb/>him to the angels, nor unto death utterly, save only
<lb/>through the weakness of his feeble will.”</p><p></p><p>And now, as if exhausted with emotion, she suffered
<lb/>her white arms to fall, and returned solemnly to her bed
<lb/>of Death. And as she breathed her last sighs, there came
<lb/>mingled with them a low murmur from her lips. I bent
<lb/>to them my ear and distinguished, again, the concluding
<lb/>words of the passage in Glanvill—“ Man doth not yield
<lb/>him to the angels, nor unto death utterly, save only
<lb/>through the weakness of his feeble will."</p><p></p><p>She died ;—and I, crushed into the very dust with sorrow,
<lb/>could no longer endure the lonely desolation of my dwel-
<lb break="no"/>ling in the dim and decaying city by the Rhine. I had
<lb/>no lack of what the world calls wealth. Ligeia had
<lb/>brought me far more, very far more than ordinarily falls
<lb/>to the lot of mortals. After a few months, therefore, of
<lb/>weary and aimless wandering, I purchased, and put in
<lb/>some repair, an abbey, which I shall not name, in one of
<lb/>the wildest and least frequented portions of fair England.
<lb/>The gloomy and dreary grandeur of the building, the al-
<lb break="no"/>most savage aspect of the domain, the many melancho-
<lb break="no"/>ly and time-honored memories connected with both, had
<lb/>much in unison with the feelings of utter abandonment
<lb/>which had driven me into that remote and unsocial region
<lb/>of the country. Yet although the external abbey, with
<lb/>its verdant decay hanging about it, suffered but little al-
<lb break="no"/>teration, I gave way, with a child-like perversity, and
<lb/>perchance with a faint hope of alleviating my sorrows,
<lb/>to a display of more than regal magnificence within.—
<lb/>For such follies, even in childhood, I had imbibed a taste</p><p><pb n="174"/>
</p><p>and now they came back to me as if in the dotage of
<lb/>grief. Alas, I feel how much even of incipient madness
<lb/>might have been discovered in the gorgeous and fantastic
<lb/>draperies, in the solemn carvings of Egypt, in the wild
<lb/>cornices and furniture, in the Bedlam patterns of the car-
<lb break="no"/>pets of tufted gold! I had become a bounden slave in
<lb/>the trammels of opium, and my labors and my orders had
<lb/>taken a coloring from my dreams. But these absurdities
<lb/>I must not pause to detail. Let me speak only of that
<lb/>one chamber, ever accursed, whither in a moment of men-
<lb break="no"/>tal alienation, I led from the altar as my bride—as the
<lb/>successor of the unforgotten Ligeia—the fair-haired and
<lb/>blue-eyed Lady Rowena Trevanion, of Tremaine.</p><p></p><p>There is no individual portion of the architecture and
<lb/>decoration of that bridal chamber which is not now visi-
<lb break="no"/>bly before me. Where were the souls of the haughty
<lb/>family of the bride, when, through thirst of gold, they
<lb/>permitted to pass the threshold of an apartment so be-
<lb break="no"/>decked, a maiden and a daughter so beloved ? I have
<lb/>said that I minutely remember the details of the cham-
<lb break="no"/>ber—yet I am sadly forgetful on topics of deep moment
<lb/>—and here there was no system, no keeping, in the fan-
<lb break="no"/>tastic display, to take hold upon the memory. The room
<lb/>lay in a high turret of the castellated abbey, was penta-
<lb break="no"/>gonal in shape, and of capacious size. Occupying the
<lb/>whole southern face of the pentagon was the sole win-
<lb break="no"/>dow—an immense sheet of unbroken glass from Venice
<lb/>—a single pane, and tinted of a leaden hue, so that the
<lb/>rays of either the sun or moon, passing through it, fell
<lb/>with a ghastly lustre on the objects within. Over the
<lb/>upper portion of this huge window, extended the trellice-
<lb break="no"/>work of an aged vine, which clambered up the massy
<lb/>walls of the turret. The ceiling, of gloomy-looking oak,
<lb/>was excessively lofty, vaulted, and elaborately fretted
<lb/>with the wildest and most grotesque specimens of a semi-
<lb break="no"/>Gothic, semi-Druidical device. From out the most cen-
<lb break="no"/>tral recess of this melancholy vaulting, depended, by a
<lb/>single chain of gold with long links, a huge censer of the
<lb/>same metal, Saracenic in pattern, and with many perfora-
<lb break="no"/>tions so contrived that there writhed in and out of them,
<lb/>as if endued with a serpent vitality, a continual succes-
<lb break="no"/>sion of parti-colored fires.</p><p></p><p>Some few ottomans and golden candelabra, of Eastern
<lb/>figure, were in various stations about—and there was the 
<lb/>couch, too—the bridal couch—of an Indian model, and
<lb/>low, and sculptured of solid ebony, with a pall-like cano-
<lb break="no"/>py above. In each of the angles of the chamber stood
<lb/>on end a gigantic sarcophagus of black granite, from the
<lb/>tombs of the kings over against Luxor, with their aged
<lb/>lids full of immemorial sculpture. But in the draping of 
<lb/>the apartment lay, alas ! the chief phantasy of all. The
<lb/>lofty walls, gigantic in height—even unproportionably so
<lb/>—were hung from summit to foot, in vast folds, with a
<lb/>heavy and massive-looking tapestry—tapestry of a ma-
<lb break="no"/>terial which was found alike as a carpet on the floor, as
<lb/>a covering for the ottomans and the ebony bed, as a cano-
<lb break="no"/>py for the bed, and as the gorgeous volutes of the cur-
<lb break="no"/>tains which partially shaded the window. The material
<lb/>was the richest cloth of gold. It was spotted all over, at
<lb/>irregular intervals, with arabesque figures, about a foot
<lb/>in diameter, and wrought upon the cloth in patterns of
<lb/>the most jetty black. But these figures partook of the
<lb/>true character of the arabesque only when regarded from
<lb/>a single point of view. By a contrivance now common,
<lb/>and indeed traceable to a very remote period of antiqui-
<lb break="no"/>ty, they were made changeable in aspect. To one enter-</p><p></p><p>ing the room, they bore the appearance of simple mon-
<lb break="no"/>strosities ; but upon a farther advance, this appearance
<lb/>gradually departed ; and step by step, as the visiter mov-
<lb break="no"/>ed his station in the chamber, he saw himself surrounded
<lb/>by an endless succession of the ghastly forms which be-
<lb break="no"/>long to the superstition of the Norman, or arise in the
<lb/>guilty slumbers of the monk. The phantasmagoric effect
<lb/>was vastly heightened by the artificial introduction of a
<lb/>strong continual current of wind behind the draperies—
<lb/>giving a hideous and uneasy animation to the whole.</p><p></p><p>In halls such as these—in a bridal chamber such as
<lb/>this—I passed, with the Lady of Tremaine, the unhal-
<lb break="no"/>lowed hours of the first month of our marriage—passed
<lb/>them with but little disquietude. That my wife dreaded
<lb/>the fierce moodiness of my temper—that she shunned me
<lb/>and loved me but little—I could not help perceiving ; but
<lb/>it gave me rather pleasure than otherwise. I loathed
<lb/>her with a hatred belonging more to demon than to man.
<lb/>My memory flew back, (oh, with what intensity of re-
<lb break="no"/>gret !) to Ligeia, the beloved, the august, the beautiful,
<lb/>the entombed. I revelled in recollections of her purity,
<lb/>of her wisdom, of her lofty, her ethereal nature, of her
<lb/>passionate, her idolatrous love. Now, then, did my spirit
<lb/>fully and freely burn with more than all the fires of her
<lb/>own. In the excitement of my opium dreams (for I was
<lb/>habitually fettered in the shackles of the drug) I would
<lb/>call aloud upon her name, during the silence of the night,
<lb/>or among the sheltered recesses of the glens by day, as
<lb/>if, through the wild eagerness, the solemn passion, the
<lb/>consuming ardor of my longing for the departed, I could
<lb/>restore her to the pathway she had abandoned—ah, could
<lb/>it be forever?—upon the earth.</p><p></p><p>About the commencement of the second month of the
<lb/>marriage, the Lady Rowena was attacked with sudden
<lb/>illness, from which her recovery was slow. The fever
<lb/>which consumed her rendered her nights uneasy ; and in
<lb/>her pertubed state of half-slumber, she spoke of sounds,
<lb/>and of motions, in and about the chamber of the turret,
<lb/>which I concluded had no origin save in the distemper of
<lb/>her fancy, or perhaps in the phantasmagoric influences
<lb/>of the chamber itself. She became at length convales-
<lb break="no"/>cent—finally well. Yet but a brief period elapsed, ere a
<lb/>second more violent disorder again threw her upon a bed
<lb/>of suffering; and from this attack her frame, at all times
<lb/>feeble, never altogether recovered. Her illnesses were,
<lb/>after this epoch, of alarming character, and of more
<lb/>alarming recurrence, defying alike the knowledge
<lb/>and the great exertions of her physicians. With
<lb/>the increase of the chronic disease which had thus,
<lb/>apparently, taken too sure hold upon her constitu-
<lb break="no"/>tion to be eradicated by human means, I could not
<lb/>fail to observe a similar increase in the nervous irritation
<lb/>of her temperament, and in her excitability by trivial
<lb/>causes of fear. She spoke again, and now more frequent-
<lb break="no"/>ly and pertinaciously, of the sounds—of the slight sounds
<lb/>—and of the unusual motions among the tapestries, to
<lb/>which she had formerly alluded.</p><p></p><p>One night, near the closing in of September, she pres-
<lb break="no"/>sed this distressing subject with more than usual empha-
<lb break="no"/>sis upon my attention. She had just awakened from an
<lb/>unquiet slumber, and I had been watching, with feelings
<lb/>half of anxiety, half of a vague terror, the workings of
<lb/>her emaciated countenance. I sat by the side of her
<lb/>ebony bed, upon one of the ottomans of India. She part-
<lb break="no"/>ly arose, and spoke, in an earnest low whisper, of sounds
<lb/>which she then heard, but which I could not hear—of</p><p><pb n="175"/>
</p><p>motions which she then saw, but which I could not per-
<lb break="no"/>ceive. The wind was rushing hurriedly behind the ta-
<lb break="no"/>pestries, and I wished to show her (what, let me confess
<lb/>it, I could not all believe) that those almost inarticulate
<lb/>breathings, and those very gentle variations of the figures
<lb/>upon the wall, were but the natural effects of that custo-
<lb break="no"/>mary rushing of the wind. But a deadly pallor, over-
<lb break="no"/>spreading her face, had proved to me that my exertions
<lb/>to reassure her would be fruitless. She appeared to be
<lb/>fainting, and no attendants were within call. I remem-
<lb break="no"/>bered where was deposited a decanter of light wine which
<lb/>had been ordered by her physicians, and hastened across
<lb/>the chamber to procure it. But, as I stepped beneath the
<lb/>light of the censer, two circumstances of a startling na-
<lb break="no"/>ture attracted my attention. I had felt that some palpa-
<lb break="no"/>ble although invisible object had passed lightly by my
<lb/>person ; and I saw that there lay upon the golden carpet,
<lb/>in the very middle of the rich lustre thrown from the
<lb/>censer, a shadow—a faint, indefinite shadow of angelic
<lb/>aspect—such as might be fancied for the shadow of a
<lb/>shade. But I was wild with the excitement of an immo-
<lb break="no"/>derate dose of opium, and heeded these things but little,
<lb/>nor spoke of them to Rowena. Having found the wine,
<lb/>I recrossed the chamber, and poured out a goblet-ful,
<lb/>which I held to the lips of the fainting lady. She had
<lb/>now partially recovered, however, and took the vessel
<lb/>herself, while I sank upon an ottoman near me, with ray
<lb/>eyes fastened upon her person. It was then that I became
<lb/>distinctly aware of a gentle foot-fall upon the carpet, and
<lb/>near the couch; and in a second thereafter, as Rowena
<lb/>Was in the act of raising the wine to her lips, I saw, or
<lb/>may have dreamed that I saw, fall within the goblet, as
<lb/>if from some invisible spring in the atmosphere of the
<lb/>room, three or four large drops of a brilliant and ruby
<lb/>colored fluid. If this I saw—not so Rowena. She swal-
<lb break="no"/>lowed the wine unhesitatingly, and I forbore to speak to
<lb/>her of a circumstance which must, after all, I consider-
<lb break="no"/>ed, have been but the suggestion of a vivid imagination,
<lb/>rendered morbidly active by the terror of the lady, by
<lb/>the opium, and by the hour.</p><p></p><p>Yet I cannot conceal it from my own perception that,
<lb/>immediately subsequent to the fall of the ruby-drops, a
<lb/>rapid change for the worse took place in the disorder of
<lb/>my wife ; so that, on the third subsequent night, the hands
<lb/>of her menials prepared her for the tomb, and on the
<lb/>fourth, I sat alone, with her shrouded body, in that fan-
<lb break="no"/>tastic chamber which had received her as my bride.—
<lb/>Wild visions, opium-engendered, flitted, shadow-like, be-
<lb break="no"/>fore me. I gazed with unquiet eye upon the sarcophagi
<lb/>in the angles of the room, upon the varying figures of the
<lb/>draperry, and upon the writhing of the parti-colored fires
<lb/>in the censer overhead. My eyes then fell, as I called to
<lb/>mind the circumstances of a former night, to the spot be-
<lb break="no"/>neath the glare of the censer where I had seen the faint
<lb/>traces of the shadow. It was there, however, no longer;
<lb/>and breathing with greater freedom, I turned my glances
<lb/>to the pallid and rigid figure upon the bed. Then rushed
<lb/>upon me a thousand memories of Ligeia—and then came
<lb/>back upon my heart, with the turbulent violence of a
<lb/>flood, the whole of that unutterable wo with which I had
<lb/>regarded her thus enshrouded. The night waned; and
<lb/>still, with a bosom full of bitter thoughts of the one only
<lb/>and supremely beloved, I remained gazing upon the body
<lb/>of Rowena.</p><p>It might have been midnight, or perhaps earlier, or
later, for I had taken no note of time, when a sob, low,
</p><p>gentle, but very distinct, startled me from my revery.—
<lb/>I felt that it came from the bed of ebony—the bed of
<lb/>death. I listened in an agony of superstitious terror—hut
<lb/>there was no repetition of the sound. I strained my vis-
<lb break="no"/>ion to detect any motion in the corpse—but there was not
<lb/>the slightest perceptible. Yet I could not have been de-
<lb break="no"/>ceived. I had heard the noise, however faint, and my
<lb/>soul was awakened within me. I resolutely and perse-
<lb break="no"/>veringly kept my attention riveted upon the body. Many
<lb/>minutes elapsed before any circumstance occurred tend-
<lb break="no"/>ing to throw light upon the mystery. At length it be-
<lb break="no"/>came evident that a slight, a very feeble, and barely no-
<lb break="no"/>ticeable tinge of color had flushed up within the cheeks,
<lb/>and along the sunken small veins of the eyelids. Through
<lb/>a species of unutterable horror and awe, for which the
<lb/>language of mortality has no sufficiently energetic expres-
<lb break="no"/>sion, I felt my heart cease to beat, my limbs grow rigid
<lb/>where I sat. Yet a sense of duty finally operated to res-
<lb break="no"/>tore my self-possession. I could no longer doubt that we
<lb/>had been precipitate in our preparations—that Rowena
<lb/>still lived. It was necessary that some immediate exer-
<lb break="no"/>tion be made ; yet the turret was altogether apart from
<lb/>the portion of the abbey tenanted by the servants—there
<lb/>were none within call—I had no means of summoning
<lb/>them to my aid without leaving the room for many mi-
<lb break="no"/>nutes—and this I could not venture to do. I therefore
<lb/>struggled alone in my endeavors to call back the spirit
<lb/>still hovering. In a short period it was certain, however,
<lb/>that a relapse had taken place ; the color disappeared
<lb/>from both eyelid and cheek, leaving a wanness even more
<lb/>than that of marble ; the lips became doubly shrivelled
<lb/>and pinched up in the ghastly expression of death; a re-
<lb break="no"/>pulsive clamminess and coldness overspread rapidly the
<lb/>surface of the body ; and all the usual rigorous stiffness
<lb/>immediately supervened. I fell back with a shudder upon
<lb/>the couch from which I had been so startlingly aroused,
<lb/>and again gave myself up to passionate waking visions of
<lb/>Ligeia.</p><p></p><p>An hour thus elapsed when (could it be possible ?) I was
<lb/>a second time aware of some vague sound issuing from
<lb/>the region of the bed. I listened—in extremity of hor-
<lb break="no"/>ror. The sound came again—it was a sigh. Rushing to
<lb/>the corpse, I saw—distinctly saw—a tremor upon the lips.
<lb/>In a minute afterward they relaxed, disclosing a bright
<lb/>line of the pearly teeth. Amazement now struggled in
<lb/>my bosom with the profound awe which had hitherto
<lb/>reigned there alone. I felt that my vision grew dim,
<lb/>that my reason wandered ; and it was only by a violent
<lb/>effort that I at length succeeded in nerving myself to the
<lb/>task which duty thus once more had pointed out. There
<lb/>was now a partial glow upon the forehead and upon the
<lb/>cheek and throat; a perceptible warmth pervaded the
<lb/>whole frame ; there was even a slight pulsation at the
<lb/>heart. The lady lived ; and with redoubled ardor I be-
<lb break="no"/>took myself to the task of restoration. I chafed and
<lb/>bathed the temples and the hands, and used every exer-
<lb break="no"/>tion which experience, and no little medical reading,
<lb/>could suggest. But in vain. Suddenly, the color fled,
<lb/>the pulsation ceased, the lips resumed the expression of
<lb/>the dead, and, in an instant afterward, the whole body
<lb/>took upon itself the icy chilliness, the livid hue, the in-
<lb break="no"/>tense rigidity, the sunken outline, and all the loathsome
<lb/>peculiarities of that which has been, for many days, a te-
<lb break="no"/>nant of the tomb.</p><p>And again I sunk into visions of Ligeia—and again,
(what marvel that I shudder while I write ?) again there
<pb n="176"/>
</p><p>reached my ears a low sob from the region of the ebony
<lb/>bed. But why shall I minutely detail the unspeakable
<lb/>horrors of that night ? Why shall I pause to relate how,
<lb/>time after time, until near the period of the gray dawn,
<lb/>this hideous drama of revivication was repeated ; how
<lb/>each terrific relapse was only into a sterner and apparently
<lb/>more irredeemable death ; how each agony wore the as-
<lb break="no"/>pect of a struggle with some invisible foe ; and how each
<lb/>struggle was succeeded by I know not what of wild
<lb/>change in the personal appearance of the corpse ? Let
<lb/>me hurry to a conclusion.</p><p></p><p>The greater part of the fearfnl night had worn away,
<lb/>and she who had been dead, once again stirred—and now
<lb/>more vigorously than hitherto, although arousing from a
<lb/>dissolution more appalling in its utter hopelessness than
<lb/>any. I had long ceased to struggle or to move, and re-
<lb break="no"/>mained sitting rigidly upon the ottoman, a helpless prey
<lb/>to a whirl of violent emotions, of which extreme awe
<lb/>was perhaps the least terrible, the least consuming. The
<lb/>corpse, I repeat, stirred, and now more vigorously than
<lb/>before. The hues of life flushed up with unwonted ener-
<lb break="no"/>gy into the countenance—the limbs relaxed—and, save
<lb/>that the eyelids were yet pressed heavily together, and
<lb/>that the bandages and draperies of the grave still impart-
<lb break="no"/>ed their charnel character to the figure, I might have
<lb/>dreamed that Rowena had indeed shaken off, utterly, the
<lb/>fetters of Death. But if this idea was not, even then, al-
<lb break="no"/>together adopted, I could at least doubt no longer, when,
<lb/>arising from the bed, tottering, with feeble steps, with
<lb/>closed eyes, and with the manner of one bewildered in a
<lb/>dream, the thing that was enshrouded advanced boldly
<lb/>and palpably into the middle of the apartment.</p><p></p><p>I trembled not—I stirred not—for a crowd of unutterable
<lb/>fancies connected with the air, the stature, the demeanor
<lb/>of the figure, rushing hurridly through ray brain, had par-
<lb break="no"/>alyzed—had chilled me into stone. I stirred not—but
<lb/>gazed upon the apparition. There was a mad disorder in
<lb/>my thoughts—a tumult unappeasable. Could it, indeed,
<lb/>be the living Rowena who confronted me ? Could it indeed
<lb/>be Rowena at all—the fair-haired, the blue-eyed Lady
<lb/>Rowena Trevanion of Tremaine ? Why, why should I
<lb/>doubt it ? The bandage lay heavily about the mouth—but
<lb/>then might it not be the mouth of the breathing Lady of
<lb/>Tremaine ? And the cheeks—there were the roses as in
<lb/>her noon of life—yes, these might indeed be the fair cheeks
<lb/>of the living Lady of Tremaine. And the chin, with its
<lb/>dimples, as in health, might it not be hers ?—but had she
<lb/>then grown taller since her malady ? What inexpressible
<lb/>madness seized me with that thought ? One bound, and I
<lb/>had reached her feet! Shrinking from my touch, she let
<lb/>fall from her head, unloosened,the ghastly cerements which
<lb/>had confined it, and there streamed forth, into the rushing
<lb/>atmosphere of the chamber, huge masses of long and dis-
<lb break="no"/>shevelled hair ; it was blacker than the raven wings of the
<lb/>midnight ! And now slowly opened the eyes of the figure
<lb/>which stood before me. “ Here then, at least,” I shrieked
<lb/>aloud, “ can I never—can I never be mistaken—these arc
<lb/>the full, and the black, and the wild eyes—of my lost love
<lb/>—of the lady—of the Lady Ligeia!”                  Edgar A. Poe.</p><p>The Bread-Snatcher.
For two whole days we had no food;
</p><p>For dark, gigantic Want
<lb/>Beside our cold hearth-stone sat down,
<lb/>With Hunger, grim and gaunt.</p><p>My wife and children made no moan,
Nor spoke a single word ;
Yet in the chamber of my heart,
Their hearts’ complaint I heard.
Awearied by their weary eyes,
I left the house of wo,
And in the dusty village street
I paced me to and fro.
I stopped me at the baker’s shop,
</p><p>Wherein my eyes could see
<lb/>The great, round loaves of wheaten bread
<lb/>Look temptingly on me.</p><p>“My children shall not starve!” I cried—
The famine in me burned—
I slyly snatched a loaf of bread,
When the baker’s back was turned.
I hurried home with eager feet,
And there displayed my prize;
While Joy, so long afar from us,
Came back and lit our eyes.
To fragments in our hunger fierce
That sweet, sweet loaf we tore;
And gathered afterwards the crumbs,
From off the dusty floor.
While yet our mouths were full, there came
A knock which made us start;
I spoke not, yet I felt the blood
Grow thicker at my heart.
The latch was raised, and in there came
The neighbors with a din;
They said I stole the baker’s bread,
Which was a grievous sin.
They toot me to the judge who said
’Twas larceny—no less;
And doomed me to the gloomy jail
For wanton wickedness.
He asked me why the penalty
Of guilt should not be paid ;
And when I strove to state the case,
He laughed at what I said.
</p><p>Then growing grave, he rated me
<lb/>And told me it was time
<lb/>To check the vices of the poor,</p><p>And stop the spread of crime.
In jail for three long months I lay—
Three months of bitter wo—
And then they opened wide the door
And told me I might go.
From out the prison I did not walk
But ran, with trembling feet,
Down through tfie hall and past the door,
And up the busy street.
My feet had scarce devoured ten roda
Of ground, before a hearse,
Came slowly on with coffins three—
Each coffin with a corse.
I asked the driver as he sung,
Therein who might he bear;
He answered not, but stopped his voice,
And on me fixed a stare.
The one beside him turned his head,
And when the hearse had past,
1 heard him to the other say—
“His brain is turned, at last!”
<pb n="17"/> 7
I heeded not—I hastened home
And entered in my door,
Where Silence like a snake crept out
And slimed along the floor.
Our old cat from the corner came
And crooked her back and cried;
I stooped me down and stroked her hair,
And then I stood and sighed.
I left the house and sought the street—
My mind was growing wild;
And playing with a pile of dust,
I saw a chubby child.
"Come hither, my little dear,” said I,
“Where did the people go,
Who lived within yon empty house,
Two years or nearly so ?”
Then spake outright the little child,
While I grew deadly pale—
“The man, sir, was a wicked thief,
And he was sent to jail.
“His wife and children hid themselves,
But they were found to-day,
And in the gloomy poor-house hearse
Were taken far away.
“They say, they never will come back,
Because the three are dead—
But was it not a wicked thing
For THE MAN TO STEAL THE BREAD ?”
Thomas Dunn English.
Critical Notices.
</p><p>The Prose Works of John Milton, with a Biographical In-
<lb break="no"/>troduction by Rufus Wilmot Griswold. In Two Vol-
<lb break="no"/>umes. Philadelphia : Herman Hooker.</p><p></p><p>Dr. Griswold deserves the thanks of his countrymen
<lb/>for what he has here done:—it certainly is no credit to
<lb/>us, either as republicans or reverers of the true and noble
<lb/>in Literature, that no edition of the Prose Works of John
<lb/>Milton has hitherto been issued in America. Indepen-
<lb break="no"/>dently of the subject-matter, his treatises are among the
<lb/>roost remarkable ever written. Their mere style (we
<lb/>use the word in its widest sense) is absolutely unrivalled.
<lb/>It is a very difficult thing, indeed, to decide properly on
<lb/>the style of a period so remote as that of Milton; we are
<lb/>perpetually misled in our judgment, by the impossibility
<lb/>of identifying ourselves with the writers—of inducing
<lb/>a full sympathy with the circumstances which impelled
<lb/>them, and thus with the objects for which they wrote—
<lb/>the ends proposed in composition. In fact, it is only by
<lb/>the degree of its adjustment to the result intended, that
<lb/>any style can be justly commended as good or condemned
<lb/>as bad. But, folding in view this adjustment, and mak-
<lb break="no"/>ing the necessary allowances for lapses, effected through
<lb/>"Time, in the language, we feel ourselves fully warranted
<lb/>in saying, that no man has ever surpassed, if, indeed, any
<lb/>roan has ever equalled the author of the “ Areopagitica”
<lb/>in purity—in force—in copiousness—in majesty—or, in
<lb/>what may be termed without the least exaggeration, a
<lb/>gorgeous magnificence of style. Some of his more di-
<lb break="no"/>rectly controversial works rise at times into a species of
<lb/>lyrical rhapsody—divinely energetic—constituting for it-
<lb break="no"/>self a department of composition which is neither prose
<lb/>nor poetry, but something with all the best qualities of
<lb/>each, and upon the whole superior to either.</p><p>These two large volumes contain nearly all the prose
</p><p> works of Milton. We say nearly ; for there is an unwar-
<lb break="no"/> rantable omission in “ The Christian Doctrine.” Of the
<lb/>authenticity of this treatise there can be no doubt. It
<lb/>was found in 1823, by Mr. Lemon, Deputy Keeper of the
<lb/>State Papers, in the course of some researches among his
<lb/>book-shelves. It was a Latin MS. enveloped with
<lb/>some foreign despatches in Milton’s own hand, and su-
<lb break="no"/>perscribed “ To Mr. Skinner, Merchant.” According to
<lb/>Toland, this treatise was finished by its author soon after
<lb/>the Restoration :—a host of concurring circumstances ren-
<lb break="no"/>der its genuineness certain. Its value depends chiefly on
<lb/>the curious developments it affords in relation to the
<lb/>poet’s Arianism and opinions about polygamy—but its
<lb/>Latinity is so peculiarly forcible and fluent, in spite of
<lb/>the difficulties of the matter handled, that, on this score
<lb/>alone, the treatise demands insertion in any and every
<lb/>collection of the author’s prose: it should be left untrans-
<lb break="no"/>lated, of course: Dr. Sumner’s version is feeble. Of the
<lb/>“ Christian Doctrine,” Dr. Griswold says, in his Intro-
<lb break="no"/>duction, “ it is a work which he [Milton] never would
<lb/>have given to the press himself.” For this idea there is
<lb/>but little authority. The MS. was no doubt taken to
<lb/>the State Paper office, in consequence of a general seiz-
<lb break="no"/>ure of Milton’s papers, during the persecution of the
<lb/>Whigs upon the dissolution of the Oxford Parliament;
<lb/>for the poet must have fallen under suspicion. The publi-
<lb break="no"/>cation was thus prevented ; but evidence of the intent to
<lb/>publish is discoverable in the work itself. Dr. Griswold
<lb/>says also, that “in none of his great works is there a pas-
<lb break="no"/>sage from which it can be inferred that he [Milton] was
<lb/>an Arian.” Here we entirely disagree with the compiler.
<lb/>The “Paradise Lost” abounds in such passages. Dr.
<lb/>Griswold’s Introduction is, nevertheless, well written
<lb/>and well adapted to its purposes. At points, however,
<lb/>it may be thought extravagant or dogmatic. We have
<lb/>no patience with the initial sneer at Bacon, as “the mean-
<lb break="no"/>est of mankind.” These assertions are passes, and a
<lb/>truly profound philosophy might readily prove them ill
<lb/>based. We would undertake to show, à priori, that no
<lb/>man, with Bacon’s thorough appreciation of the true and
<lb/>beautiful, could, by any possibility, be “the meanest,”
<lb/>although his very sensibility might make him the weak-
<lb break="no"/>est “ of mankind.”</p><p></p><p>When Dr. Griswold, in conclusion, terms Milton “ the
<lb/>greatest of all human beings,” we really do think that
<lb/>he should have appended the words—“ in the opinion, at
<lb/>least, of Dr. Griswold.”</p><p></p><p>But these things are trifles. An important service has
<lb/>been rendered to our Letters, and he who renders it is
<lb/>entitled to thanks. The volumes are well printed and
<lb/>bound, and no one, pretending to even ordinary scholar-
<lb break="no"/>ship, can afford to do without them.</p><p></p><p>Wiley &amp; Putnam’s Library of American Books, No. V.—
<lb/>Big Abel and the Little Manhattan. By Cornelius Ma-
<lb break="no"/>thews.</p><p></p><p>The conception and execution of this book are both
<lb/>original. The narrative (if such it may be termed) forms
<lb/>merely the upper current of the true theme which flows
<lb/>below. The principal object is that of a suggestive par-
<lb break="no"/>allel between the present and primitive condition of the
<lb/>Island of Manhattan. A secondary purpose is that of
<lb/>gossip about the New-York localities and customs—es-
<lb break="no"/>pecially those appertaining to the terrae incognitae of
<lb/>remote districts, such as the East Bowery. The ostensi-
<lb break="no"/>ble theme has reference to the adventures of a great
<lb/>grandson of Hudson, the navigator, and the heir of the
<lb/>last chief of the Manhattanese. These worthies are sup-</p><p><pb n="178" break="no" />
</p><p>posed to institute, or to contemplate instituting, in the
<lb/>“ Supreme Court of Judicature,” a claim against the
<lb/>Corporation of New-York, for the whole of its territory.
<lb/>Imbued with a strong prospective sense of their title, the
<lb/>claimants are represented as vagabondizing through the
<lb/>island, partitioning between them the property that is to
<lb/>be theirs upon the decision of the suit. It is their divi-
<lb break="no"/>sion of the spoils which affords opportunity for the
<lb/>suggestive parallel between the savage and the civilized
<lb/>condition. Big Abel’s attention is arrested, and his cupid-
<lb break="no"/>ity excited, by everything appertaining to commerce and
<lb/>modern usage. He claims, for example, the shipping,
<lb/>the markets, the banks, and the coffee-houses. The Lit-
<lb break="no"/>tle Manhattan has an eye to the fountains, the squares,
<lb/>and the Indian figures at the tobacco-shop doors. The
<lb/>conversation of the two claimants is little in itself—but
<lb/>is full of a delicate and skillful innuendo, which, indeed,
<lb/>is the staple of the book. An episode relating to a Poor
<lb/>Scholar and his mistress, serves well as an introduction
<lb/>for many touches of a homely or domestic pathos, in il-
<lb break="no"/>lustration of local details.</p><p></p><p>The book, upon the whole, does great credit to its au-
<lb break="no"/>thor. The conception is forcible and unique. Much skill
<lb/>is evinced in the general construction and conduct. The
<lb/>allegory is properly subdued. Many points evince acute
<lb/>observation, and a keen sense of the more delicate humor.
<lb/>There are also some passages of rich imagination. The
<lb/>style is nervous, but (intentionally) loose or abrupt, and
<lb/>has an original and, therefore, impressive effect. The great
<lb/>defect of the work is indefiniteness. The design is not

<lb break="no"/>nications, made by its author to “The Churchman,” dur-

<lb/>harsh and unwearied cavils against Episcopalians.” A
<lb/>large portion of the work, however, is entirely new.—
<lb/>Some remarkable quotations preface the volume. The
<lb/>first of them is “Milton was a Puritan,” from Leonard
<lb/>Bacon’s Hist. Disc. Then follow three extracts from Mil-
<lb break="no"/>ton’s Prose Works—extracts in opposition to Puritanism.
<lb/>A Note afterwards, says :—“ An intelligent reader will
<lb/>not be surprised to learn that the Puritans have succeed-
<lb break="no"/>ed in suppressing the above passages, with a number like
<lb/>them, in most of the editions of Milton.” This is a se-
<lb break="no"/>rious charge—and not more serious than true. A very

<lb/>Relations of Texas, Mexico, and the United States.
<lb/>By Gen. Thomas J. Green. Illustrated by Drawings
<lb/>taken from Life by Charles M'Laughlin, a Fellow-Pris-
<lb break="no"/>oner. New York: Harper and Brothers.</p><p></p><p>This work was prepared for the press soon after the
<lb/>writer’s escape from the castle of Perote, but has been
<lb/>kept back through fear of injuring the Texians detained,
<lb/>until recently, prisoners of war in Mexico.</p><p></p><p>The title fully conveys the general design ;—the narra-
<lb break="no"/>tive in the author’s own words, is one “of Texian daring,
<lb/>of battles lost and won, of dungeons and old castles, of
<lb/>imprisonment and hair-breadth escapes, of unparalleled
<lb/>sufferings and cruel murders.” No one can take up the
<lb/>book without becoming thoroughly interested in its details.
<lb/>The reflections on the political relations of Mexico, Tex-
<lb break="no"/>as and the U. States, are if not profound, at least acute,
<lb/>and we listen to them with respectful attention, as the
<lb/>views of an evidently sincere man, and one whose exten-
<lb break="no"/>sive personal experience entitles him to speak, on many
<lb/>points, with authority.</p><p></p><p>By way of instancing the general manner of the book,
<lb/>we quote a passage giving an account of the escape from
<lb/>Perote:</p><p></p><p>John Toowig was a son of Old Ireland, a small, energetic man,
<lb/>and a true-hearted Republican. His size and energy both befitting
<lb/>the operation in the hole, he had done more than his share of the
<lb/>work. He was the same who, in the spring of 1842, at San Anto-
<lb break="no"/>nio, put a match to a keg of powder and blew up his store, with
<lb/>several thousand dollars worth of goods, rather than they should
<lb/>fall into the hands of the Mexican General Vascus. It was less
<lb/>difficult for him than some others to get through the perforation in
<lb/>the wall. I found much difficulty in passing through, though I
<lb/>was now reduced from one hundred and sixty pounds, my usual
<lb/>weight, to one hundred and twenty. The gradual funnel-shape of
<lb/>the breach made it like driving a pin into an auger-hole, for the
<lb/>deeper we went, the closer the fit. The smallest of us having gone
<lb/>through first, for fear that the largest might hang in the hole and
<lb/>stop it up, it now came to Stone’s turn, who was a large man.</p><p></p><p>He hung fast, and could neither get backward nor forward. In
<lb/>this situation, being wedged in as fast as his giant strength could
<lb/>force him, our friends on the inside of the room, who had been as-
<lb break="no"/>sisting us, had to reach in the hole, tie ropes to his hands, and draw
<lb/>him back. This operation was very like drawing his arms out of</p><p><pb n="179"/>
</p><p>his body, but did not satisfy him. “ I have a wife and children at
<lb/>home,” says he, “ and I would rather die than stay here longer: I
<lb/>will go through, or leave no skin upon my bones." So saying, he
<lb/>disrobed himself: his very great exertion, causing him to perspire
<lb/>freely, answered nearly as well for the second effort as if he had
<lb/>been greased, and he went through after the most powerful labour
<lb/>leaving both skin and flesh behind.</p><p></p><p>John Young, if anything, was a larger man than Stone, but was
<lb/>much his junior in years: he was as supple as a snake, and no
<lb/>Roman gladiator ever exhibited more perfectly-formed muscles:
<lb/>nor was his determined temper in bad keeping with his physical
<lb/>conformation. He was the last that came out; and while the bal-
<lb break="no"/>ance of us sat under the side of the wall, we feared that it would
<lb/>be impossible for him to get through. Presently, with the aid of a
<lb/>dim sky above us, we saw his feet slowly protruding, then his
<lb/>knees, and when he came to his hip joints, here for many minutes
<lb/>he hung last. When this part of his body was cleared, the angu-
<lb break="no"/>lar use of his knees gave him additional purchase to work by; but
<lb/>still our boys said, " Poor fellow ! it will be impossible to gel his
<lb/>muscular arms and shoulders through.” We sat under him with
<lb/>an agony of feeling not to be described, while he ceased not his
<lb/>efforts. His body was now cleared to his shoulders, but still he
<lb/>hung fast. Having the full purchase of his legs, he would writhe,
<lb/>first up and down, and then from side to side, with Herculean
<lb/>strength; and when he disengaged himself, if it was not like the
<lb/>drawing of a cork from a porter-bottle, it was with the low, sullen,
<lb/>determined growl of a lion.</p><p></p><p>Being now through our greatest difficulty about the castle, we
<lb/>adjusted carefully, though silently, our knapsacks and blankets,
<lb/>passing orders from one to another in low whispers, which were in-
<lb break="no"/>terrupted alone by the almost perpetual cry of “centinela alerta"
<lb/>of the sentinels above us, both upon the right and left bastions, and
<lb/>between which we had now to pass. The moon had gone down at
<lb/>8 o'clock; and being favoured by the darkness in the bottom of the
<lb/>moat, through which the sentinels overhead could not penetrate, we
<lb/>slowly crossed over to the outer wall in Indian file, then felt along
<lb/>the wall until we came to a flight of narrow steps eighteen inches
<lb/>wide, up which we crawled upon all-fours. When we reached the
<lb/>top of the wall, which formed the outer side of the moat, we passed
<lb/>on to the chevaux de frize, which was about twelve feet high, of
<lb/>pointed timbers set upright in the ground. These upright timbers
<lb/>passed through a horizontal sill about six feet from the ground,
<lb/>which we could reach with our hands, and then pull ourselves up,
<lb/>from which we could then climb over the sharp points of the up-
<lb break="no"/>right posts, thence down to the bottom of the outside ditch, up the
<lb/>outside bank of which we crawled, it not being walled. When
<lb/>we reached the lop we breathed more freely, for we were now in
<lb/>the wide world, and felt more like freemen; and as the sentinels
<lb/>drolled out their sleepy notes of " centinela alerta,” we jumped up,
<lb/>and cracked our heels together three times, as a substitute for
<lb/>cheers three times three.</p><p>The volume is beautifully printed and bound—a large

<lb break="no"/>pleton &amp; Co.</p><p></p><p>This is a well printed octavo of more than 500 pages,
<lb/>and is based upon the volume of “ Arnold’s Miscellaneous
<lb/>Works” published in London, June 1845; in which, how-
<lb break="no"/>ever there were many important omissions as well as re-
<lb break="no"/>dundancies. In the American edition (now issued) the
<lb/>former are supplied and the latter avoided. The “Frag-
<lb break="no"/>ment on the Church”; the “ Essay on Church and State”
<lb/>and the “ Christian Life, its Course, its Hindrances and
<lb/>its Helps” will be found in this the American, but not in
<lb/>the English edition. The “ Christian Life” is, in fact,
<lb/>absolutely necessary for the proper understanding of many
<lb/>other essays, in which allusion or reference is made to it.
<lb/>Besides these papers, we have, in the way of addition,
<lb/>“The Church of England”; “Early Roman History”;
<lb/>“ Faith and Reason”; “ The Oxford Malignants and Dr.
<lb/>Hampden”; “ The Sixth Chapter of the Gospel by John”;
<lb/>“Tracts for the Times”; and “Tradition”—the whole
<lb/>including 256 pages, or one half the present volume.</p><p></p><p>The articles omitted are merely ephemeral composi-
<lb break="no"/>tions never meant for preservation—letters from old news-
<lb break="no"/>papers, and other similar matter of a purely local or temp-
<lb break="no"/>orary character, but constituting nearly one fourth of the
<lb/>English edition, in which the main object appears to
<lb/>have been the making of a book sufficiently bulky to sell
<lb/>at a certain price.</p><p></p><p>Some other improvements have been effected; as re-
<lb break="no"/>gards for example, the arrangement of matter; and the
<lb/>work, upon the whole, cannot fail to be highly acceptable

<lb/>our readers—a series whose subject (The Wrongs of

<lb/>except those interested in the persecutions which it will

<lb/>and the greater portion of it is absolutely true—the names
<lb/>of the parties only being changed. We hope every ho-

<lb/>bound duodecimo volumes, as the first number of a new
<lb/>series of Standard Books which they intend to issue under
<lb/>the general title of “ Harper’s New Miscellany.” If
<lb/>this work is to be regarded as, in any sense, a specimen of
<lb/>the scries, we have no hesitation in saying that it will be
<lb/>by far the most useful and important Library of its kind
<lb/>ever published in this country. Prof. Whewell is very
<lb/>widely known as a writer upon Moral Science of the most
<lb/>profound ability. He stands, indeed, at the head of the
<lb/>living philosophical professors in England, and his work
<lb/>on the Inductive Sciences is universally regarded as of the
<lb/>very highest authority.</p><p></p><p>In this work on Morality, which has but just been pub-
<lb break="no"/>lished in England in two large octavo volumes, after a se-
<lb break="no"/>ries of very full and exact elementary notices and defini-
<lb break="no"/>tions, he has laid down, in a manner far more complete,
<lb/>precise and methodical than any former writer, the Laws
<lb/>of Morality as applied to every department of individual,
<lb/>social, political and ecclesiastical action. The nature,
<lb/>obligations and rights of Society,—Divine Laws and their
<lb/>Sanction,—the idea, rights, deties and obligations of the
<lb/>State,—the nature of Oaths, of International Law &amp;c. &amp;c.
<lb/>are discussed in the most full, systematic and satisfactory
<lb/>manner. The work can hardly fail to become a text book
<lb/>in all our colleges and higher schools :—but we are also
<lb/>glad that it has been published in such a form and at so
<lb/>cheap a price, as must insure its universal circulation. It
<lb/>is a work which deserves to be studied by every citizen of
<lb/>this republic.</p><p></p><p>The two volumes contain over 400 pages each,—closely
<lb/>and yet very distinctly printed upon fine, white paper, and
<lb/>are substantially and elegantly bound in muslin, gilt, and
<lb/>sold at fifty cents a volume. This is to be the style and
<lb/>price of all the succeeding volumes of the Miscellany,
<lb/>which will contain important historical, scientific, bio-
<lb break="no"/>graphical and other works. The publishers, in their pro-
<lb break="no"/>spectus, state that the main, controlling aim of the entire
<lb/>collection, will be instruction rather than amusement.
<lb/>Such a series of books is greatly needed:—and we hazard
<lb/>little in saying that this will prove the most useful, if not
<lb/>the most popular Library ever issued in this country.</p><p></p><p>Pictorial History of the World. By John Frost, LL.D.

The Fairy's Burial
The Fairy’s burial!
Starlight, the pall —
Starlight so bright:
Bright shone the stars above,—
Emblems of peace and love,—
Eyes of the night.
Sad were the fairies, then,
Coming from hill and glen;—
Sadly they came ;
One, from the fairy throne,
Had now forever flown—
No more to reign.
Death and his brother Sleep
Now the young fairy keep,
Voiceless and still;
Low lies the fairy now,—
She of the golden brow—
She of the laughing rill.
Oh!’t was a sadening sight—
Wreathed in the lilies white,
Calmly she lay.
Ah ! ’t was a lovely flower,
Called from the fairies bower—
Withered away.
Made they the fairy’s grave,
Near to the dancing wave,
Singing its song,
Ringing their silvery knells
Sighing their wild farewells—
Sad fairy throng!
Floateth a silvery sound;
Over the flower-clad ground.
Softly they steal.
Fays from the fairy-land,
Led by an angel-hand—
Sweetly they kneel:
Music floats sweetly there,
Borne on the rosy air.
Music so still—
Warbled from flowery dell,
Floating from fairy shell—
Wildly doth thrill.
Robed in the starlight fair,
Wreathed in their golden hair,
Stars gleaming bright.
Fairies in beauty come,
Guarding the young fay’s tomb,
Through the lone night.

</p><p>Oratorio or the Seven Sleepers.—The Tabernacle
<lb/>was densely crowded on Thursday evening, the 18th inst.
<lb/>We have rarely seen so large an audience gathered to-
<lb break="no"/>gether ; there must have been over three thousand per-
<lb break="no"/>sons present. The production of an Oratorio, by a com-
<lb break="no"/>poser of great merit, for the first time in this country,
<lb/>could scarcely fail to attract much attention among the
<lb/>people generally, but more especially among the lovers
<lb/>of fine Sacred Music, of which there is a large class in</p><p><pb n="181"/>
</p><p>and about the city. More than ordinary attention, how-
<lb break="no"/>ever, was given to the announcement of the forthcoming
<lb/>work, from the fact that the gentleman under whose di-
<lb break="no"/>rection it was to be produced, was known to be always
<lb/>the most forward in the cause of sterling music, and had
<lb/>proved himself, beyond a doubt, the most competent lead-
<lb break="no"/>er in the country. Every confidence was therefore placed
<lb/>upon his skill and judgment, and the public went to the
<lb/>Tabernacle, fully assured that they would meet with an
<lb/>intellectual entertainment. Their expectations were ful-
<lb break="no"/>filled.</p><p>The following is a cast of the characters:
Antipater, (Proconsul at Ephesus,)         Mr. S. Pearson.
Honoria, (his wife,) -	Mrs. Strong.
Martinus, (Bishop of Ephesus,)              Mr. S. P. Cheney.
Malchus,......................   Mrs. Edward Loder.
Serapion, ----- Miss Cheney.
Johannes,	-	-	-	-	-	Miss DeLuce.
Constantine, ...	-  Mr. John Johnson.

</p><p>The plan of the Oratorio we detailed in our paper a
<lb/>week or two since. It is of so purely dramatic a char-
<lb break="no"/>acter, that much of the interest it would otherwise excite
<lb/>is lost for want of scenic effect and dresses appropriate.
<lb/>A most magnificent Sacred Opera could be formed from
<lb/>the Oratorio of the Seven Sleepers: far superior to Da-
<lb break="no"/>vid ; it would equal in effect, we think, Rossini’s Israel-
<lb break="no"/>ites in Egypt. What could be more effective, for instance,
<lb/>than the whole of the second act—the High Priest bles-
<lb break="no"/>sing the banner of the soldiers, who are going forth to
<lb/>fight the enemies of the Cross—the people, in throngs,
<lb/>crowding to witness the ceremony. Malchus, the young-
<lb break="no"/>est of the Seven Sleepers, enters in the midst; he gazes
<lb/>around him in wild amazement!—it is not Ephesus he
<lb/>beholds—the people are not the same—the symbol of the
<lb/>Cross waves everywhere triumphant, while yesternight,
<lb/>as he supposes, the infidel held sway over all. His
<lb/>strange dress, and yet stranger manners, attract the at-
<lb break="no"/>tention of the people. They believe him to be a spy—
<lb/>they seize and bear him before a Roman Consul, who exam-
<lb break="no"/>ines and extracts from him his strange and incredible story.
<lb/>The people believe it to be a miracle of the Most High,
<lb/>and with an eagerness which cannot be restrained, they
<lb/>tush towards Mount Celion. In all this there is vivid ac-
<lb break="no"/>tion, and aided by scenery, dresses, and by the music,
<lb/>which is descriptive to an extraordinary degree, would
<lb/>form, we believe, a scene of thrilling excitement.</p><p></p><p>The Music itself denotes unmistakeably the class to
<lb/>which it belongs. We have said that it is descriptive,
<lb/>and it is not partially so, but every feature in the plot
<lb/>has its appropriate music :—pastoral, martial, solemn and
<lb/>agitated. But there is one striking feature in the compo-
<lb break="no"/>sition which strikes us as a marvellously fine thought.—
<lb/>Between the time at which the Brothers fell asleep, and
<lb/>the period of their waking, two hundred years are sup-
<lb break="no"/>posed to have elapsed. The two periods are distinctly
<lb/>Marked by the music. While the Brothers chaunt forth
<lb/>a solemn chorale, quaint, crude, and almost harsh in
<lb/>its character, the people of Ephesus sing in a more
<lb/>Modern style. The contrast is most strongly marked, and
<lb/>the effect is striking and peculiar. This admirable
<lb/>thought would alone stamp the genius of the composer.
<lb/>Of the music itself we must record our honest admira-
<lb break="no"/>tion. Looking at it, as an Oratorio, we should complain
<lb/>of a want of dignity, solidity and grandeur    It lacks the</p><p></p><p>elements of the sublime ; there is too great a mingling
<lb/>of the petty passions and worldly strife, with the solemn
<lb/>thoughts which should be absorbed in contemplating the
<lb/>miracles vouchsafed by the Almighty. But as a Sacred
<lb/>Drama, we do not hesitate to say that the Seven Sleep-
<lb break="no"/>ers is the very highest of its class. Judging it in this
<lb/>light, we take a lowlier standard, and the composition
<lb/>rises in our estimation. The music allotted to the Seven
<lb/>Brothers ranks foremost in point of excellence. A quiet,
<lb/>dreamy and yet solemn feeling pervades each successive
<lb/>piece. The first piece, commencing “ Lord God our re-
<lb break="no"/>fuge,” in which the voices join in in rotation, beginning
<lb/>with Maximianus and ending with Malchus, is truly an
<lb/>awakening from a deep slumber ; and the last piece, com-
<lb break="no"/>mencing with the line, “ Now with unseen wings ap-
<lb break="no"/>proaching,” in which the same figure is reversed, is as
<lb/>truly the gradual approach of their second and last slum-
<lb break="no"/>ber. In short, the music of the Brothers forms a musi-
<lb break="no"/>cal pyramid, of which Malchus is the apex, and Maximi-
<lb break="no"/>anus is the base. A more perfect musical figure it is im-
<lb break="no"/>possible to conceive. The music given to Malchus is
<lb/>undoubtedly the most charming in the Oratorio; its sim-
<lb break="no"/>plicity is marvellous, and its melody is of the most chaste
<lb/>and pleasing character. The Aria of Johannes ranks
<lb/>next in point of beauty ; its gravity impresses one sensi-
<lb break="no"/>bly, while its simplicity and pathos enhance the impres-
<lb break="no"/>sion. Martinus (the Bishop) is entrusted with some
<lb/>grand and imposing music, particularly the Aria in
<lb/>the third part. Antipater and Honoria have much to
<lb/>do, yet, though their music is very charming, it fails in
<lb/>exciting interest when compared with the other char-
<lb break="no"/>acters. The chorusses, judged by the standard we have
<lb/>established, are fine compositions ; the fugues, judged by
<lb/>any standard, must be acknowledged as masterly com-
<lb break="no"/>positions, but they are designed, with the exception of the
<lb/>last, to represent action, and require action to take off the
<lb/>appearance of scientific elaboration.</p><p></p><p>The instrumentation is exceedingly beautiful, although,
<lb/>with several exceptions, it is decidedly operatic. There
<lb/>are many charming combinations and exquisite points
<lb/>throughout the work ; the partitions of the several fugues
<lb/>are really striking examples of ingenuity and knowledge
<lb/>applied to the Orchestra, and the accompaniments to the
<lb/>Bishop’s Music are particularly happy in producing the
<lb/>effect of grandeur and dignity.</p><p></p><p>On the whole, it is undoubtedly a great work—great
<lb/>in its simplicity, great in its elaboration, great in its con-
<lb break="no"/>ception, and great in its execution. We have not entered
<lb/>as fully into its beauties as we could wish; but we trust
<lb/>we have said enough to draw the attention of ameteurs
<lb/>to its merits.</p><p></p><p>From Mrs. E. Loder, as Malchus, much was expected,
<lb/>and the expectations were fulfilled. She sang the music
<lb/>throughout most admirably. In her recitatives especially,
<lb/>she displayed the striking advantage of a thorough musi-
<lb break="no"/>cal education. Every word was distinctly enunciated,
<lb/>and each point was delivered with proper emphasis.—
<lb/>Her solos were executed with a chasteness of expression
<lb/>and a purity of style, which are the distinguishing char-
<lb break="no"/>acteristics of the school. It was loudly and deservedly
<lb/>applauded.</p><p></p><p>Mrs. Strong sang the music of Honoria very sweetly.
<lb/>Her style is somewhat too cold, and her delivery wants
<lb/>the freedom of a practised artist; but in her execution she
<lb/>has very much improved since we last heard her. Her
<lb/>music, as we have before remarked, is the least pleasing,</p><p><pb n="182"/>
</p><p>or, at all events, the least effective, in the Oratorio; but
<lb/>the melody of her voice added much to its interest and
<lb/>effect.</p><p></p><p>Miss Cheney had but little to do, and that little was
<lb/>mostly concerted. It would not, therefore, be fair to
<lb/>form a judgment upon her capacities.</p><p></p><p>Miss De Luce, as Johannes, acquitted herself exceed-
<lb break="no"/>ingly well. She has a mezzo soprano voice of a most
<lb/>lovely quality—rich, full and melodious. It tells wonder-
<lb break="no"/>fully in any piece of moderate movement, requiring sus-
<lb break="no"/>tained expression. Miss De Luce sang the air, “God be
<lb/>with you,” in a chaste and careful manner. She began a
<lb/>little flat, which was evidently caused by extreme fright;
<lb/>for as soon as this abated, the fault was no longer visible.
<lb/>If this young lady should study seriously, she could not
<lb/>fail to attain a high position in her profession.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Sidney Pearson was the Antipater of the evening,
<lb/>We were both pleased and surprised at the excellence of
<lb/>his performance. He has many faults ; his pronunciation
<lb/>is broad and inelegant—his intonation is by no means fault-
<lb break="no"/>less; and he lacks passion and expression. But he sang his
<lb/>music correctly, attempted no interpolations, and was on
<lb/>the whole, perhaps, as good a representative of the char-
<lb break="no"/>acter as could be found in the city.</p><p></p><p>Messrs. Bennett and Cheney are Amateurs. They have
<lb/>both good voices, but the want of education in every re-
<lb break="no"/>spect is so glaringly apparent, that criticism would be use-
<lb break="no"/>less. Of the two, however, Mr. Cheney has decidedly the
<lb/>advantage in point of voice and intonation. A year’s study
<lb/>under careful direction, would place Mr. Cheney in a good
<lb/>position as a singer of Sacred Music.</p><p></p><p>The Chorusses were performed in a style of excellence
<lb/>truly remarkable. The Choral performances of the Sa-
<lb break="no"/>cred Music Society have always been noted for want of
<lb/>precision, firmness, power, and capability to produce due
<lb/>effects. But on this occasion the same materials were em-
<lb break="no"/>ployed (nearly all the Chorus singers being members of
<lb/>the S. M. S.) yet none of these defects were in any part to
<lb/>be observed. Every point was taken up with admirable
<lb/>precision ; the pianos were duly cared for, and the cres-
<lb break="no"/>cendos were truly grand in their effects. The only visi-
<lb break="no"/>ble want, was a want of power, and this want could only
<lb/>be remedied by an increase of members, which under the
<lb/>circumstances could not be obtained. A striking fact might
<lb/>be elicited were we to pursue the enquiry as to the cause
<lb/>of the marked difference in the performance of the same
<lb/>people upon this occasion and upon previous occasions.
<lb/>We will, however, leave our readers to draw the inference
<lb/>themselves.</p><p></p><p>The instrumental performance was equally remarkable
<lb/>for its excellence. The Band was kept in admirable sub-
<lb break="no"/>jection to the voices, and the recitatives were better ac-
<lb break="no"/>companied than we have ever heard before in this coun-
<lb break="no"/>try. The band was also deficient in power, not through
<lb/>any meanness on the part of those engaged in producing 
<lb/>the work, but from the fact that most of the good instru-
<lb break="no"/>mental performers of the city, were engaged at the sever-
<lb break="no"/>al Theatres.</p><p></p><p>At the next representation which will be on the 9th of
<lb/>October, greater facilities will undoubtedly be available,
<lb/>and the only want observable in the performance will then
<lb/>be remarked.</p><p></p><p>We must repeat the praise which we awarded Mr. Lo-
<lb break="no"/>der at the commencement of the notice ; for to his skill,
<lb/>judgment and firmness, must be attributed all the excel-
<lb break="no"/>lence which we have described.</p><p></p><p>We must also compliment Mr. Timm upon the artist-
<lb break="no"/>like manner in which he introduced the Organ, and brought
<lb/>its full power to bear upon those points where it could tell
<lb/>with the best effect. He proved himself indeed a worthy
<lb/>coadjutor of the talented conductor.</p><p></p><p>We have yet a word or two to say about the public-spir-
<lb break="no"/>ited gentleman at whose individual risk the whole per-
<lb break="no"/>formance was got up. Mr. Henry Meigs, is known to the
<lb/>public as former Secretary of the New York Sacred Mu-
<lb break="no"/>sic Society. We presume he felt the insufficiency of that
<lb/>Society, under its present management, to produce any-
<lb break="no"/>thing but those works at which they have been drum-
<lb break="no"/>ming for years, without attaining any point beyond res-
<lb break="no"/>pectable mediocrity. Acting upon this feeling, he deter-
<lb break="no"/>mined to produce, at his own expense, a work of standard
<lb/>merit, never before performed in this city, in the best style
<lb/>that money could command. He determined also that be-
<lb break="no"/>sides benefiting the public by his undertaking, he would
<lb/>also benefit the resident professors:—a singular determin-
<lb break="no"/>ation, we allow, as the very last thought in the minds of the
<lb/>projectors of any Musical undertaking, is to consider that
<lb/>class which is most worthy of consideration. Mr. Meigs
<lb/>consulted his conductor, and the Oratorio of the Seven
<lb/>Sleepers was chosen. No sooner did the “ Society” gain
<lb/>information of the fact, than they acted the part of Many
<lb/>Sleepers Awakened, (from a long sleep too,) and decided
<lb/>upon producing the work in opposition to this individual
<lb/>enterprize. This was certainly somewhat unworthy of an
<lb/>incorporated Society ; but we must excuse them, from the
<lb/>fact that they were rather roughly awakened, and had
<lb/>hardly time to rub their eyes before they decided upon a
<lb/>course of action.</p><p></p><p>A large proportion of the Society joined Mr. Meigs in
<lb/>his undertaking, without however withdrawing from the
<lb/>Society, and to these ladies and gentlemen, who scorned to
<lb/>endure the trammels which would serve to keep music
<lb/>back a hundred years, the thanks of the public and the
<lb/>profession are due. How well they acquitted themselves
<lb/>the thousands who were present can testify.</p><p></p><p>We call upon the public to support Mr. Meigs in his
<lb/>undertaking, for upon their support the success or the fail-
<lb break="no"/>ure of every undertaking depends; we call upon the pub-
<lb break="no"/>lic to come forward, not to benefit the individual, but the
<lb/>Art: for the success of this undertaking will ensure the
<lb/>production of a series of standard classical works, which
<lb/>cannot be produced through any other agency.</p><p></p><p>Park Theatre.—Opera is still the rage at this estab-
<lb break="no"/>lishment. Miss Delcy, since our last, has appeared in
<lb/>the character of Cinderella, and as Zerlina in Fra Diavolo.
<lb/>She has gained considerably in public estimation, and
<lb/>will, we are confident, become a great favorite ; for a gen-
<lb break="no"/>erous public will always stand forward in defence of a
<lb/>woman, especially if she be as young and as pretty as
<lb/>Miss Delcy, against hired critics and interested profession-
<lb break="no"/>al slanderers. We have seen no reason to alter our ex-
<lb break="no"/>pressed opinion of Miss Delcy’s powers, but we still say
<lb/>that she is full of promise for the future, and has many
<lb/>advantages over some who have occupied, for several
<lb/>years, the situation she now holds. We trust that the
<lb/>public will give her a fair chance, and hope she may con-
<lb break="no"/>tinue successful.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Gardner has proved the truth of our remarks in
<lb/>every respect. As soon as he shall have recovered the
<lb/>full power of his voice, which has been temporarily dis-
<lb break="no"/>arranged, from the combined effect of the sea voyage and</p><p><pb n="183"/>
change of climate, we insure for him a good share of the
public approbation.
</p><p>Miss Moss acquitted herself, as Lady Allwash, exceed-
<lb break="no"/>ingly well, both in her singing and her acting, and Mr.
<lb/>Brough, as Beppo, was perfectly correct in his music
<lb/>throughout, and has some difficult and catchy bits to
<lb/>sing. He is evidently becoming pains-taking, and we are
<lb/>glad to see and hear it.</p><p>Want of space precludes the possibility of our length-

Criticisms on the Popular Errors of the Age.
NO. I.
Is Error dead, since, as the Teuton* found,
’Twas not the Sun, but Earth, that whirled around?
Or reason fixed, because by Bacon’s spell
The schoolmen, heaps on heaps, confounded fell?
Is science sure, since Black or Davy tried,
Air to create, and water to divide ?
Nay—when the Prince of Peace, his flag unfurled,
Was truth, at once, triumphant o’er the world?
I wot that ancient Erebus doth still
New hydras hatch as fast as truth can kill,
Sending fresh broods, with horns and talons rife.
To chase mankind, and glut their rage on life.
Else, why this seven-years’-tempest—mad in looks,
Of teachers, doctors, reasoners,—men and books,
All fierce with zeal—all eloquent to show
What fools there lived a hundred years ago.
See B-----h —ah B------h hath o’er his ivied head,*
The shield of lettered honors strongly spread.
Ensconced in Hebrew—redolent to tell
How by a dagesh many a meaning fell,
Or by a rule—an old and honored rule—
One writer in, ranks fifty out of school.
But school or no school, sacerdotal wit
Hath on his page its golden plaudit writ.
Hath he not found—a thing for Paul too vast,—
The Resurrection is already past?
Is it not clear that he who dies is dead
Foot, hand and heart, nerves, cerebrum and head,
And one and all, with an eternal “ must”
Are doomed to “dissipate” in gas and dust ?
Can “that” again arise? Pray, who shall find
His body in the earth, or leaves, or wind ?
Whoever dies is dead by an “election,”
And spirits only, feel the resurrection.
Sir, Christ arose, and took his “body” too, [2.]
But that might be to balk the raging Jew [A.]
Yet he ate meat, all doubt to disenthrone [2.)
And prove that he was veritable flesh and bone.
The doctor took the pulpit at this point,
Pride in his heart, but fear in every joint.
“Such facts may answer well a trustful church,
“But leave philosophy quite in the lurch.
“Give crowds strong faith, they want but little knowledge.
“I write for reason, honors, and a college.
</p><p>“But ’tis not reason, I should so dilute
<lb/>“My thoughts, each vague objector to refute
<lb/>"And draw my tenets out so very thin,</p><p>"That common minds should grasp me, and refine.
“Viewed by a subtil neologic light,
“My treatise and the scriptures both are right.”
So closed the sermon. People sat in doubt,
While snatching up his hat, the Dean walked out.

Editorial Miscellany.
</p><p>In our notice, last week, of an article on “American
<lb/>Humor” by Mr. William Jones, we mentioned that Mr.
<lb/>Graham, the editor of “ Graham’s Magazine,” had re-
<lb break="no"/>jected a contribution from Mr. Jones ; and we gave this
<lb/>as our only supposable reason for the latter’s sweeping
<lb/>denunciation of the three-dollar Magazines. We have
<lb/>since received, from a warm personal friend of Mr. Jones,
<lb/>a somewhat different version of the story—which runs
<lb/>thus:</p><p></p><p>A contract was entered into by “ Graham’s Magazine” for seve-
<lb break="no"/>ral articles from the pen of Mr. Jones. The articles were writ-
<lb break="no"/>ten ; they did not suit the tone of the Magazine (which might
<lb/>have been a virtue or not in the contributor, according to the sub-
<lb break="no"/>ject matter): some delay occurred; but the negotiation was ulti-
<lb break="no"/>mately completed, according to the agreement, by Mr. Graham
<lb/>paying the author.</p><p></p><p>We are happy to afford Mr. Jones the full benefit of
<lb/>this variation. Our own opinion of the matter is not ma-
<lb break="no"/>terially changed. When a critic so far forgets himself
<lb/>as to speak in wholesale terms of disparagement of a
<lb/>work made up altogether of contributions from the elite
<lb/>of our literature, we naturally seek some unusual reason
<lb/>for the abuse—some reason which does not appear upon
<lb/>the surface—in short, some private and personal cause.—
<lb/>If we have wronged Mr. Jones, we regret it very sincere-
<lb break="no"/>ly—although he has made no scruple of wronging us and
<lb/>our friends. Still, we by no means think that we have
<lb/>wronged Mr. Jones.</p><p>His apologist (for whom personally and as an author,
we have the highest respect) goes on to say :
</p><p>Whatever sins of dogmatism Mr. J. may have to answer for,
<lb/>(and we must still regret that his last article was not submitted to
<lb/>a judicious pruning and emendation) we are assured that he is
<lb/>utterly incapable of any of the prevalent sins of literary immorali-
<lb break="no"/>ty. True men of letters are not so abundant in the community as</p><p>to be wantonly injured in their good fame......Mr. Jones is
</p><p>an individual writer of the dogmatic school, who requires for a
<lb/>subject one strictly in harmony with his sentiment and experience,
<lb/>when he is enthusiastic, brilliant, and profound: out of his per-
<lb break="no"/>sonal range he is careless, ineffective, and apparently unjust.</p><p></p><p>The article upon Mr. Dana, written by Mr. Jones and published
<lb/>in an early number of this [The Broadway] Journal, exhibits him
<lb/>in his true element.</p><p></p><p>With much of all this we agree. Mr. Jones is what
<lb/>may be termed an “ elegant” essayist of a by-gone school.
<lb/>His articles are always graceful, pointed, gentlemanly,
<lb/>in thought and tone. They lack vigor, originality, and
<lb/>consecutiveness. They leave no definite impression.—
<lb/>We read one of them and say—not that .we have been
<lb/>convinced of anything, or that we have derived any new
<lb/>ideas—but that, upon the whole, Mr. Jones is a very cle-</p><p></p><p>ver writer of essays. His most reprehensible fault, how-
<lb break="no"/>ever, is that he can see nothing excellent out of the lim-
<lb break="no"/>its of Boston Common. Again:—if we have done him
<lb/>injustice, we beg his pardon—but we do not think that
<lb/>we have.</p><p>Hon. Edward Everett and family returned home in

<lb/>called to those beautiful instruments, manufactured by J.
<lb/>F. Browne, 281 Broadway and 83 Chambers street.</p><p></p><p>The Harp, as an instrument, is but little known in this
<lb/>country, although in Europe it is considered as a necessary
<lb/>accomplishment to ladies of refined education, occupying
<lb/>any position in fashionable society. It is a singular fact,
<lb/>but it is no less true than singular, that while the ladies of
<lb/>the South, particularly of Charleston and New Orleans,
<lb/>cultivate a knowledge of this instrument with considera-
<lb break="no"/>ble success, our Northern ladies display a marked indif-
<lb break="no"/>ference on the subject. Were we inclined to write an
<lb/>essay upon the history of the Harp, we might say how it
<lb/>flourished thousands of years before the Christian Era—
<lb/>we might trace its course down to that period and through
<lb/>the Dark Ages (when it survived most other instruments)
<lb/>even up to the present time—we might describe its vari-
<lb break="no"/>ous shapes and scales at the different periods even up to
<lb/>our own days, showing how greatly the balance is in
<lb/>favor of us Modems—but we will not do all this ; we will
<lb/>content ourselves by simply stating that every lady should,
<lb/>for many reasons, be a little familiar with this truly draw-
<lb break="no"/>ing-room instrument. In the first place it is a capital ex-
<lb break="no"/>ercise, bringing the muscles into gentle and healthful play;
<lb/>in the next place it is an excellent accompaniment to the
<lb/>voice; and lastly it displays the beautiful and graceful
<lb/>proportions of nature’s handicraft, to the greatest advan-
<lb break="no"/>tage. Well might a learned Theban eloquently observe,
<lb/>to some young beaux, on beholding a young and graceful
<lb/>woman seated in the most fascinating position, like the
<lb/>Divine Cecilia at her Harp—well might this learned The-
<lb break="no"/>ban observe, we say, “ if you have hearts prepare to lose
<lb/>them now.”</p><p></p><p>Mr. Browne’s Harps are by far the most magnificent in-
<lb break="no"/>struments that we ever saw. Through his perfect knowl-
<lb break="no"/>edge of the instrument he has effected many important
<lb/>improvements in the mechanical department, and in the
<lb/>tone there is an extraordinary addition of sweetness, purity
<lb/>and power. The pillars are elaborately and gorgeously
<lb/>carved and gilded, while the frames are elegantly shaped
<lb/>and finished.</p><p></p><p>There is at present in his show room 281 Broadway (up
<lb/>stairs) a splendid Grand Concert Harp, six and a half oc- 
<lb/>taves in compass, recently sold to a lady of North Caroli- 
<lb/>na, which is without exception the most elegant, chaste
<lb/>and powerful instrument we have ever heard in this coun-
<lb break="no"/>try. It combines all the latest improvements, and we
<lb/>should advise our fair friends, if only as a matter of curi-
<lb break="no"/>osity, to visit Mr. Browne’s establishment, before the in-
<lb break="no"/>strument leaves it for its final destination. We can cor-
<lb break="no"/>dially recommend Mr. Browne’s instruments, as we are
<lb/>well acquainted with the character of the firm of which
<lb/>he is the resident representative.</p><p></p><p>We have received two Elementary Musical Works, for
<lb/>review, the one by J. F. Warner, and the other by E. Ives,
<lb/>Jr.; which we shall notice in our next.</p><p></p><p>Our articles upon the fine Arts are unavoidably crow-
<lb break="no"/>ded out this week ; also a full description of the opening
<lb/>of Mr. Erben’s Organ, at Dr. Potts’ new Church. These
<lb/>shall duly appear in our next.</p><p></p><p>We take the following truly characteristic and espe-
<lb break="no"/>cially French paragraph from the excellent “ Courier

PUBLISH THIS DAY,
Elements of Morality and Polity.
BY PROF. HEWELL.
</p><p>THIS valuable new production, from the pen of
<lb/>one of the most eminent scholars of t e age,
<lb/>exhibits, in a most lucid, exact, and elegant style,
<lb/>the great principles of moral, political, and ecclesi-
<lb break="no"/>astical science in a far more complete and methodi-
<lb break="no"/>cal manner than has ever yet been presented to the
<lb/>public. In offering this great work to the American
<lb/>reader, the publisher begs leave to introduce it as
<lb/>the commencement of a new and attractive series
<lb/> of sterling books, to he issued by them, under the
<lb/>general designation of</p><p>HARPER’S NEW MISCELLANY;
the volumes of which will be legibly printed, in
duodecimo, on fine paper, and
Bound in extra Muslin Gilt—Price
Fifty Cents a Volume,
</p><p>and issued at short intervals To render accessible
<lb/>to the million, the fullest advantages of popular in-
<lb break="no"/>struction in the various divisions of human know-
<lb break="no"/>ledge, is the design of the above series It is appa-
<lb break="no"/>rent in the present day, that books of intrinsic value
<lb/>are demanded by the people. Formerly the popu
<lb/>lar taste preferred mainly works of mere amusement
<lb/>—the great body of readers now seek them as vehi-
<lb break="no"/>cles of general knowledge books of a more per-
<lb break="no"/>manently valuable caste—devoted to some of the
<lb/>departments of science, or general literature. A
<lb/>new race has sprung up, glowing with the first
<lb/>energies of youth, requiring more expanded ideas
<lb/>of the world in which they live, and a more reliable
<lb/>and well-digested knowledge of the men. and the
<lb/>events of other times and countries. A class of
<lb/>books expressly adapted to this demand, it is the
<lb/>aim of the publishers to supply; and at a price so
<lb/>exceedingly cheap that every perron of ordinary
<lb/>taste and advantages may thus become possessed
<lb/>of a</p><p>Complete Library of the Best Litera-
ture of the Age.
In this collection it is intended to include the best
productions in every department of knowledge;
popular philosophical treatise on topics of universal
interest; the most compact and brilliant histori-
cal books; valuable biographical memories; modern
voyages and travels, &amp;c. ; together with scientific
and other collateral divisions; in the selection of 
all which, the most careful discrimination will be
observed. A mere glance over the wide domain of
our English literature will exhibit much yet unex-
plored and uncultivated, from which might be ga-
thered the fruits of a rich, luxuriant harvest; besides
which, the ever-teeming issues of the European
press open a vast revenue of literary wealth, from
which the above collection may be literally suppli-
ed. Original productions from American writers
will also occasionally be introduced. In submitting,
therefore, the esteemed work of Prof. WHEWLL
as a kind of first-fruits of their "New Miscellany,"
the publishers deem it only necessary to add, that
their arrangements for carrying forward the enter-
prise being of the most complete and efficient kind,
they confidently rely upon their efforts being met
with a ready response from the entire reading com-
munity.
</p><p>This, they venture to believe, will be insured to
<lb/>their Miscellany, no less from the intrinsic value
<lb/>of the collection, than from its unparalleled econo
<lb/>my : each volume being elegantly produced, bound</p><p></p><p>IN HANDSOME AND SUBSTANTIAL STYLE FITTED WITH-
<lb break="no"/>OUT FARTHER EXPENSE FOR PERMANENT PRESERVA-
<lb break="no"/>TION in the library ; the whole series being issued
<lb/>in uniform binding, while the price of each volume
<lb/>will be only Fifty Cents—far below the cost of
<lb/>any similar series of books yet published in this,
<lb/>or, it is believed, any other country.</p><p></p><p>PIANO-FORTES CHEAP FOR CASH.—THE

manufacturer of the
IMPROVED PATENT DOUBLE-ACTION HARP
</p><p>By Royal Letters Patent, London. Established 1810. (Many years with Erard.
<lb/>J. F. BROWNE respectfully informs his Friends and the Musical World, that he has established himself for the manufacture
<lb/>and importation of these very beautiful instruments, at	</p><p>281 BROADWAY, and 73 1-2 CHAMBERS STREET.
His arrangements are such as to enable him to transact business at European prices, thereby saving purchasers the high duties imposed by Tariff on these Instruments.
J. F. Browne would observe, these Harps are constructed on the most approved principles, with all the modern improvements of
London and Paris, are unequalled in brilliancy of tone, fineness of touch, and perfectness of mechanism. Particular care is taken
to fit them for the extremes of climate in this country, in which respect they will be found far superior to any of European manufac-ture, imported in the usual way.
These Harps are patronized by the elite of musical taste and professional talent in Europe ; among the latter, he would mention
N. C. Boscha, who invariably selects from this establishment.	
J. F. Browne begs to offer the opinions of some of the first professional talent in this country.
Mr. J. F. Browne, Sir:—Having had for several years past, the opportunity of making a professional use of your Harps, and of
testing their qualities, it affords me pleasure to certify, that in point of tone, workmanship, and above all, a solidity that stands proof
against the inconstancy of our trying climate, they have in all cases given me the most entire satisfaction.
January, 1845.	I am yours, CHARLES THIBAULT, No. 40 Beach St., N. Y.
Dear Sir:—I write to express the delight I experienced in performing on one of your Harps at Sig. Casella's Concert in this city.—	
The mechanism is perfect, and the quality of Tone certainly superior to any harp I have heard for many years. I remember my old
Master, Boscha, always gave the preference to your Harps, indeed he himself used no other. Yours, most truly, H.G. Trust.
Mr. J. F. Browne, Sir :—I have much pleasure in saying, that the Harp of your make I performed on at the St. George's Society
Concert, is, in brilliancy of tone, touch, and elegance of workmanship, the finest I ever played on. This will apply to all your Harps.
The grand six and a half Gothic Double action, is a most splendid instrument. Yours with respect,
New York, January 16th, 1845.		ELIZABETH SLOMAN.
______	A pupil of N. C. Boscha.
Mr. J. F. Browne, Sir:— Having at your request closely scrutinized your double-action Harps, I find they possess the best quali-
ties of the first makers in Europe combined. That in the ease of touch, by which the most brilliant tone is obtained, in perfection and
ease of modulation, they are superior to any I have used; their elegance of exterior must gratify the most refined taste. Your new
Grand Gothic six and a half octave, is the most splendid effort of art yet produced in the musical world; it will give me great pleasure
in recommending your Harps at every opportunity.	Yours Truly, HENRY HORN
January 12th, 1845.	An eminent professor, and Member of the Royal Academy.
These are but a very small part of the testimonials received, but will suffice to show the estimate of persons every way capable of
making a correct decision. J. F. Browne has also received the Franklin Medal of the Society of Arts, Philadelphia, for his splendid
improvements in this delightful Instrument.
