Beauty in Shadow.
I mark a sadness on thy brow,
Not meet in one so fair as thou;
And as I hear thy accent now,
There’s sorrow in each tone;—
O! sure thou hast not felt the chain,
The venom of love’s shaft—the pain,
That from a dream, forever vain,
Leaves life’s sad waking lone!
Like some sweet waters poured to waste,
With few to see, with none to taste,
</p><p>Do thy heart’s precious fountains haste
<lb/>To desert sands and seas?
<lb/>Oh! flowers thy hope in friendless sky,</p><p>Beneath no fond, imploring eye—
Or, like some harp, that hangs on high,
Among forgotten trees?

Q.ui n’a plus qu’un moment a vivre
N’a plus rien a dissimuler__Quinault—Alys.
</p><p>Of my country and of my family I have little to say.
<lb/>Ill usage and length of years have driven me from the
<lb/>one, and estranged me from the other. Hereditary wealth
<lb/>afforded me an education of no common order, and a con-
<lb break="no"/>templative turn of mind enabled me to methodize the
<lb/>stores which early study very diligently garnered up.—
<lb/>Beyond all things, the works of the German moralists
<lb/>gave me great delight; not from any ill-advised admira-
<lb break="no"/>tion of their eloquent madness, but from the ease with
<lb/>which my habits of rigid thought enabled me to detect
<lb/>their falsities. I have often been reproached with the
<lb/>aridity of my genius; a deficiency of imagination has
<lb/>been imputed to me as a crime; and the Pyrrhonism of
<lb/>my opinions has at all times rendered me notorious. In-
<lb break="no"/>deed, a strong relish for physical philosophy has, I fear,
<lb/>tinctured my mind with a very common error of this
<lb/>age—I mean the habit of referring occurrences, even the
<lb/>east susceptible of such reference, to the principles of
<lb/>that science. Upon the whole, no person could be less
<lb/>liable than myself to be led away from the severe pre-
<lb break="no"/>eincts of truth by the ignes fatui of superstition. I have
<lb/>bought proper to premise thus much, lest the incredible
<lb/>tale I have to tell should be considered rather the raving
<lb/>of a crude imagination, than the positive experience of
<lb/>a mind to which the reveries of fancy have been a dead
<lb/>tetter and a nullity.</p><p></p><p>After many years spent in foreign travel, I sailed in
<lb/>the year 18—, from the port of Batavia, in the rich and
<lb/>Populous island of Java, on a voyage to the Archipelago 
<lb/>of the Sunda islands. I went as passenger—having no
<lb/>other inducement than a kind of nervous restlessness
<lb/>which haunted me as a fiend.</p><p></p><p>Our vessel was a beautiful ship of about four hundred
<lb/>tons, copper-fastened, and built at Bombay of Malabar
<lb/>teak. She was freighted with cotton-wool and oil, from
<lb/>the Lachadive islands. We had also on board coir, jag-
<lb break="no"/>geree, ghee, cocoa-nuts, and a few cases of opium. The
<lb/>stowage was clumsily done, and the vessel consequently
<lb/>crank.</p><p></p><p>We got under way with a mere breath of wind, and
<lb/>for many days stood along the eastern coast of Java,
<lb/>without any other incident to beguile the monotony of
<lb/>our course than the occasional meeting with some of the
<lb/>small grabs of the Archipelago to which we were bound.</p><p></p><p>One evening, leaning over the taffrail, I observed a
<lb/>very singular, isolated cloud, to the N. W. It was re-
<lb break="no"/>markable, as well for its color, as from its being the first
<lb/>we had seen since our departure from Batavia. I watch-
<lb break="no"/>ed it attentively until sunset, when it spread all at once
<lb/>to the eastward and westward, girting in the horizon
<lb/>with a narrow strip of vapor, and looking like a long
<lb/>line of low beach. My notice was soon afterwards at-
<lb break="no"/>tracted by the dusky-red appearance of the moon, and
<lb/>the peculiar character of the sea. The latter was under-
<lb break="no"/>going a rapid change, and the water seemed more than
<lb/>usually transparent. Although I could distinctly see the
<lb/>bottom, yet, heaving the lead, I found the ship in fifteen
<lb/>fathoms. The air now became intolerably hot, and was
<lb/>loaded with spiral exhalations similar to those arising
<lb/>from heated iron. As night came on, every breath of
<lb/>wind died away, and a more entire calm it is impossible
<lb/>to conceive. The flame of a candle burned upon' the
<lb/>poop without the least perceptible motion, and a long
<lb/>hair, held between the finger and thumb, hung without
<lb/>the possibility of detecting a vibration. However, as the
<lb/>captain said he could perceive no indication of danger,
<lb/>and as we were drifting in bodily to shore, he ordered
<lb/>the sails to be furled, and the anchor let go. No watch
<lb/>was set, and the crew, consisting principally of Malays,
<lb/>stretched themselves deliberately upon deck. I went be-
<lb break="no"/>low—not without a full presentiment of evil. Indeed,
<lb/>every appearance warranted me in apprehending a Si-
<lb break="no"/>moom. I told the captain my fears; but he paid no at-
<lb break="no"/>tention to what I said, and left me without deigning to
<lb/>give a reply. My uneasiness, however, prevented me
<lb/>from sleeping, and about midnight I went upon deck.—
<lb/>As I placed my foot upon the upper step of the compan-
<lb break="no"/>ion-ladder, I was startled by a loud, humming noise,
<lb/>like that occasioned by the rapid revolution of a mill-
<lb break="no"/>wheel, and before I could ascertain its meaning, I found
<lb/>the ship quivering to its centre. In the next instant, a
<lb/>wilderness of foam hurled us upon our beam-ends, and,
<lb/>rushing over us fore and aft, swept the entire decks from
<lb/>stem to stern.</p><p></p><p>The extreme fury of the blast proved, in a great meas-
<lb break="no"/>ure, the salvation of the ship. Although completely wa-
<lb break="no"/>ter-logged, yet, as her masts had gone by the board, she
<lb/>rose, after a minute, heavily from the sea, and, stagger-</p><p><pb n="204" break="no" />
ing awhile beneath the immense pressure of the tempest,
finally righted.
</p><p>By what miracle I escaped destruction, it is impossible
<lb/>to say. Stunned by the shock of the water, I found my-
<lb break="no"/>self, upon recovery, jammed in between the stern-post
<lb/>and rudder. With great difficulty I gained my feet, and
<lb/>looking dizzily around, was, at first, struck with the idea
<lb/>of our being among breakers ; so terrific, beyond the wild-
<lb break="no"/>est imagination, was the whirlpool of mountainous and
<lb/>foaming ocean within which we were engulfed. After a
<lb/>while, I heard the voice of an old Swede, who had ship-
<lb break="no"/>ped with us at the moment of our leaving port. I hal-
<lb break="no"/>looed to him with all my strength, and presently he came
<lb/>reeling aft. We soon discovered that we were the sole
<lb/>survivors of the accident. All on deck, with the excep-
<lb break="no"/>tion of ourselves, had been swept overboard;—the cap-
<lb break="no"/>tain and mates must have perished as they slept, for the
<lb/>cabins were deluged with water. Without assistance,
<lb/>we could expect to do little for the security of the ship,
<lb/>and our exertions were at first paralyzed by the momen-
<lb break="no"/>tary expectation of going down. Our cable had, of course,
<lb/>parted like pack-thread, at the first breath of the hurri-
<lb break="no"/>cane, or we should have been instantaneously overwhelm-
<lb break="no"/>ed. We scudded with frightful velocity before the sea,
<lb/>and the water made clear breaches over us. The frame-
<lb break="no"/>work of our stern was shattered excessively, and, in al-
<lb break="no"/>most every respect, we had received considerable injury;
<lb/>but to our extreme joy we found the pumps unchoked,
<lb/>and that we had made no great shifting of our ballast.—
<lb/>The main fury of the blast had already blown over, and
<lb/>we apprehended little danger from the violence of the
<lb/>wind; but we looked forward to its total cessation with
<lb/>dismay; well believing, that, in our shattered condition,
<lb/>we should inevitably perish in the tremendous swell
<lb/>which would ensue. But this very just apprehension
<lb/>seemed by no means likely to be soon verified. For five
<lb/>entire days and nights—during which our only subsist-
<lb break="no"/>ence was a small quantity of jaggeree, procured with
<lb/>great difficulty from the forecastle—the hulk flew at a
<lb/>rate defying computation, before rapidly succeeding flaws
<lb/>of wind, which, without equalling the first violence of
<lb/>the Simoom, were still more terrific than any tempest I
<lb/>had before encountered. Our course for the first four
<lb/>days was, with trifling variations, S. E. and by S.; and
<lb/>we must have run down the coast of New Holland.—
<lb/>On the fifth day the cold became extreme, although the
<lb/>wind had hauled round a point more to the northward.—
<lb/>The sun arose with a sickly yellow lustre, and clambered
<lb/>a very few degrees above the horizon—emitting no deci-
<lb break="no"/>sive light. There were no clouds apparent, yet the wind
<lb/>was upon the increase, and blew with a fitful and un-
<lb break="no"/>steady fury. About noon, as nearly as we could guess,
<lb/>our attention was again arrested by the appearance of the
<lb/>sun. It gave out no light, properly so called, but a dull
<lb/>and sullen glow without reflection, as if all its rays were
<lb/>polarized. Just before sinking within the turgid sea, its
<lb/>central fires suddenly went out, as if hurriedly extin-
<lb break="no"/>guished by some unaccountable power. It was a dim,
<lb/>silver-like rim, alone, as it rushed down the unfathomable
<lb/>ocean.</p><p></p><p>We waited in vain for the arrival of the sixth day—
<lb/>that day to me has not arrived—to the Swede, never did
<lb/>arrive. Thenceforward we were enshrouded in pitchy
<lb/>darkness, so that we could not have seen an object at
<lb/>twenty paces from the ship. Eternal night continued to
<lb/>envelop us, all unrelieved by the phosphoric sea-brillian-
<lb break="no"/>cy to which we had been accustomed in the tropics. We
<lb/>observed too, that, although the tempest continued to</p><p></p><p>rage with unabated violence, there was no longer to be
<lb/>discovered the usual appearance of surf, or foam, which
<lb/>had hitherto attended us. All around were horror, and
<lb/>thick gloom, and a black sweltering desert of ebony.—
<lb/>Superstitious terror crept by degrees into the spirit of the
<lb/>old Swede, and my own soul was wrapped up in silent
<lb/>wonder. We neglected all care of the ship, as worse
<lb/>than useless, and securing ourselves, as well as possible,
<lb/>to the stump of the mizen-mast, looked out bitterly into
<lb/>the world of ocean. We had no means of calculating
<lb/>time, nor could we form any guess of our situation. We
<lb/>were, however, well aware of having made farther to
<lb/>the southward than any previous navigators, and felt
<lb/>great amazement at not meeting with the usual impedi-
<lb break="no"/>ments of ice. In the meantime every moment threaten-
<lb break="no"/>ed to be our last—every mountainous billow hurried to
<lb/>overwhelm us. The swell surpassed anything I had
<lb/>imagined possible, and that we were not instantly buried
<lb/>is a miracle. My companion spoke of the lightness of
<lb/>our cargo, and reminded me of the excellent qualities of
<lb/>our ship; but I could not help feeling the utter hopeless-
<lb break="no"/>ness of hope itself, and prepared myself gloomily for that
<lb/>death which I thought nothing could defer beyond an
<lb/>hour, as, with every knot of way the ship made, the
<lb/>swelling of the black stupendous seas became more dis-
<lb break="no"/>mally appalling. At times we gasped for breath at an
<lb/>elevation beyond the albatross—at times became dizzy
<lb/>with the velocity of our descent into some watery hell,
<lb/>where the air grew stagnant, and no sound disturbed the
<lb/>slumbers of the kraken.</p><p></p><p>We were at the bottom of one of these abysses, when
<lb/>a quick scream from my companion broke fearfully upon
<lb/>the night. “See!” see!” cried he, shrieking in my
<lb/>ears, “Almighty God! see! see!” As he spoke, I be-
<lb break="no"/>came aware of a dull, sullen glare of red light which
<lb/>streamed down the sides of the vast chasm where we
<lb/>lay, and threw a fitful brilliancy upon our deck. Casting
<lb/>my eyes upwards, I beheld a spectacle which froze the
<lb/>current of my blood. At a terrific height directly above
<lb/>us, and upon the very verge of the precipitous descent,
<lb/>hovered a gigantic ship of, perhaps, four thousand tons.
<lb/>Although upreared upon the summit of a wave more
<lb/>than a hundred times her own altitude, her apparent
<lb/>size still exceeded that of any ship of the line or East
<lb/>Indiaman in existence. Her huge hull was of a deep
<lb/>dingy black, unrelieved by any of the customary carvings
<lb/>of a ship. A single row of brass cannon protruded from
<lb/>her open ports, and dashed from their polished surfaces
<lb/>the fires of innumerable battle-lanterus, which swung to
<lb/>and fro about her rigging. But what mainly inspired us
<lb/>with horror and astonishment, was that she bore up un-
<lb break="no"/>der a press of sail in the very teeth of that supernatural
<lb/>sea, and of that ungovernable hurricane. When we first
<lb/>discovered her, her bows were alone to be seen, as she
<lb/>rose slowly from the dim and horrible gulf beyond her.
<lb/>For a moment of intense terror she paused upon the gid-
<lb break="no"/>dy pinnacle, as if in contemplation of her own sublimity,
<lb/>then trembled and tottered, and—came down.</p><p></p><p>At this instant, I know not what sudden self-possession
<lb/>came over my spirit. Staggering as far aft as I could, I
<lb/>awaited fearlessly the ruin that was to overwhelm. Our
<lb/>own vessel was at length ceasing from her struggles,
<lb/>and sinking with her head to the sea. The shock of the
<lb/>descending mass struck her, consequently, in that portion
<lb/>of her frame which was already under water, and the in-
<lb break="no"/>evitable result was to hurl me, with irresistible violence,
<lb/>upon the rigging of the stranger.</p><p>
<pb n="205"/>
</p><p>As I fell, the ship hove in stays, and went about; and to
<lb/>the confusion ensuing I attributed my escape from the
<lb/>notice of the crew. With little difficulty I made my
<lb/>way unperceived to the main hatchway, which was par-
<lb break="no"/>tially open, and soon found an opportunity of secreting
<lb/>myself in the hold. Why I did so I can hardly tell. An
<lb/>indefinite sense of awe, which at first sight of the navi,
<lb/>gators of the ship had taken hold of my mind, was per-
<lb break="no"/>haps the principle of my concealment. I was unwilling
<lb/>to trust myself with a race of people who had offered, to
<lb/>the cursory glance I had taken, so many points of vague
<lb/>novelty, doubt, and apprehension. I therefore thought
<lb/>proper to contrive a hiding-place in the hold. This I did
<lb/>by removing a small portion of the shifting-boards, in
<lb/>such a manner as to afford me a convenient retreat be-
<lb break="no"/>tween the huge timbers of the ship.</p><p></p><p>I had scarcely completed my work, when a footstep in
<lb/>the hold forced me to make use of it. A man passed by
<lb/>my place of concealment with a feeble and unsteady
<lb/>gait. I could not see his face, but had an opportunity of
<lb/>observing his general appearance. There was about it
<lb/>an evidence of great age and infirmity. His knees tot-
<lb break="no"/>tered beneath a load of years, and his entire frame quiv-
<lb break="no"/>ered under the burthen. He muttered to himself, in a
<lb/>low broken tone, some words of a language which I could
<lb/>not understand, and groped in a corner among a pile of
<lb/>singular-looking instruments, and decayed charts of na-
<lb break="no"/>vigation. His manner was a wild mixture of the pee-
<lb break="no"/>vishness of second childhood, and the solemn dignity of
<lb/>a God. He at length went on deck, and I saw him no
<lb/>more.</p><p>*	*	*	*	*	*	*
</p><p>A feeling, for which I have no name, has taken pos-
<lb break="no"/>session of my soul—a sensation which will admit of no
<lb/>analysis, to which the lessons of by-gone time are inade-
<lb break="no"/>quate, and for which I fear futurity itself will offer me
<lb/>no key. To a mind constituted like my own, the latter
<lb/>consideration is an evil. I shall never—I know that I
<lb/>shall never—be satisfied with regard to the nature of my
<lb/>conceptions. Yet it is not wonderful that these concep-
<lb break="no"/>tions are indefinite, since they have their origin in sour-
<lb break="no"/>ces so utterly novel. A new sense—a new entity is added</p><p>to my soul. *	*	*	*	*
</p><p>It is long since I first trod the deck of this terrible
<lb/>ship, and the rays of my destiny are, I think, gathering
<lb/>to a focus. Incomprehensible men! Wrapped up in me-
<lb break="no"/>ditations of a kind which I cannot divine, they pas! me
<lb/>by unnoticed. Concealment is utter folly on my part, for
<lb/>the people trill not see. It was but just now that I
<lb/>passed directly before the eyes of the mate—it was no
<lb/>long while ago that I ventured into the captain’s own
<lb/>private cabin, and took thence the materials with which
<lb/>I write, and have written. I shall from time to time
<lb/>continue this journal. It is true that I may not find an
<lb/>opportunity of transmitting it to the world, but I will
<lb/>not fail to make the endeavour. At the last moment I
<lb/>will enclose the MS. in a bottle, and cast it within the
<lb/>sea.*	*	*	*	*	* </p><p>
</p><p>An incident has occurred which has given me new
<lb/>room for meditation. Are such things the operation of
<lb/>ungoverned Chance? I had ventured upon deck and
<lb/>thrown myself down, without attracting any notice,
<lb/>among a pile of ratlin-stuff and old sails, in the bottom
<lb/>of the yawl. While musing upon the singularity of my
<lb/>fate, I unwittingly daubed with a tar-brush the edges of
<lb/>a neatly-folded studding-sail which lay near me on a
<lb/>barrel The studding-sail is now bent upon the ship,</p><p>and the thoughtless touches of the brush are spread out
into the word DISCOVERY. *	*	*
</p><p>I have made many observations lately upon the struc-
<lb break="no"/>ture of the vessel. Although well armed, she is not, I
<lb/>think, a ship of war. Her rigging, build, and general
<lb/>equipment, all negative a supposition of this kind. What
<lb/>she is not, I can easily perceive—what she is I fear it is
<lb/>impossible to say. I know not how it is, but in scrutini-
<lb break="no"/>zing her strange model and singular cast of spars, her
<lb/>huge size and overgrown suits of canvass, her severely
<lb/>simple bow and antiquated stern, there will occasionally
<lb/>flash across my mind a sensation of familiar things, and
<lb/>there is always mixed up with such indistinct shadows
<lb/>of recollection, an unaccountable memory of old foreign
<lb/>chronicles and ages long ago. *	*	*</p><p></p><p>I have been looking at the timbers of the ship. She
<lb/>is built of a material to which I am a stranger. There
<lb/>is a peculiar character about the wood which strikes me
<lb/>as rendering it unfit for the purpose to which it has been
<lb/>applied. I mean its extreme porousnses, considered in-
<lb break="no"/>dependently of the worm-eaten condition which is a con-
<lb break="no"/>sequence of navigation in these seas, and apart from the
<lb/>rottenness attendant upon age. It will appear perhaps
<lb/>an observation somewhat over-curious, but this wood
<lb/>would have every characteristic of Spanish oak, if Span-
<lb break="no"/>ish oak were distended by any unnatural means.</p><p></p><p>In reading the above sentence a curious apothegm of
<lb/>an old weather-beaten Dutch navigator comes full upon
<lb/>my recollection. “It is as sure,” he was wont to say,
<lb/>when any doubt was entertained of his veracity, “as
<lb/>sure as there is a sea where the ship itself will grow in
<lb/>bulk like the living body of the seaman.” *	*</p><p></p><p>About an hour ago, I made bold to thrust myself among
<lb/>a group of the crew. They paid me no manner of atten-
<lb break="no"/>tion, and, although I stood in the very midst of them all,
<lb/>seemed utterly unconscious of my presence. Like the
<lb/>one I had at first seen in the hold, they all bore about
<lb/>them the marks of a hoary old age. Their knees trem-
<lb break="no"/>bled with infirmity; their shoulders were bent double
<lb/>with decrepitude; their shrivelled skins rattled in the
<lb/>wind; their voices were low, tremulous and broken;
<lb/>their eyes glistened with the rheum of years; and their
<lb/>gray hairs streamed terribly in the tempest. Around
<lb/>them, on every part of the deck, lay scattered mathema-
<lb break="no"/>tical instruments of the most quaint and obsolete con-
<lb break="no"/> struction.	*****</p><p></p><p>I mentioned some time ago the bending of a studding-
<lb break="no"/>sail. From that period the ship, being thrown dead off
<lb/>the wind, has continued her terrific course due south,
<lb/>with every rag of canvass packed upon her, from her
<lb/>trucks to her lower studding-sail booms, and rolling every
<lb/>moment her top-gallant yard-arms into the most appall-
<lb break="no"/>ing hell of water which it can enter into the mind of man
<lb/>to imagine. I have just left the deck, where I find it
<lb/>impossible to maintain a footing, although the crew
<lb/>seem to experience little inconvenience. It appears to
<lb/>me a miracle of miracles that our enormous bulk is not
<lb/>swallowed up at once and forever. We are surely doomed
<lb/>to hover continually upon the brink of Eternity, without
<lb/>taking a final plunge into the abyss. From billows a thou-
<lb break="no"/>sand times more stupendous than any I have ever seen,
<lb/>we glide away with the facility of the arrowy sea-gull;
<lb/>and the colossal waters rear their heads above us like
<lb/>demons of the deep, but like demons confined to simple
<lb/>threats and forbidden to destroy. I am led to attribute
<lb/>these frequent escapes to the only natural cause which
<lb/>can account for such effect.—I must suppose the ship to</p><p><pb n="206"/>
be within the influence of some strong current, or impe-
tuous under-tow.	*	*	*	*
</p><p>I have seen the captain face to face, and in his own
<lb/>cabin—hut, as I expected, he paid me no attention. Al-
<lb break="no"/>though in his appearance there is, to a casual observer,
<lb/>nothing which might bespeak him more or less than man
<lb/>—still a feeling of irrepressible reverence and awe min-
<lb break="no"/>gled with the sensation of wonder with which I regard-
<lb break="no"/>ed him. In stature he is nearly my own height; that is,
<lb/>about five feet eight inches. He is of a well-knit and
<lb/>compact frame of body, neither robust nor remarkably
<lb/>otherwise. But it is the singularity of the expres-
<lb break="no"/>sion which reigns upon the face—it is the intense, the
<lb/>wonderful, the thrilling evidence of old age so utter, so
<lb/>extreme, which excites within my spirit a sense—a sen-
<lb break="no"/>timent ineffable. His forehead, although little wrinkled,
<lb/>seems to bear upon it the stamp of a myriad of years.—
<lb/>His gray hairs are records of the past, and his grayer
<lb/>eyes are Sybils of the future. The cabin floor was thick-
<lb break="no"/>ly strewn with strange, iron-clasped folios, and moulder-
<lb break="no"/>ing instruments of science, and obsolete long-forgotten
<lb/>charts. His head was bowed down upon his hands, and
<lb/>he pored, with a fiery unquiet eye, over a paper which I
<lb/>took to be a commission, and which, at all events, bore
<lb/>the signature of a monarch. He muttered to himself, as
<lb/>did the first seaman whom I saw in the hold, some low
<lb/>peevish syllables of a foreign tongue, and although the
<lb/>speaker was close at my elbow, his voice seemed to reach
<lb/>my ears from the distance of a mile. * 	*</p><p></p><p>The ship and all in it are imbued with the spirit of
<lb/>Eld. The crew glide to and fro like the ghosts of buried
<lb/>centuries; their eyes have an eager and uneasy meaning;
<lb/>and when their figures fall athwart my path in the wild
<lb/>glare of the battle-lanterns, I feel as I have never felt be-
<lb break="no"/>fore, although I have baen all my life a dealer in antiqui-
<lb break="no"/>ties, and have imbibed the shadows of fallen columns at
<lb/>Balbec, and Tadmor, and Persepolis, until my very soul
<lb/>has become a ruin.	*	*	*	*</p><p></p><p>When I look around me I feel ashamed of my former
<lb/>apprehensions. If I trembled at the blast which has
<lb/>hitherto attended us, shall I not stand aghast at a war-
<lb break="no"/>ring of wind and ocean, to convey any idea of which the
<lb/>words tornado and simoom are trivial and ineffective!
<lb/>All in the immediate vicinity of the ship is the black-
<lb break="no"/>ness of eternal night, and a chaos of foamless water;
<lb/>but, about a league on either side of us, may be seen, in-
<lb break="no"/>distinctly and at intervals, stupendous ramparts of ice,
<lb/>towering away into the desolate sky, and looking like
<lb/>the walls of the universe.	*	*	*</p><p></p><p>As I imagined, the ship proves to be in a current; if
<lb/>that appellation can properly be given to a tide which,
<lb/>howling and shrieking by the white ice, thunders on to
<lb/>the southward with a velocity like the headlong dashing
<lb/>of a cataract. *****</p><p></p><p>To conceive the horror of my sensations is, I presume,
<lb/>utterly impossible; yet a curiosity to penetrate the mys-
<lb break="no"/>teries of these awful regions, predominates even over my
<lb/>despair, and will reconcile me to the most hideous aspect
<lb/>of death. It is evident that we are hurrying onwards to
<lb/>some exciting knowledge—some never-to-be-imparted se-
<lb break="no"/>cret, whose attainment is destruction. Perhaps this cur-
<lb break="no"/>rent leads us to the southern pole itself. It must be con-
<lb break="no"/>fessed that a supposition apparently so wild has every
<lb/>probability in its favor. *	*	*	*</p><p>The crew pace the deck with unquiet and tremulous
step; but there is upon their countenances an expression
more of the eagerness of hope than of the apathy of de-
spair.
In the meantime the wind is still in our poop, and, as
we carry a crowd of canvass, the ship is at times lifted
bodily from out the sea——Oh, horror upon horror!
</p><p>the ice opens suddenly to the right, and to the left, and
<lb/>we are whirling dizzily, in immense concentric circles,
<lb/>round and round the borders of a gigantic amphitheatre,
<lb/>the summit of whose walls is lost in the darkness and
<lb/>the distance. But little time will be left me to ponder
<lb/>upon my destiny—the circles rapidly grow small—we
<lb/>are plunging madly within the grasp of the whirlpool—
<lb/>and amid a roaring, and bellowing, and thundering of
<lb/>ocean and of tempest, the ship is quivering, oh God!
<lb/>and—going down.	Edgar a. Poe.</p><p>Stanzas.
Oh! lay not her loveliness under the sod,
When life’s silver chord shall have parted;
The frame of the late when the music’s with God—
The gentle girl now broken-hearted!
Would ye that the worms of the valley should prey
On the lips once like roses above her?
Or rather the Fire King waft her away,
Forever, in free air, to hover I
Then of amber and wood of the sandal-tree rear
All fragrant the funeral pyre:
For sure there is nothing of darksome or drear
In the shadowless Spirit of Fire!
Oh! beautiful he is, and hath not his peers
In the elements—he is their master!
To him give her blighted bloom dew’d with our tears,
And he, though he burn, will not blast her!
She shall scorch, like the lily she looks, in his breath;
But paly, and pure, and perfuming,
His arms shall her beauty unhlemished enwreath,
And even refine whilst consuming.
Ye will find that, when clouds which conceal her unfold,
She hath fled in her rich robes of burning!
But glean from the smouldering pile and when cold
Give the ashes a splendid inurning!
And oft as the evening star chastens the blush
Of sunset that brightens beneath her,
Ye will deem it her heart, which its soft fires flush,
That palpitates in the pure ether!

The Due De L'Omelette.
And stepped at once into a cooler clime.—Cowper.
</p><p>Keats fell by a criticism. Who was it died of “The
<lb/>Andromache?"*  Ignoble souls!—De L’Omelette perish-
<lb break="no"/>ed of an ortolan. L'histoire en est brère. Assist me, Spi-
<lb break="no"/>rit of Apicius!</p><p></p><p>A golden cage bore the little winged wanderer, ena-
<lb break="no"/>mored, melting, indolent, to the Chaussée D'Antin, from
<lb/>its home in far Peru. From its queenly possessor La Bel-</p><p>• Montfleury. The author of the Parnasse Réformé makes him
thus speak in Hades:—“L'Komme done qui roudrait savoir ce dont

lissima, to the Due De L’Omelette, six peers of the em-
pire conveyed the happy bird.
</p><p>That night the Due was to sup alone. In the privacy
<lb/>of his bureau he reclined languidly on that ottoman, for
<lb/>which he sacrificed his loyalty in outbidding his king,—
<lb/>the notorious ottoman of Cadet.</p><p></p><p>He buries his face in the pillow. The clock strikes!
<lb/>Unable to restrain his feelings, his Grace swallows an
<lb/>olive. At this moment the door gently opens to the
<lb/>sound of soft music, and lo! the most delicate of birds
<lb/>is before the most enamored of men! But what inex-
<lb break="no"/>pressible dismay now overshadows the countenance of</p><p>the Due ?—“Horreur!—chien!—Baptiste —I’oiseau!
</p><p>ah, bon Dieu! cet oiseau modeste que tu as deshabillé de
<lb/>ses plumes, et que tu as servi sans papier!" It is su-
<lb break="no"/>perfluous to say more:—the Due expired in a paroxysm
<lb/>of disgust. *	*	*	*	*</p><p>“Ha! ha! ha!”, said his Grace on the third day af-
ter his decease.
“He! he! he!”, replied the Devil faintly, drawing
himself up with an air of hauteur.
</p><p>“Why, surely you are not serious,” retorted De L’Om-
<lb break="no"/>elette. “I have sinned—c'est vrai—but, my good sir,
<lb/>consider!—you have no actual intention of putting such
<lb/>—such—barbarous threats into execution.”</p><p>“No what ?” said his majesty— "come, sir, strip!”
</p><p>“Strip, indeed!—very pretty i’ faith!—no, sir, I shall
<lb/>not strip. Who are you, pray, that I, Due De L’Ome-
<lb break="no"/>lette, Prince de Foie-Gras, just come of age, author of
<lb/>the ‘Mazurkiad,’ and Member of the Academy, should
<lb/>divest myself at your bidding of the sweetest pantaloons
<lb/>ever made by Bourdon, the daintiest robe-de-chambre ev-
<lb break="no"/>er put together byRombert—to say nothing of the taking
<lb/>my hair out of paper—not to mention the trouble I should
<lb/>have in drawing off my gloves?”</p><p></p><p>“Who am I?—ah, true! I am Baal-Zebub, Prince of
<lb/>the Fly. I took thee, just now, from a rose-wood coffin
<lb/>inlaid with ivory. Thou wast curiously scented, and la-
<lb break="no"/>belled as per invoice. Belial sent thee,—my Inspector
<lb/>of Cemeteries. The pantaloons, which thou sayest were
<lb/>made by Bourdon, are an excellent pair of linen draw-
<lb break="no"/>ers, and thy robe-de-chambre is a shroud of no scanty di-
<lb break="no"/>mensions.”</p><p></p><p>“Sir!” replied the Due, “I am not to be insulted with
<lb/>impunity!—Sir! I shall take the earliest opportunity of
<lb/>avenging this insult!—Sir! you shall hear from me! In
<lb/>the meantime au revoir!”—and the Due was bowing
<lb/>himself out of the Satanic presence, when he was inter-
<lb break="no"/>rupted and brought back by a gentleman in waiting.—</p><p></p><p>Hereupon his Grace rubbed his eyes, yawned, shrugged
<lb/>his shoulders, reflected. Having become satisfied of his
<lb/>identity, he took a bird’s eye view of his whereabouts.</p><p></p><p>The apartment was superb. Even De L’Omelette pro-
<lb break="no"/>nounced it bien comme il faut. It was not its length nor
<lb/>its breadth,—but its height—ah, that was appalling!—
<lb/>There was no ceiling—certainly none—but a dense whirl-
<lb break="no"/>ing inass of fiery-colored clouds. His Grace’s brain reel-
<lb break="no"/>ed as he glanced upwards. From above, hung a chain
<lb/>of an unknown blood-red metal—its upper end lost, like
<lb/>the city of Boston, parmi let nues. From its nether ex-
<lb break="no"/>tremity swung a large cresset. The Due knew it to be a
<lb/>ruby; but from it there poured a light so intense, so still,
<lb/>to terrible, Persia never worshipped such—Gheber never
<lb/>imagined such—Mussulman never dreamed of such when,
<lb/>drugged with opium, he has tottered to a bed of poppies,
<lb/>his back to the flowers, and his face to the God Apollo.
<lb/>The Due muttered a slight oath, decidedly approbatory.</p><p></p><p>The corners of the room were rounded into niches.—
<lb/>Three of these were filled with statues of gigantic pro-
<lb break="no"/>portions. Their beauty was Grecian, their deformity
<lb/>Egyptian, their tout ensemble French. In the fourth
<lb/>niche the statue was veiled; it was not colossal. But
<lb/>then there was a taper ankle, a sandalled foot. De L’Om-
<lb break="no"/>elette pressed his hand upon his heart, closed his eyes,
<lb/>raised them, and caught his Satanic Majesty—in a blush.</p><p>But the paintings!—Kupris! Astarte! Astoreth!—a
thousand and the same! And Rafaelle has beheld them!
Yes, Rafaelle has been here; for did he not paint the——?
</p><p>and was he not consequently damned? The paintings!
<lb/>—the paintings! O luxury! 0 love!—who, gazing on
<lb/>those forbidden beauties, shall have eyes for the dainty
<lb/>devices of the golden frames that besprinkle, like stars,
<lb/>the hyacinth and the porphyry walls?</p><p></p><p>But the Due’s heart is fainting within him. He is not,
<lb/>however, as you suppose, dizzy with magnificence, nor
<lb/>drunk with the ecstatic breath of those innumerable
<lb/>censers. C'est vrai que de toutes ces choses il a pense
<lb/>beaucoup—mais! The Due De L’Omelette is terror-
<lb break="no"/>stricken; for, through the lurid vista which a single un-
<lb break="no"/>curtained window is affording, lo! gleams the most
<lb/>ghastly of all fires!</p><p></p><p>Le pauvre Duc! He could not help imagining that
<lb/>the glorious, the voluptuous, the never-dying melodies
<lb/>which pervaded that hall, as they passed filtered and
<lb/>transmuted through the alchemy of the enchanted win-
<lb break="no"/>dow-panes, were the wailings and the howlings of the
<lb/>hopeless and the damned! And there, too !—there!—
<lb/>upon that ottoman!—who could he be?—he, the petil-
<lb break="no"/>maitre—no, the Deity—who sat as if carved in marble,
<lb/>et qui sourit, with his pale countenance, si amérement?</p><p></p><p>Mats il faut agir,—that is to say, a Frenchman never
<lb/>faints outright. Besides, his Grace hated a scene—De
<lb/>L’Omelette is himself again. There were some foils
<lb/>upon a table—some points also. The Due had studied</p><p>under B——; il avail tue ses six homines. Now, then,
</p><p>il peut s'échapper. He measures two points, and, with
<lb/>a grace inimitable, offers his majesty the choice, Hor-
<lb break="no"/>reur! his Majesty does not fence!</p><p></p><p>Mats tl joue!—how happy a thought!—but his Grace
<lb/>had always an excellent memory. He had dipped in the
<lb/>“ Diable” of the Abbe Gualtier. Therein it is said “que
<lb/>le Diable n’ose pas refuser un jeu d'écarte."</p><p></p><p>But the chances—the chances! True—desperate: but
<lb/>scarcely more desperate than the Due. Besides, was he
<lb/>not in the secret?—had he not skimmed over Père Le
<lb/>Bran?—was he not a member of the Club Vingt-un?—
<lb/>“Si je perds," said he, “je serai deux fois perdu—I
<lb/>shall be doubly damned—votla tout! (Here his Grace
<lb/>shrugged his shoulders) Si je gagne, je reviendrai à
<lb/>mes ortolans—que les cartes soient préparées!”</p><p></p><p>His Grace was all care, all attention—his Majesty all
<lb/>confidence. A spectator would have thought of Francis
<lb/>and Charles. His Grace thought of his game. His Ma-
<lb break="no"/>jesty did not think; he shuffled. The Duc cut.</p><p>The cards are dealt. The trump is turned—it is—it
is—the king! No—it was the queen. His Majesty curs-
ed her masculine habiliments. De L’Omelette placed
his hand upon his heart.
</p><p>They play. The Duc counts. The hand is out. His
<lb/>Majesty counts heavily, smiles, and is taking wine. The
<lb/>Due slips a card.</p><p></p><p>"C'est à rous à faire," said his Majesty, cutting. His
<lb/>Grace bowed, dealt, and arose from the table en presen-
<lb break="no"/>tant le Roi.</p><p>2o<pb n="8"/>
His Majesty looked chagrined.
</p><p>Had Alexander not been Alexander, he would have
<lb/>been Diogenes; and the Duc assured his antagonist in ta-
<lb break="no"/>king leave, “que s'il n'eut pas été Be L’Omelette il n'au-
<lb break="no"/>rait point d’objection d’etre le Diable."</p><p>Littleton Barry.
To Constance.
Forgive me, Lady, if I bring to bear
Upon my case, a fable of old times;
Since Poesie did ne’er such beauty wear
As in the breathing of those antique rhymes.
Love was Ideal then, and Fancy dress’d,
Some mortal form in attributes divine;
She was the Deity all men confessed,
And bowed down soul and reason at her shrine.
Where shall we find such passion now? ah! where?
Are not those vain, though sweet, delusive lays?
Love and Romance grow strangers year by year,
’Till rare their meeting in these actual days.
But sometimes there is found amidst the throng
A being aged in care, with heart still young,
Who still finds truth in the wild dreamer’s song,
Like ivy, clinging, where in youth he clung.
These are but few, yet rarer still we find
The God-like cause, that makes such thoughts to be;
I might have liqed and perished cold and blind
To all such bliss, had it not been for thee.
FABLE.
“Thou art, like me, but common earth—then why
Shouldst thou so rich in rarest odors be?”
This was the modest and the wise reply:—
“I nursed the Rose—its sweetness lives with me!”
So I, who am but common clay, have caught
From thy bright Presence some of its pure light;
As great a change is in my being wrought,
As brings the sun to the down-winged night.
I am of thee poor counterfeit, alas!
Grafting thy virtues on a worthless tree;
Yet from my heart their glory shall not pass,
But hallow, like the Rose, their sanctuary.	w.
The Falling Star.
</p><p>It was deep midnight, and no moon shone, but the thou-
<lb break="no"/>sand stars of heaven looked down upon the sleeping
<lb/>earth, and kept their watch for her. A fair girl knelt by 
<lb/>the bed of the dying minstrel—she was his sister. She
<lb/>had tended him for many days with an untiring love—she
<lb/>would not that an alien eye should catch his latest look,
<lb/>or menial hand minister to his latest earthly want. For
<lb/>many hours she had not left his side, but kneeling there,
<lb/>with one hand clasped in her upraised hands, she gazed
<lb/>alternately from him to the vast heaven, searching its
<lb/>inmost depths with an untiring ken, as if she would tear
<lb/>from out its mystic heart the secret of a fate so interwoven
<lb/>with hers. But no sign came, and she turned and wept.
<lb/>Oh! the deep agony of that young heart! It was an un-
<lb break="no"/>alloyed sorrow, which admitted of no earthly consola-
<lb break="no"/>tion. They were alone—these two young hearts—and
<lb/>other tie had none. All they had loved were in the
<lb/>grave, and they awoke one day as from a trance, and
<lb/>looked around and cried out for a friend, but they found
<lb/>none, and from that day they were one heart. They were
<lb/>both beautiful, and genius had been their heritage, and
<lb/>grew alike in both, only that hers was much less bold
<lb/>than His, for that it had received its tone from her sweet</p><p></p><p>gentleness, mixed with deep reverence for his more rea-
<lb break="no"/>soning mind—as the gazer on water sees some bright star
<lb/>reflected on its bosom, and sees they are alike, save that
<lb/>the image is more shadowy, which is but caused by the
<lb/>properties of that in which it shows. So wrapt were
<lb/>they in each other, that the outer world had no charm for
<lb/>them, saving its humanities; the follies of fashion and
<lb/>the frivolities of life were unknown to them. They had
<lb/>drawn around them a magic circle, in which nought save
<lb/>what was bright and beautiful dare enter. Day after day
<lb/>did they gather wisdom from the pages of the mighty
<lb/>dead, and as the old world opened to their ardent minds,
<lb/>the present faded as a dream. They loved to dwell upon
<lb/>some tale of rare affection, of deep devotion, or self-im-
<lb break="no"/>molation at the shrine of duty—instances of which the
<lb/>Past has in perfection, gilded perhaps by the romance a
<lb/>lapse of time never fails to bestow, but still unaffectedly
<lb/>human. And when they rose from their labor of love,
<lb/>they felt the deep effect which lessons of exalted virtue
<lb/>ever impress on reflecting minds. They impart a dig-
<lb break="no"/>nity to life which is unobserved in the every-day world,
<lb/>and link the heart to its kind by the noblest sentiments
<lb/>that nature can evince. They were the Philanthropists
<lb/>of the closet, unbounded in their sympathy, but from their
<lb/>sensibility and refinement, all unfit to mingle with the
<lb/>coarser spirits of the world. What excited their benevo-
<lb break="no"/>lence in a mass would most probably cause disgust in the
<lb/>individual, and they would turn away heart-sick to find
<lb/>the world not what they thought it. They would mourn
<lb/>for the suffering million, but the leprous wretch in the
<lb/>filthy hovel would be a loathed and hideous object in their
<lb/>eyes. Such is the difference between the theoretical and
<lb/>the practical Christian—the one refines and gives out
<lb/>Utopian theories to the world, which never are adopted,
<lb/>benefitting no one, though not the less noble in their aim,
<lb/>—the other seeks out Misery in its home, and bars out
<lb/>hungering Famine from the starving wretch; and though
<lb/>the means of assistance may be small, the never-failing
<lb/>font of Sympathy skins over the wounds it cannot radi-
<lb break="no"/>cally heal. They saw that the world was beautiful, and
<lb/>were content to breathe the odor of its flowers, without
<lb/>distilling the poison from their hearts. They were dream-
<lb break="no"/>ers, and had they been separate, such feelings would
<lb/>have craved the sympathy of some kindred heart, and
<lb/>they might have loved; but they were all in all to each
<lb/>other; their feelings were so knit, so interwoven, that
<lb/>the approach of any other sentiment seemed to threaten a
<lb/>disruption of the tie, and they sensitively and gladly
<lb/>shrank back into the gentle and unreserved commune of
<lb/>their own pure thoughts. They were orphans, and friend-
<lb break="no"/>less,—they were alone, and loving! And now the sister
<lb/>knelt by the side of her dying brother! That was her
<lb/>grief;—for him her tears flowed fast, and the visible si-
<lb break="no"/>lence was broken by deep and fervent prayers. But the
<lb/>fever raged with unabated violence,—he muttered wild
<lb/>words, which conjured up the vision of a thousand hap-
<lb break="no"/>py hours, and caused a fresh burst of grief from the
<lb/>spirit-broken girl. The malady was evidently approach-
<lb break="no"/>ing its crisis; every moment the stillness became more
<lb/>awful. She longed to call for some one to share her
<lb/>watch, yet could not for a moment tear herself from the
<lb/>couch. He had breathed hardly until now, but now she
<lb/>missed the sound—it had sunk to a child’s breathing—
<lb/>and faint and frequent throbbed the pulses at his heart:—
<lb/>the eye which had been glaring and restless became fix-
<lb break="no"/>ed;—she longed to scream, but the voice seemed frozen
<lb/>at her heart, More feebly still he breathed; an expres-</p><p><pb n="209" break="no" />
</p><p>sion of agony was on his brow; his hand relaxed its
<lb/>grasp, and with one deep sigh his features faded into a
<lb/>quiet smile; his spirit seemed to have left its earthly
<lb/>home! Throwing her despairing eyes to heaven, she
<lb/>shrieked, “Oh, God, have mercy!”—And a bright star
<lb/>fell!</p><p>But he recovered, and a week hence was seated on a
couch, with that fair girl nestling at his feet. *	*	*
****	*	*	*	* * I "have been a grievous
</p><p>trouble to thee, Marian! Thine eye is as bright, thy
<lb/>smile as sweet, but thy cheek is pale, and thy hands have
<lb/>shrunk to thinness. And I fear that in my sadness, I may
<lb/>have spoken harsh words to thee, or have been wilful and
<lb/>fretful, or wishful and exacting; but now I crave your
<lb/>pardon, dearest, and throw myself upon your love for your
<lb/>forgiveness." “Hush! hush!” said Marian, as she placed
<lb/>her hand upon his mouth—“dear Ernest, most wrongfully
<lb/>do you accuse yourself;—both gentle and patient were
<lb/>you during all your sufferings; no murmur fell from your
<lb/>lips; no repining—no impatience—and every office I per-
<lb break="no"/>formed for you was more than repaid by the look of love
<lb/>and thankfulness with which it was received.” “But—”
<lb/>“Nay, hear me. If I have lost the ruddiness of health
<lb/>from off my cheek and its fullness from my form, it was
<lb/>not caused by watching and waiting upon your couch,
<lb/>but by the ever present fear that you might be taken from
<lb/>me. It tortured me through the day, and affrighted me
<lb/>in the night. I could not fly from the thought. I read it
<lb/>in the setting sun—in the flickering taper—and as the
<lb/>stars came out, and faded as the night wore on, each
<lb/>seemed to bear upon it a ray of mystic recognition of
<lb/>your embodied spirit.” “I have but faint remembrance
<lb/>of the past. I know the days—though cheered by sight
<lb/>of you—seemed endless.” “’Twas strange, too, Earnest;
<lb/>throughout the day you would appear strangely unset-
<lb break="no"/>tied; a feverish restlessness seemed to pervade your j
<lb/>frame; but as the night came on this was superseded by
<lb/>a calmness, trance-like, nay, almost deathly, that made
<lb/>my blood stagnate in every vein—at those times, with a
<lb/>a philosophy which failed me utterly in the day, I would
<lb/>speculate upon the possibility of your death—and all at
<lb/>once I seemed to cease to be a being of the earth—the
<lb/>mystic line was spoken, and my mind was cognizant of
<lb/>the immaterial elements. Countless bright shapes peo-
<lb break="no"/>pled the circumambient air—if shapes they could be call-
<lb break="no"/>ed that were without a form or substance. I was in the
<lb/>heart of Nature, and I saw how the progress of decay
<lb/>was but a preface to another birth—a state of being in
<lb/>which soul was all—I was conscious of an elevation of
<lb/>mind, an expansion of intellect, which rendered the deep-
<lb break="no"/>sought, stored-up knowledge of a thousand generations
<lb/>of men, but as a grain of sand to the earth’s gross bulk—
<lb/>and I saw that those of earth who approached nearest
<lb/>to the imagination of a state of being which in truth
<lb/>surpasses all that the powers of imagination can con-
<lb break="no"/>jure up, were those who in the earnestness of a benefi-
<lb break="no"/>cent nature sought out the Humanities from Wisdom’s
<lb/>page, and blending both, saw nature through the heart
<lb/>and mind—neither with the misjudging warmth of the
<lb/>enthusiast, nor the fact-deducing coldness of the philo-
<lb break="no"/>sopher—but offering at her shrine the uttermost attain-
<lb break="no"/>able refinement of intellect, warmed by the Spirit of an-
<lb break="no"/>gelic Love! I saw through the world, man yearning un-
<lb break="no"/>ceasingly to rise, the soul warring with its human-be-
<lb break="no"/>ing clay, and striving ever to sever from it—the pale
<lb/>student in his midnight study, burying the recollection
<lb/>of the miseries of the by-gone day, forgetting the want</p><p></p><p>of friends, the cold repulse, the unappreciation, the
<lb/>want of sympathy, the hungering morrow, in his ab-
<lb break="no"/>sorbing loye of the truth—the haughty statesman retir-
<lb break="no"/>ing from the admiring crowd, and seeking consolation
<lb/>in seclusion from those aspiring but baseless hopes that
<lb/>sought to raise the herd from its desperate besotted
<lb/>state,—repaid by revilement, scorn, and disbelief, by
<lb/>that very class he sought to benefit;—and, seeking in that
<lb/>solitude deep commune with his own heart, he sought to
<lb/>work out, from the philosophy of the past and the sad
<lb/>experience of the present, a state of mind in which the
<lb/>desire of dispensing happiness should be of itself suffi-
<lb break="no"/>cient compensation apart and independent of the recep-
<lb break="no"/>tion of the benefit by the object of it. Thus deeply pon-
<lb break="no"/>dering and in secret, the quiet came upon his soul and
<lb/>he became of us. I cannot describe to you the nameless
<lb/>feeling that possessed me at those times—there was a
<lb/>consciousness of existence, without its cares; of know-
<lb break="no"/>ledge without the blindness of prejudice which ever ac-
<lb break="no"/>companies our earthly wisdom. I felt that I was apart
<lb/>from the world, yet of it; for that sympathy which per-
<lb break="no"/>vades all nature, which binds heart to heart, and is the
<lb/>medium through which human sensations and affections
<lb/>are felt alike and conveyed throughout the universe now
<lb/>and forever, was acting upon my spirit with a mighty
<lb/>force; my nature was etherealized, and I was in an im-
<lb break="no"/>palpable though sentient link of that wondrous harmoni-
<lb break="no"/>zer of creation, Sympathy or Love! And you were there,
<lb/>my brother;—our spirits met in that bright star with
<lb/>which we have so oft imagined that our fates were inse-
<lb break="no"/>parably connected.”</p><p></p><p>“Stay, Marian, dearest, thou dost remember me, that
<lb/>as I lay upon my bed of sickness, I had a dream of a
<lb/>most terrible and strange import. I know that for days
<lb/>I lay unconscious of all, save of an intolerable and ra-
<lb break="no"/>ging fever, that seemed to dry up all moisture in my
<lb/>blood and brain. I seemed to breathe hot air, which, in
<lb/>its passage, dried up my tongue, and parched and crack-
<lb break="no"/>ed my livid lips. Day and night revolved, but Time
<lb/>seemed to have stayed its course. Each day, as it broke,
<lb/>brought with it an increasing but nameless terror, which,
<lb/>ever and anon, like unto ice-strings made each trembling
<lb/>nerve; and, though the fury of a thousand fires leaped
<lb/>through each vein, my heart felt chill. On that night
<lb/>which caused thee so much terror, this harassing feeling
<lb/>was upon me, and grappled me with a giant’s hand; nor
<lb/>could I fortify myself against it, for my mind seemed to
<lb/>have lost the power of connecting ideas of any kind;—all
<lb/>was vagueness and dread. As the night wore on, the in-
<lb break="no"/>creasing stillness added a new terror to my mind. Me-
<lb break="no"/>thought I lay chained and immovable in the midst of a
<lb/>vast sandy plain, over which the hot sun was vertical—
<lb/>throughout the day, from morn till night, he poured his
<lb/>fierce beams upon my seething skin, until I felt it crack
<lb/>and gape like the parched earth; and when the sun had
<lb/>set, the moon’s rays and the beams of the golden stars
<lb/>seemed to have fire that scorched my brain to madness.
<lb/>There was no rest for me, night nor day—my fevered
<lb/>tongue could not give out my agony. And I was alone in
<lb/>my suffering—when suddenly a mighty form approached.
<lb/>It was of a grave but beautiful aspect—and on its brow
<lb/>there was a calm that chilled at once my burning blood.
<lb/>It seemed as if it had never known a youth, nor could
<lb/>know age—it was not the calm of thought, nor the pas-
<lb break="no"/>siveness of overwhelming grief, but I felt at once that it
<lb/>was the cold, eternal calm of Death. Nearer it came on,
<lb/>and my soul recoiled at its approach. Nearer, still near-</p><p><pb n="210" break="no" />
</p><p>er—it had gained my feet, when in a moment the cells of
<lb/>memory gave up their treasured store. Father, mother,
<lb/>friends came flocking around me—our happy home and
<lb/>childish sports; each happy hour, that in its passage bore
<lb/>a pleasant thought; snatches of old wild melodies, and
<lb/>all the thousand things that endeared and made a joy of
<lb/>life, rushed forth to keep the dreaded terror off,—but in
<lb/>vain! It paused not in its career—it raised its hands
<lb/>above me—a cold sweat stood upon my brow—I strove to
<lb/>speak, but no sound came forth—and struggled to arise, 
<lb/>but the mighty spell withheld me, and I was sinking fast, 
<lb/>Slowly the withering hand descended towards my heart, 
<lb/>—already did I feel its grasp stilling the pulse of life,— 
<lb/>my soul paused, wavering, ere it took its flight, when on 
<lb/>the still night air the deep and fervent prayers of thy in-
<lb break="no"/>nocent heart arose, and from the orbed heaven rushed
<lb/>forth a radiant form, and stood between me and my dread-
<lb break="no"/>ed foe”—</p><p>“My brother! I saw that star fall!"

The Broken Vow and Other Poems. By Amanda M. Ed-
mond. Boston: Gould, Kendall if Lincoln.
</p><p>An octavo of more than 320 pages, beautifully printed
<lb/>on fine paper, “embellished” with six expensive steel en-
<lb break="no"/>gravings (including a portrait of the authoress,) and
<lb/>showily as well as substantially bound.</p><p></p><p>The name—Amanda-M. Edmond—is quite unknown to
<lb/>us: although if we may judge from the number of poems
<lb/>contained in the volume (110) the fair poetess must have
<lb/>been for several years before the public. Perhaps, how- 
<lb/>ever, she may have employed a nom-de-plume, or written 
<lb/>altogether anonymously. We do not remember having
<lb/>before seen any one poem of the collection. They are by
<lb/>no means impressive. The subjects, generally, are such
<lb/>as find favor in boarding-schools. Many of the pieces
<lb/>are on abolition topics. Some of them, from their charac-
<lb break="no"/>ter, have no right to the title of poem, and should not
<lb/>have been included in the volume: we refer to such
<lb/>things as “Washing-Day” and “Illi cui Carmina appli-
<lb break="no"/>cent"—mere doggrel. In the minor merits Miss Edmond
<lb/>is not particularly deficient. Her English, her versifica-
<lb break="no"/>tion, and her imagery, are at least respectable—but in
<lb/>the virtues of the Muse—in the loftier and distinctive at-
<lb break="no"/>tributes, we are pained to say that she is totally want-
<lb break="no"/>ing. We look in vain throughout her volume for one
<lb/>spark of poetic fire. In justice, we cull what we con-
<lb break="no"/>sider the best specimen of her powers:</p><p>THE MOON.
Beautiful moon! oh, how I love to hail
Thy glorious coming in the eastern sky,
When starry gems along thy pathway lie,
Trembling and turning in thy presence pale;
Brightest adorner of Night’s pensive brow,
Fairest of all her radiant jewels, tbou!
Wreathing with light the fleecy cloud that veils
With its thin mantle, for a little space,
The full-orbed lustre of thy beaming face—
Casting thy splendor on the sleeping dales,
Fields, woods and waters that beneath thee rest,
With Night’s dark shadows on thy peaceful breast—
Oh, I do love thee! but the most, sweet moon,
In the still hour of midnight’s sacred noon;
Calm then are spirits that with day have striven,
And Earth's repose seems kin to that of Heaven!
We have said that the English of Miss Edmond is ge- 
</p><p>nerally respectable; but in the very first sentence of the
<lb/>Preface there is an ambiguity which, in a second edition,
<lb/>should be cleared up. “A poetical contribution” says
<lb/>the poetess, “offered to the public, presupposes in the
<lb/>author the existence of the true spirit of song.” Now a
<lb/>poetical contribution, so offered, presupposes in the au-
<lb break="no"/>thor only about the ten thousandth part of what Miss Ed-
<lb break="no"/>mond (no doubt through mere grammatical inadvertence)
<lb/>has maintained it to presuppose. The “poetical contri-
<lb break="no"/>bution” presupposes in the author not the existence but
<lb/>the conviction of the existence, of “the true spirit of
<lb/>song”—and here there is about the same difference as
<lb/>between Peter Schlemil and his Shadow.</p><p>Oracles from the Poets: A Fanciful Diversion for the
Drawing-Room. By Caroline Grilman. New-York:
Wiley if Putnam.
</p><p>This is the third edition of a book which has been ex-
<lb break="no"/>ceedingly popular, and justly so. Nothing could be bet-
<lb break="no"/>ter adapted for the amusement of an evening party.—
<lb/>The game is composed of fourteen questions with sixty
<lb/>answers each, numbered. The Oracle, for example, de-
<lb break="no"/>mands of a gentleman—“What is the personal appear-
<lb break="no"/>ance of her who loves you ?” The gentleman answers
<lb/>with any number from 1 to 60—say 20. Turning to 20,
<lb/>the oracle reads as follows, from Washington Allston:
<lb/>Every thought and feeling throw
<lb/>Their shadows o’er her face,</p><p>And so are every thought and feeling joined,
’Twere hard to answer whether thought or mind
Of either were the native place.
The volume is beautifully printed and bound, and forms
a most appropriate present.

XXV. Table-Talk. By William Hazlitt. Second
 Series Part I.
</p><p>Of the first series of the Table-Talk we spoke so fully
<lb/>in a previous number, that it will be needless to say any-
<lb break="no"/>thing of the second—which is, of course, a continuation.</p><p></p><p>In lieu of any comments from ourselves, therefore, we
<lb/> make a quotation of some length, on a topic of deep in-
<lb break="no"/>terest treated as only Hazlitt could treat it:</p><p></p><p>Capacity is not the same thing as genius. Capacity may be
<lb/>described to relate to the quantity of knowledge, however acquired;
<lb/>genius to its quality and the mode of acquiring it. Capacity is
<lb/>a power over given ideas or combinations of ideas; genius is the
<lb/>power over those which are not given, and for which no obvious
<lb/>or precise rule can be laid down. Or capacity is power of any
<lb/>sort: genius is power of a different sort from what has yet been
<lb/>shown. A retentive memory, a clear understanding is capacity,
<lb/>but it is not genius. The admirable Crichton was a person of pro-
<lb break="no"/>digious capacity; but there is no proof (that I know of) that he
<lb/>had an atom of genius. His verses that remain are dull and ster-
<lb break="no"/>ile. He could learn all that was known or any subject; he could
<lb/>do anything if others could show him the way to do it. This was
<lb/>very wonderful; but that is all you can say of it. It requires a
<lb/>good capacity to play well at chess ; but alter all, it is a game of
<lb/>skill, and not of genius. Know what you will of it, the under-</p><p></p><p> standing still moves in certain tracks in which others have trod
<lb/>before it, quicker or slower, with more or less comprehension and
<lb/>presence of mind. The greatest skill strikes out nothing for itself,
<lb/>from its own peculiar resources; the nature of the game is a thing
<lb/>determinate and fixed; there is no royal or poetical road to check-
<lb break="no"/>mate your adversary. There is no place for genius but in the in-
<lb break="no"/>definite and unknown. The discovery of the binomial theorem
<lb/>was an effort of genius: but there was none shown in Jedediah
<lb/> Buxton’s being able to multiply 9 figures by 9 in his head. If he
<lb/>could have multiplied 90 figures by 90 instead of nine, it would</p><p><pb n="211"/>
</p><p>have been equally useless toil and trouble.* He is a man of ca-
<lb break="no"/>pacity who possesses considerable intellectual riches: he is a man
<lb/>of genius who finds out a vein of new ore. Originality is the
<lb/>seeing nature different from all others, and yet as it is in itself.
<lb/>It is not singularity or affectation, but the discovery of new and
<lb/>valuable truth. All the world do not see the whole meaning of
<lb/>any object they have been looking at. Habit blinds them to some
<lb/>things; short-sightedness to others. Every mind is not a guage
<lb/>and measure of truth. Nature has her surface and her dark re-
<lb break="no"/>cesses. She is deep, obscure, and infinite. It is only minds on
<lb/>whom she makes her fullest impressions that can penetrate her
<lb/>shrine or unveil her Holy of Holies. It is only those whom she
<lb/>has filled with her spirit that have the boldness or the power to re-
<lb break="no"/>veal her mysteries to others. But nature has a thousand aspects,
<lb/>and one man can only draw out one of them. Whoever does this,
<lb/>is a man of genius. One displays her force, another her refine-
<lb break="no"/>ment, one her power of harmony, another her suddenness of con-
<lb break="no"/>trast, one her beauty of form, another her splendor of color. Each
<lb/>does that for which he is best fitted by his particular genius, that
<lb/>is to say, by some quality of mind into which the quality of the
<lb/>object sinks deepest, where it finds the most cordial welcome, is
<lb/>perceived to its utmost extent, and where again it forces its way
<lb/>out from the fulness with which it has taken possession of the
<lb/>mind of the student. The imagination gives out what it has first
<lb/>absorbed by congeniality of temperament, what it has attracted
<lb/>and moulded into itself by elective affinity, as the loadstone draws
<lb/>and impregnates iron. A little originality is more esteemed and
<lb/>sought for than the greatest acquired talent, because it throws a
<lb/>new light upon things, and is peculiar to the individual. The
<lb/>other is common; and may be had for the asking, to any
<lb/>amount.</p><p></p><p>The value of any work is to be judged of by the quantity of
<lb/>originality contained in it. A very ltttle of this will go a great
<lb/>way. If Goldsmith had never written anything but the two or
<lb/>three first chapters of the Vicar of Wakefield, or the character of
<lb/>a Village Schoolmaster, they would have stamped him a man of
<lb/>genius. The Editors of Encyclopedias are not usually reckoned
<lb/>the first literary characters of the age. The works, of which they
<lb/>have the management, contain a great deal of knowledge, like
<lb/>chests or warehouses, but the goods are not their own. We should
<lb/>as soon think of admiring the shelves of a library; but the shelves
<lb/>of a library are both useful and respectable. I was once applied
<lb/>to in a delicate emergency, to write an article on a difficult subject
<lb/>for an Encyclopedia, and was advised to take time and give it a
<lb/>systematic and scientific form, to avail myself of all the knowledge
<lb/>that was to be obtained on the subject, and arrange it with clear-
<lb break="no"/>ness and method. I made answer that as to the first, I had taken
<lb/>time to do all that I ever pretended to do, as I had thought inces-
<lb break="no"/>santly on difierent matters for twenty years of my life; that I had
<lb/>no particular knowledge of the subject in question, and no head
<lb/>for arrangement; and that the utmost I could do in such a case
<lb/>would be, when a systematic and scientific article was prepared, to
<lb/>write marginal notes upon it, to insert a remark or illustration of
<lb/>ray own (not to be found in former Encyclopedias) or to suggest a
<lb/>better definition than had been offered in the text. There are two
<lb/>sorts of writing. The first is compilation; and consists in collect-
<lb break="no"/>ing and stating all that is already known of any question
<lb/>in the best possible manner, for the benefit of the uninformed</p><p></p><p>*The only good thing I ever heard come of this singular man’s
<lb/>faculty of memory was the following. A gentleman was mention-
<lb break="no"/>ing his having been sent up to London from where he lived to see
<lb/>Garrick act. When he went back into the country, he was asked
<lb/>what he thought of the player and the play. “Oh!” he said, “he
<lb/>did not know; he had only seen a little man strut about the stage,
<lb/>and repeat 7956 words.” We all laughed at this, but a person in
<lb/>one corner of the room, holding one hand to his forehead, and
<lb/>seemingly mightily delighted, called out, “Ay, indeed! And
<lb/>Pray, was he found to be correct?” This was the supererogation
<lb/>of literal matter-of-fact curiosity. Jedediah Buxton’s counting the
<lb/>number of words was idle enough; but here was a fellow who
<lb/>wanted some one to count them over again to see that he was cor-
<lb break="no"/>rect.</p><p>“The force of dulness could no farther go!"
Sir Joshua Reynolds being asked how long it had taken him to
do a certain picture, made answer, “All his life.”
</p><p>reader. An author of this class is a very learned amanuensis of
<lb/>other people’s thoughts. The second sort proceeds on an entirely
<lb/>different principle. Instead of bringing down the account of
<lb/>knowledge to the point at which it has already arrived, it pro-
<lb break="no"/>fesses to start from that point on the strength of the writer’s in-
<lb break="no"/>dividual reflections; and supposing the reader in possession of
<lb/>what is already known, supplies deficiencies, fills up certain
<lb/>blanks, and quits the beaten road in search of new tracts of obser-
<lb break="no"/>vation or sources of feeling. It is in vain to object to this last
<lb/>style that it is disjointed, disproportioned, and irregular: It is
<lb/>merely a set of additions and corrections to other men’s works, or
<lb/>to the common stock of human knowledge, printed separately.
<lb/>You might as well expect reasoning in the notes to a book. It
<lb/>skips all the trite, intermediate, level common-places of the subject,
<lb/>and only stops at the difficult passages of the human mind, or
<lb/>touches on some striking point that has been overlooked in pre-
<lb break="no"/>vious editions. A view of a subject, to be connected and regular,
<lb/>cannot be all new. A writer will always be liable to be charged
<lb/>either with paradox or common-place, either with dulness or affec-
<lb break="no"/>tation. But we have no right to demand from any one more than
<lb/>he pretends to. There is indeed a medium in all things, but to
<lb/>unite opposite excellences is a task ordinarily too hard for mortal-
<lb break="no"/>ity. The man who succeeds in what he aims at, or who takes
<lb/>the lead in any one mode or path of excellence, may think himself
<lb/>very well off. It would not be fair to complain of the style of an
<lb/>Encyclopedia as dull, as wanting volatile salt; nor of the style of
<lb/>an Essay because it is too light and sparkling, because it is not a
<lb/>caput mortuvm. So it is rather an odd objection to a work that it is
<lb/>made up entirely of “brilliant passages”—at least it is a fault that
<lb/>can be found with few works, and the book might be pardoned for
<lb/>its singularity. The censure might indeed seem like adroit flat-
<lb break="no"/>tery, if it were not passed on an author whom any objection is suf-
<lb break="no"/>ficient to render unpopular and ridiculous. I grant it is best to
<lb/>unite solidity with show, general information with particular in-
<lb break="no"/>genuity. This is the pattern of a perfect style; but I myself do not
<lb/>pretend to be a perfect writer. In fine, we do not banish light
<lb/>French wines from our tables, or refuse to taste sparkling Cham-
<lb break="no"/>pagne when we can get it, because it has not the body of Old Port.
<lb/>Besides, I do not know that dulness is strength, or that an observa-
<lb break="no"/>tion is slight, because it is striking. Mediocrity, insipidity, want
<lb/>of character, is the great fault. Mediocribus esse poctis non Dii, non
<lb/>homines, non concessére columna. Neither is this privilege allowed
<lb/>to prose-writers in our time, any more than to poets formerly.</p><p></p><p>It is not then acuteness of organs or extent of capacity that con-
<lb break="no"/>stitutes rare genius, or produces the most exquisite models of art,
<lb/>but an intense sympathy with some one beauty or distinguished
<lb/>characteristic in nature. Irritability alone, or the interest taken
<lb/>in certain things, may supply the place of genius in weak and
<lb/>otherwise ordinary minds. As there are certain instruments fitted
<lb/>to perform certain kinds of labor, there arc certain minds so framed
<lb/>as to produce certain chéf-d'æuvres in art and literature, which is
<lb/>surely the best use they can be put to. If a man had all sorts of
<lb/>instruments in his shop, and wanted one, he would rather have
<lb/>that one than be supplied with a double set of all the others. It
<lb/>he had them all twice over, he could only do what he can do as it
<lb/>is, whereas without that one perhaps he cannot finish any one work
<lb/>he has in hand. So if a man can do one thing better than any
<lb/>body else, the value of this one thing is what he must stand or fall
<lb/>by, and his being able to do a hundred other things merely as well
<lb/>as any body else, would not alter the sentence or add to his respec-
<lb break="no"/>tability; on the contrary, his being able to do so many other things
<lb/>well would probably interfere with and encumber him in the exe-
<lb break="no"/>cution of the only thing that others cannot do as well as he, and so
<lb/>far be a drawback and a disadvantage. More people in fact fail
<lb/>from a multiplicity of talents and pretensions, than from an abso-
<lb break="no"/>lute poverty of resources. I have given instances of this else-
<lb break="no"/>where Perhaps Shakspeare’s tragedies would in some respects
<lb/>have been better, if he had never written comedies at all; and
<lb/>in that case his comedies might well have been spared, though
<lb/>they might have cost us some regret. Racine, it is said, might
<lb/>have rivalled Molière in comedy; but he gave up the cultivation
<lb/>of his comic talents to devote himself wholly to the tragic Muse.—</p><p><pb n="212"/>
</p><p>If, as the French tell us, he in consequence attained to the perfec-
<lb break="no"/>tion of tragic composition, this was better than writing comedies
<lb/>as well as Molière and tragedies as well as Crebrillon. Yet I count
<lb/>those persons tools, who think it a pity that Hogarth did not suc-
<lb break="no"/>ceed better in serious subjects. The division of labor is an excel-
<lb break="no"/>lent principle in taste as well as mechanics. Without this, I find
<lb/>by Adam Smith, we could not have a pin made to the degree of
<lb/>perfection it is. We do not, on any rational scheme of criticism,
<lb/>inquire into the variety of a man’s excellences, or the number of
<lb/>his works, or his facility of production. Venice Preserved is suf-
<lb break="no"/>ficient tor Otway’s fame. I hate all those nonsensical stories about
<lb/>Lopez de Vega, and his writing a play in the morning before
<lb/>breakfast. He had time enough to do it alter. If a man leaves
<lb/>behind him any work which is a model in its kind, we have no
<lb/>right to ask whether he could do any thing else, or how he did it,
<lb/>or how long he was about it. All that talent which is not necessa-
<lb break="no"/>ry to the actual quantity of excellence existing in the world, loses
<lb/>its object, is so much waste talent, or talent to let. I heard a sensi-
<lb break="no"/>ble man say, he should like to do some one thing better than all
<lb/>the rest of the world. Why should a man do more than his part?
<lb/>The rest is vanity and vexation of spirit. We look with jealous
<lb/>and grudging eye at all those qualifications which are not essen-
<lb break="no"/>tial; first because they are superfluous, and next, because we sus-
<lb break="no"/>pect they will be prejudicial. Why does Mr. Kean play all those
<lb/>harlequin tricks of singing, dancing, fencing, &amp;c.? They say, “It
<lb/>is for his benefit.” It is not for his reputation. Garrick, indeed,
<lb/>shone equally as well in comedy and tragedy. But he was first,
<lb/>not second-rate in both. There is not a greater impertinence than
<lb/>to ask if a man is clever out of his profession. I have heard of
<lb/>people trying to cross examine Mrs. Siddons. I would as soon try
<lb/>to entrap one of the Elgin Marbles into an argument. Good nature
<lb/>and common sense are required from all people; but one proud
<lb/>distinction is enough for any one individual to possess or to aspire
<lb/>to!</p><p>Of course we admire all this—it is pointedly put—but
we assent to only about one half of it.

<lb/>than an Historical Sketch of it. Force and novelty
<lb/>abound, and we are never permitted to doubt the honesty
<lb/>of the narration, but there is a slight tinge of the whim-
<lb break="no"/>sical about the book which may operate, in the first in-</p><p></p><p>stance, to prevent a very general appreciation of its mer-
<lb break="no"/>its—which are undoubtedly great. By way of exemplifi-
<lb break="no"/>ing our meaning we quote a brief passage from an account
<lb/>of Timothy Pickering.</p><p></p><p>His reputation was that ot a consistent upright man, who lived
<lb/>and died firm to the conviction he cherished; hard but honest.
<lb/>On a great field day debate in 1841, on the Loan Bill, when the
<lb/>House, in committee of the whole, gave six weeks to those speech-
<lb break="no"/>es for political capital at home and abroad, which are among the
<lb/>ways and means of free countries with a free press—much prefer-
<lb break="no"/>able to more serious combats—Mr. Pickering, in the course of his
<lb/>harangue, looking through his spectacles full in the chairman’s
<lb/>face, said, with great emphasis, swinging his long arm aloft, that
<lb/>he stood on a rock. “I stand on a rock’, said he “from which all
<lb/>democracy”—then raising his voice and repeatrng it—“not all
<lb/>democracy and hell to bool, can move me—the rock of integrity and
<lb/>truth."</p><p></p><p>“These things are more honored in the breach than in
<lb/>the observance”—by silence than by historical record.
<lb/>The passage, too, will afford some idea of Mr. Inger-
<lb break="no"/>soll’s style which, like Mr. Pickering’s character, is
<lb/>“hard but honest”—as well as (more definitely) of his
<lb/>mere English, which is loose and uncouth to a very rep-
<lb break="no"/>rehensible degree. Take, for instance, the first para-
<lb break="no"/>graph of the volume:</p><p></p><p>In this historical sketch I shall endeavor to submit the truth in
<lb/>an account of the contest between Great Britain and the United
<lb/>States of America, declared by Act of Congress, approved the 18th
<lb/>of June, 1812. It enacted that war was already declared to exist
<lb/>between the United Kingdoms of Great Britain and Ireland, and
<lb/>the Dependencies thereof, and the U. S. of America and their terri-
<lb break="no"/>tories; and that the President of the U. S. was thereby authorized
<lb/>to use the whole land and naval force of the U. S., to carry the
<lb/>same into effect, and to issue to private armed vessels of the U, S.,
<lb/>commissions, or letters of marque and general reprisal, in such
<lb/>form as he should think proper, and under the seal of the U. S.
<lb/>against the vessels, goods and effects of the government of the said
<lb/>United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and the subjects
<lb/>thereof.</p><p></p><p>Here a “contest” is “ declared.” Whether the “ there-
<lb break="no"/>by” in “thereby unauthorized” refers to the territories,
<lb/>the war, or the act, it is difficult to determine. “The
<lb/>same” is equally ambiguous as regards its reference, and
<lb/>it seems to be the “Seal of the U. S.” which is set
<lb/>“against the vessels, goods and effects” off the British.
<lb/>The whole paragraph is awkward in the extreme.</p><p></p><p>But happily the value of the book does not depend upon
<lb/>trifles such as these. It gives a plain, discerning and evi-
<lb break="no"/>dently faithful view of the events of the war, and will be
<lb/>received with favor by all who are competent to decide

</p><p>National Gallery at the Rotunda.—We proceed
<lb/>to picture No. seven, the second of the Series:—we
<lb/>might say the second page of the History. In this it is
<lb/>evident that society has already made great strides to-
<lb break="no"/>wards civilization. The hunter has long passed away,</p><p>and the shepherd is making room for the husbandman.—
</p><p>The locality is nearly, but not quite the same, as in the
<lb/>last picture; we have still the “boulder” promontory in
<lb/>the distance, but we have shifted our ground, and have
<lb/>moved to the right, and further from the river. Before
<lb/>us stands a group of glorious trees—primeval giants of
<lb/>the forest—beneath whose mighty arms</p><p>The ground was never trenched by spade,
And flowers spring up unseen.
</p><p>On the left rises a gentle hill, on which a ploughman is
<lb/>seen driving his share into the mellow earth, while in
<lb/>the middle distance on the bank of the river, stands an
<lb/>eminence crowned with a Druid’s Temple. At the foot,
<lb/>on a rock, we see a growing little town. White sails
<lb/>are on the sea, an on the shore we see and antique ves-
<lb break="no"/>sel on the stocks. Everything gives indication of an ac-
<lb break="no"/>tive people, yet all are not busy with the ruder cares of
<lb/>life, for the refining arts—Music and Painting—have al-
<lb break="no"/>ready dawned. Beneath the shade of the mighty trees,
<lb/>we see maidens wreathed with flowers, dancing gaily
<lb/>and gracefully to the shepherd’s pipe, and on a huge
<lb/>stone (a rustic bridge) in the foreground, an embryo
<lb/>painter scrawls his first attempt at the pictorial art.—
<lb/>Near him his mother plies the busy spindle, while seat-
<lb break="no"/>ed close at hand, an old man traces in the dust a geomet-
<lb break="no"/>rical figure, indicating the beginning of the abstruser
<lb/>sciences.</p><p></p><p>The contemplation of this charming production carries
<lb/>us back to our boyish dreams of rural felicity all is
<lb/>beauty and joy, and but for the presence of an armed
<lb/>man, passing through the ravine up to the front of the
<lb/>picture, we might suppose it an illustration of the Poet’s
<lb/>“Golden Age.”</p><p></p><p>The painter has chosen, with great propriety, the Dru-
<lb break="no"/>idical circle, as the rude temple of the earliest worship-
<lb break="no"/>pers, while the volumes of smoke which issue from it in-</p><p><pb n="214" break="no" />
dicate that living victims heap the altars of a sanguinary
God.
</p><p>It were tedious to enumerate the thousand little objects
<lb/>which attract our attention, and the many delicate tints,
<lb/>of which words can convey no idea. As well might we
<lb/>attempt to give a description of the exquisite transitions
<lb/>of sound in a fine musical composition, as the delicate
<lb/>gradations of color from the full green of the foreground,
<lb/>to the faint blue haze of the distant landscape. We feel
<lb/>that it would be almost hypercritical to pick out faults in
<lb/>this composition, and yet the station we have assumed
<lb/>calls upon us to display our judgment, by finding fault,
<lb/>otherwise the public may conclude that we are no critics.
<lb/>Well, gentle readers, we will make an effort to gratify
<lb/>you, by wishing that the sheep in the middle ground
<lb/>were of an “improved breed,” as they make the shep-
<lb break="no"/>herd appear too tall.	w.</p><p></p><p>To all lovers of the true and beautiful in art we recom-
<lb break="no"/>mend a visit to the Ivory Christ, brought from Italy by
<lb/>C. Edwards Lester, our Consul at Genoa, and now being
<lb/>exhibited in Broadway opposite the Park. This figure
<lb/>(it cannot properly be called a statue) is the work of an
<lb/>Italian Monk, an educated man, but with little knowl-
<lb break="no"/>edge of art. A deep enthusiasm—an overwhelming pas-
<lb break="no"/>sion to do justice to the intellectual and physical charac-
<lb break="no"/>ter of the God-man, seems to have been in this case at
<lb/>once the instigation and the instruction. The material
<lb/>is the tusk of an antique elephant—a tusk of enormous
<lb/>size. Much of it had to be cut away on account of its ca-
<lb break="no"/>rious condition, and yet the figure is 32 inches long, (we
<lb/>believe) and 8 inches broad through the shoulders:—all
<lb/>this solid—the arms are wrought from separate pieces.</p><p></p><p>The first point noticeable in this Christ is the intellec-
<lb break="no"/>tuality of its expression. All other representations of the
<lb/>Saviour make him merely benevolent, dignified, meek,
<lb/>self-sustained, and beautiful in feature. In this, mind—
<lb/>genius—predominates. The whole face is eminently in-
<lb break="no"/>tellectual.</p><p></p><p>The second thing to be observed is the absolute truth
<lb/>of the entire design. The figure depends from the cross
<lb/>precisely as the human form would depend under the cir-
<lb break="no"/>cumstances. The moment chosen is that immediately
<lb/>succeeding death. We are made to fancy that the last
<lb/>sigh has just issued from his lips—on which is now fa-
<lb break="no"/>ding a divine smile. We can see, nevertheless, that
<lb/>the death has been agonizing. The contraction of
<lb/>the muscles, more particularly about the calves, toes
<lb/>and lumbar regions, are absolute in the truth of their
<lb/>expression. In anatomy the whole figure is perfect. We
<lb/>douht if a better model of the human frame is to be found
<lb/>anywhere. The work altogether is of a very high order
<lb/>of genius.</p><p></p><p>In our next we shall endeavor to do justice to the inimi-
<lb break="no"/>table Sortie du Bain—De Kuyper’s—now to be seen at
<lb/>the Society Library. We have no patience with those
<lb/>who decry it.	P.</p><p>Musical Department. 
</p><p>Trinity Church Organ.—Having been favored, by
<lb/>the kindness of Richard Upjohn, Esq., the gifted architect
<lb/>of Trinity Church, with an elegant drawing of the front
<lb/>elevation of the new Organ which will shortly be erect-
<lb break="no"/>ed in that noble edifice, we are enabled this week to af-
<lb break="no"/>ford a similar gratification to our readers, by presenting
<lb/>them with a fine engraving on steel of the same, execu-
<lb break="no"/>ted by James Duthie.</p><p></p><p>In order to render this the more interesting and intelli-
<lb break="no"/>gible, we have procured from Dr. Edward Hodges, who
<lb/>first planned, and now has the oversight and superintend-
<lb break="no"/>ence of the construction of the interior of the ponderous
<lb/>instrument, the following particulars concerning its di-
<lb break="no"/>mensions and intended contents.</p><p></p><p>Of the beautiful and appropriate design of the organ front and
<lb/>subjacent screen, harmonizing as it does with the imposing effect
<lb/>of the interior of the building, I need not say anything; the draw-
<lb break="no"/>ing will speak for itself. The whole is to be of oak, and much of
<lb/>it has already been executed in a most thoroughly substantial and
<lb/>workmanlike manner.</p><p></p><p>The height of the screen to the level of the floor of the organ
<lb/>loft is 14 feet 5 inches; above which the Organ will tower 38 feet
<lb/>farther; making a total elevation of nearly 53 feet.</p><p></p><p>The width of the organ front is 24 feet, but as the floor will be
<lb/>trussed out about 4 feet on each side as well as towards the nave,
<lb/>the width of the organ-loft will be 34 feet—thus affording abund-
<lb break="no"/>ant room for an effective choir, should it be finally resolved to place
<lb/>the choir at that (the wrong) end of the church. This gallery or
<lb/>organ-loft will be surrounded, on three sides, by latticed work to a
<lb/>considerable altitude, as seen in the drawing.</p><p></p><p>The only way to give a just idea of the nature and extent of
<lb/>an Organ, is by stating its leading divisions (e. g. an Organ of
<lb/>two, three, or more ranks of keys,) enumerating the stops, and giv-
<lb break="no"/>ing the magnitudes of the largest pipes connected with each de-
<lb break="no"/>partment, to which all the rest are adjusted in a well known pro-
<lb break="no"/>portional order. Simply to state the number of stops and the
<lb/>number of pipes pertaining to each, can communicate no accu-
<lb break="no"/>rate or satisfactory information; for, as the magnitudes in de-
<lb break="no"/>scending the scale increase in geometrical progression, it may hap-
<lb break="no"/>pen that a dozen pipes in one organ may require and occupy as
<lb/>much room as a thousand pipes in another, or in another part of
<lb/>the same instrument. We cannot estimate the power or effect of
<lb/>an organ, therefore, by the number of its pipes; any more than
<lb/>we could that of a ship of war merely by learning the number of
<lb/>guns she carries, without ascertaining whether they are four
<lb/>pounders or Paixhan sixty-fours. Suffice it then to add here, for
<lb/>the sake of those who have no technical acquaintance with the
<lb/>subject, that the lengths of the pipes intended for the Trinity or-
<lb break="no"/>gan vary from nearly thirty feel to something less than an inch,
<lb/>and the diameters from three feet to the size of a small goose-quill.</p><p></p><p>A custom has obtained amongst organists and organ-builders
<lb/>of naming the pipes and the notes which bear the denomination
<lb/>of the letter C in various octaves of the great scale, by the con-
<lb break="no"/>venient designation of a round number of feet, not precisely accu-
<lb break="no"/>rate as to the actual admeasurement, but near the truth. Thus we
<lb/>speak of 2 feet C, of 4 feet C, See. (each octave doubling the fore-
<lb break="no"/>going;) and when we come to the bottom, of 32 feet C, although,
<lb/>it the pipe be of larger diameter it may not exceed 28 or 29 feet.
<lb/>One cause of this has probably been the successive changes of
<lb/>pitch, to accommodate modern orchestral instruments; which chan-
<lb break="no"/>ges, until a very recent period, were invariably towards the shar-
<lb break="no"/>per or more acute limit of the scale of musical sounds. And, of
<lb/>course, organ-builders have been nothing loath to fall into the pre-
<lb break="no"/>vailing fashion in (his respect, seeing that when the pitch had as-
<lb break="no"/>cended but a single semitone (and it has been supposed to have
<lb/>varied thrice as much,) it lessened the magnitude, the weight, and
<lb/>the cost of any given instrument by at least as much as a twen-
<lb break="no"/>tieth part of the whole. At present a check seems to have been
<lb/>put upon this innovating tendency, and the pitch may be consider-
<lb break="no"/>ed as settled. The public, however, ought to be made aware of the
<lb/>fact that fraud can be practised in this particular, and that the pitch
<lb/>of an organ is not an affair of so small consequence as some per-
<lb break="no"/>sons would represent it to be.</p><p></p><p>There is deception of another species not seldom exercised with
<lb/>regard to this complex instrument. Certain organ-builders, com-
<lb break="no"/>ing to the knowledge of the fact that in the hands of ignorant and
<lb/>unskilful organists, the note G G# in the extreme bass was seldom
<lb/>put in requisition, affected to consider that note as useless, and so
<lb/>omitted it; although, upon an ordinary G G organ this arrange-
<lb break="no"/>ment excluded the largest pipe but one iu every stop. And this</p><p>The Organ of Trinity Church

</p><p>practice (which originated, as candor requires me to confess, in
<lb/>England,) has continued to our day. Many such organs are still
<lb/>built, and advertised for sale—the compass being with audacious
<lb/>effrontery stated to be from G G upwards, without any mention
<lb/>tion made of this most important deficiency. But as long as good
<lb/>people are satisfied to order and purchase organs without any re-
<lb break="no"/>ference to persons competent to afford them professional advice on
<lb/>the subject, they must remain content to be duped.</p><p></p><p>Thus much being premised, the following description may pos-
<lb break="no"/>sibly become tolerably intelligible even to those who have not
<lb/>been initiated in the mysteries of the organ-craft:</p><p></p><p>The Organ for Trinity Church, then, is to consist of four distinct
<lb/>departments, having three ranks of manual keys, and one of pe-
<lb break="no"/>dals, or keys for the feet. The manuals pertain to the Swell, the
<lb/>Great Organ, and the Choir Organ, respectively. The Swell is an
<lb/>organ of 4 ft.; (that, being, as before explained, the size of the
<lb/>longest pipe); the Choir Organ, (seen in front, projecting from the
<lb/>gallery,] an 8 ft. organ; the Great Organ, 16 ft.; the Pedal Organ,

</p><p>The compass or extent of the organs, respectively, is as follows:
<lb/>Of the Swell, four octaves and a half, or fifty-four keys; of the
<lb/>Choir organ, the same, although at an octave lower pitch, the lat-
<lb break="no"/>ter ending at fin alt., the other at f in altissimo; of the Great Or-
<lb break="no"/>gan. five octaves and a half, or sixty-six keys; and of the Pedals,
<lb/>‘wo octaves, or twenty-five keys. In connexion with this latter
<lb/>department there is this peculiarity, that the stop consists of thirty-</p><p></p><p>seven pipes, and can be drawn so as to play two octaves from 32 ft.
<lb/>C, or two octaves from 16 ft. upwards; or both together. The stops
<lb/>called “Swell Bass” are also, properly speaking, pedal stops, al-
<lb break="no"/>though they can be acted upon by the manual keys also, so as to
<lb/>afford a great variety of effect.</p><p>The number of pipes can now be easily ascertained.

</p><p>The Swell is constructed upon the plan which I first introduced
<lb/>in England about twenty years ago, and a full description of which
<lb/>I drew up and published in the "(Quarterly Musical Magazine &amp;
<lb/>Review," vol. 8, No. xxxii., 1826. It may be briefly described as
<lb/>resembling in principle the ordinary refrigerator. It consists of
<lb/>three distinct boxes or cases, through each of which (when closed)
<lb/>the sound has to pass ere it reaches (he ear. Thus the most deli-
<lb break="no"/>cate effects, in the way of expression, are capable of being produ-
<lb break="no"/>ced, by the gradual removal or interposition of obstacles to the
<lb/>transmission of sound.</p><p></p><p>The Pedal keys likewise are as yet comparatively new in this
<lb/>country, being of brass. These I likewise introduced in England a
<lb/>year or two prior to my new swell, and described in No. xxxii of
<lb/>the periodical just mentioned. They must gradually make their
<lb/>way into extensive use, as they afford great facilities to the player,
<lb/>enabling him to do a great deal more with one foot than wa3 before
<lb/>at all practicable, and thus setting the other at liberty for the com-
<lb break="no"/>mand of the swell.</p><p></p><p>The number of coupling stops in the organ is, I believe, almost
<lb/>if not altogether unprecedented. They will conduce to almost in-
<lb break="no"/>terminable varieties of combinations. It would be a wearisome
<lb/>task to attempt to calculate them. There will, therefore, be great
<lb/>room for the exhibition of taste and skill in their adaptation to spe-
<lb break="no"/>cific purposes of accompaniment, &amp;c.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Henry Erben is the contractor, and the work has already
<lb/>made very considerable progress, nearly all the machinery of the
<lb/>organ being in a state of forwardness, at his spacious and well-
<lb break="no"/>furnished factory in Centre street. The workmen employed de-
<lb break="no"/>serve great credit for the masterly manner in which they have ac-
<lb break="no"/>quitted themselves hitherto in the construction of this unique in-
<lb break="no"/>strument; and if the voicing of the pipes (not commenced) shall
<lb/>prove as satisfactory as the mechanism unquestionably is, the pub-
<lb break="no"/>lic may expect to hear an organ which will add to the attractions
<lb/>of this great city.</p><p></p><p>I am afraid that my description will be found tediously long;
<lb/>but, like the witty Frenchman who apologized to his friend for
<lb/>sending him so long a letter, I must say that I had not time to
<lb/>write it shorter.	E. H.</p><p></p><p>Ole Bull’s Second Concert.—We attended the second

<lb/>poorly attended. The vast area of the Tabernacle con-

</p><p>Mr. Duffield comes to us from the Western country,
<lb/>and the only recommendation we have seen of his talent
<lb/>j is copied from some Westem paper, and concludes with</p><p><pb n="216"/>
</p><p>something to this effect:—“He never sings the song
<lb/>“Fifty years ago” without receiving demonstrations of
<lb/>delight from a buck-eyed auditory.” This is praise con-
<lb break="no"/>siderable, but we do not think it will weigh much with
<lb/>our Northern people. Mr. Duffield has a light, pleasing
<lb/>and melodious voice, but of its compass and power we
<lb/>were unable to judge, for his intonation was so faulty,
<lb/>and his manner so cold and uncultivated, that we rarely
<lb/>heard the true quality of his organ. However, the indi-
<lb break="no"/>cations were sufficient to warrant the opinion, that, with
<lb/>careful and hard study, he may become an ornament to
<lb/>his profession. His last song was “Stand to your guns.”
<lb/>It requires great descriptive powers, a vast deal of ener-
<lb break="no"/>gy, and a most powerful voice. Mr, Duffield, at present,
<lb/>lacks all these qualifications, and consequently the song
<lb/>was a failure. He took the tempo of the song nearly one
<lb/>half too slow; at least, the conductor, Mr. Hill, lead the
<lb/>song off too slow, and the singer followed—but presently
<lb/>Mr. Duffield, by a variety of expressive gestures, intima-
<lb break="no"/>ted his wish that the time should be increased; the con-
<lb break="no"/>ductor took the hint, and communicated the same to the
<lb/>band, which ultimately consented to accede to their uni-
<lb break="no"/>ted wishes.</p><p></p><p>Of Miss Northall we spoke last week, and we saw no
<lb/>reason on this occasion to alter our opinion then express-
<lb break="no"/>ed. She has a most beautiful voice, and we should be
<lb/>delighted to find that she cultivated it to advantage, for
<lb/>she is quite young yet, and has, we hope, many years in
<lb/>prospective which may yield her high honor and large
<lb/>profit. In her last song, with orchestral accompani-
<lb break="no"/>ments, it was really painful to hear how the conductor
<lb/>labored with hands and feet to impress the tempo upon
<lb/>the band, and it was equally painful to observe what very
<lb/>little success attended his efforts.</p><p></p><p>Of Ole Bull we have much to say, both in praise and
<lb/>in condemation. We cannot but admire his adagio per-
<lb break="no"/>formances; they are full of passion and sentiment. His
<lb/>allegros are brilliant and forcible, and his scherzos are
<lb/>piquant and striking; but with all these undoubted ex-
<lb break="no"/>cellences, there is mingled so much of trickery and what
<lb/>is termed professional “gaggery,” that the beauties are
<lb/>often clouded, and sometimes quite obscured. Many of
<lb/>his peculiarities are undoubtedly the natural impulse of
<lb/>his genius, which is nothing if not wildly eccentric; but
<lb/>there are others which display no other intention than to
<lb/>tickle the ears, without appealing to the mind.</p><p></p><p>Ole Bull was wretchedly accompanied; we really felt
<lb/>for him. He tried all he could to lead the conductor by
<lb/>gesture and cue, but they were mostly at difference, and
<lb/>the band differed from both, producing confusion worse
<lb/>confounded.	——</p><p></p><p>The Musical Convention had its sitting this week at

<lb/>Can any of our readers help us out?</p><p></p><p>Poe-lemical.—In the last number of the Broadway Journal, the
<lb/>critical and learned editor reiterates his opinion of Mr. Simms,
<lb/>whom he considers the “best novelist that this country has, upon
<lb/>the whole produced.” Mr. Poe seems to have quite an original
<lb/>and peculiar standard of judging of the merits of men and books.
<lb/>Success is the common measure of talent, not only in regard to the
<lb/>productions of literary men, but in business also, in works of art
<lb/>or of usefulness; and in all the varied pursuits of life. It is the
<lb/>victory that coolers fame on the hero, father than brave bearing,
<lb/>and manly courage on the battle-field. We are too apt to look at
<lb/>results merely, and to honor and praise the successful, rather than
<lb/>the meritorious man. In business, the millionare, into whose lap
<lb/>fortune has poured her treasures, and to whose prosperity the winds
<lb/>of heaven have seemed subservient, gains with his wealth the re-
<lb break="no"/>putation of being wiser and shrewder than his competitors, who
<lb/>may perhaps have struggled harder, and reasoned better, and yet
<lb/>been thwarted in their efforts beyond avoidance or control. And
<lb/>in literature, also, the popular man, is the great man,—the author
<lb/>who sells best—who is most read—and oftenest quoted,—he is the
<lb/>man whom the people will honor in spite of all the critics. But
<lb/>then one class of philosophers tell us that the judgment of the mil-
<lb break="no"/>lion is always wrong—that the great majority of men, blinded by
<lb/>passion, and swayed by prejudice, are wholly incapable of deciding
<lb/>in matters of taste or morals, in politics or religion. On the other
<lb/>hand, there are many learned Thebans,” who as strenuously
<lb/>maintain that the voice of the multitude is the voice of truth and
<lb/>God; and that in all cases it is the duty of the minority to acqui-
<lb break="no"/>esce in the verdict of the people. Here, we take it, is the great
<lb/>rock on which politicians, moralists, and critics split and separate.
<lb/>Leaving this primal question as undecided as it is likely to remain
<lb/>until the “World’s Convention” shall eradicate from human na-
<lb break="no"/>ture all the causes which lead to differences in the opinions of men,
<lb/>we are inclined to believe that it is above the power of any single
<lb/>critic—or of all the critics in the country combined, to convince
<lb/>the world that William Gilmore Simms is a better novelist than
<lb/>Cooper, or Brockden Brown. He is certainly less known and read
<lb/>at home and abroad. We doubt if the copy-right of all Mr.
<lb/>Simms’ collected works would bring as good a price in America
<lb/>or England, as the "Norman Leslie” of Fay, or the "Sketch
<lb/>Book” of Irving. But our surprise at Mr. Poe’s estimate is some-
<lb break="no"/>what diminished, when, on turning to another article, we find him
<lb/>speaking of our old friend, “Christopher North,” as “the ignorant
<lb/>and egotistical Wilson!” and adding, that, “with the exception
<lb/>of Macaulay and Dilke, and one or two others, there is not in
<lb/>Great Britain a critic who can be fairly considered worthy the
<lb/>name!" This is indeed, “bearding the lion in his den;” and as
<lb/>Mr. Poe is preparing to publish an edition of his "Tales" in
<lb/>England, (omitting the story of the Gold Bug, we suppose,) he can
<lb/>expect but little mercy from the Amir-biting reviews of the Lock-
<lb break="no"/>harts and Fonblanques, those bull-dogs of the English press. It is,
<lb/>however, a matter of some pride that we have, at least, one critic,
<lb/>who is brave and Quixotic enough to attack any wind-mill, either
<lb/>in Europe or America, however formidable it may appear; and
<lb/>our good wishes go with our valiant neighbor.</p><p></p><p>Mr. (or Mrs.) Star suggests here first, (if we are not
<lb/>mistaken) that success is (or is not) the test of merit, and
<lb/>secondly, that it is not (or is). Are we right in this in-
<lb break="no"/>terpretation? No doubt of it.</p><p></p><p>The separation of our passage about Mr. Simms from
<lb/>its context, brings about a total misrepresentation of our
<lb/>ideas.</p><p>Mr. Simms is “better known” than Brockden Brown.
</p><p>Putting the author of “Norman Leslie” by the side of
<lb/>the author of the “Sketch-Book,” is like speaking of
<lb/>“The King and I”—of Pop Emmons and Homer—of a
<lb/>Mastodon and a mouse. If we were asked which was
<lb/>the most ridiculous book ever written upon the face of
<lb/>the earth—we should answer at once, “Norman Leslie.”</p><p>We are not “preparing to publish” our Tales in Eng-
<pb n="217" break="no" />
</p><p>land; we leave such manoeuvres to
<lb/>those who are in the habit of bowing
<lb/>down to the Golden Calf of the British
<lb/>opinion. Our book, to be sure, has been
<lb/>re-published in England—long ago—
<lb/>but we had nothing to do with its re-
<lb break="no"/>publication, Should we ever think of
<lb/>such a thing, however, we should un-
<lb break="no"/>doubtedly give The “Bug” a more pro-
<lb break="no"/>minent position than it even occupies at
<lb/>present. We should call the book “The
<lb/>Gold-Bug and Other Tales”—instead
<lb/>of “Tales,” as its title stands. How-
<lb break="no"/>ever highly we respect Mr. Willis’ ta-
<lb break="no"/>lents, we feel nothing but contempt for
<lb/>his affectations.</p><p></p><p>But we have a curiosity to solve the

PUBLISH THIS DAY,
Elements of Morality and Polity.
BY PROF. WHEWELL.
</p><p>THIS valuable new production, from the pen of
<lb/>one if the most eminent scholars of the age,
<lb/>exhibits, in a most lucid, exact, and elegant style,
<lb/>the great principles of moral, political, and ecclesi-
<lb break="no"/>astical science in a far more complete and methodi-
<lb break="no"/>cal manner than has ever met been presented to the
<lb/>Public. In offering this great work to the American
<lb/>reader, the publisher begs leave to introduce it as
<lb/>the commencement- of a new and a tractive series
<lb/>of sterling books, to be issued by them, under the
<lb/>general designation of</p><p>HARPER’S NEW MISCELLANY;
the volumes of which will be legibly printed, in
duodecimo, on fine paper, and
Bound, in extra Muslin Gilt—Price
Fifty Cents a Volume,
</p><p>and issued at short intervals. To render accessible
<lb/>to the million, the fullest advantages of popular in-
<lb break="no"/>struction in the various divisions of human know-
<lb break="no"/>ledge, is tile design of the above series. It is appa-
<lb break="no"/>rent in the present day, that books of intrinsic value
<lb/>are demanded by the people. Formerly the popu-
<lb break="no"/>lar taste preferred mainly works of mete amusement
<lb/>—the great body of readers now seek them as vehi-
<lb break="no"/>cles of general knowledge books of a more per-
<lb break="no"/>manently valuable caste—devoted to some of the
<lb/>departments of science, or general literature. A
<lb/>new race has sprung up, glowing with the first
<lb/>energies of youth, requiring more expanded ideas
<lb/>of the world in  which they live, and a more reliable
<lb/>and well-digested knowledge of the men. and the
<lb/>events of other times and countries. A class of
<lb/>books expressly adapted to this demand, it is the
<lb/>aim of the publishers to supply; and at a price so
<lb/>exceedingly cheap that every person of ordinary
<lb/>taste and advantages may thus become possessed
<lb/>of a</p><p>Complete Library of the Best Litera-
ture of the Age.
</p><p>In this collection it is intended to include the ben
<lb/>productions in every department of knowledge;
<lb/>popular philosophical treatises on topics of univer ’
<lb/>sal interest; the most compact and brilliant histori-
<lb break="no"/>cal books; valuable biographical memoirs; modern
<lb/>voyages and travels, See.; together with scientific
<lb/>and other collateral divisions; in the selection of
<lb/>all which, the most careful discrimination will be
<lb/>observed A mere glance over the wide domain of
<lb/>our English literature will exhibit much yet unex-
<lb break="no"/>plored and uncultivated, from which might be ga-
<lb break="no"/>thered the fruits of a rich, luxuriant harvest; besides
<lb/>which, the ever-teeming issues of the European
<lb/>press open a vast revenue of literary wealth, from
<lb/>which the above collection may be liberally suppli-
<lb break="no"/>ed. Original productions from American writers
<lb/>will also occasionally be introduced. In submitting,
<lb/>therefore, the esteemed work of Prof. Whewell
<lb/>as a kind of first fruits of their New Miscellany,”
<lb/>the publishers deem it only necessary to add, that
<lb/>their arrangements for carrying forward the enter-
<lb break="no"/>prise being of the most complete and efficient kind,
<lb/>hey confidently rely upon their efforts being met
<lb/>with a ready response from the entire reading com-
<lb break="no"/>munity.</p><p></p><p>This, they venture to believe, will be insured to
<lb/>the r Miscellany, no less from the intrinsic value
<lb/>if the collection, than from its unparalleled economy; each volume being elegantly produced, bound</p><p>IN HANDSOME AND SUBSTANTIAL STYLE. FITTED WITH'
JUT FARTHER EXPENSE FOR PERMANENT PRESERVA-
</p><p>tion in the library; the whole series being issued
<lb/>in uniform binding, while the price of each volume

J, F. BROWNE &amp; CO.
MANUFACTURER OF THE
IMPROVED PATENT DOUBLE-ACTION HARP,
By Royal Letters Patent, London. Established 1810. (Many years with Erard.
JF. BROWNE respectfully informs his Friends and the Musical World, that he has established himself for the manufacture
• and importation of these very beautiful instruments, at
281 BROADWAY, and 73 1-2 CHAMBERS STREET.
His arrangements are such as to enable him to transact business at European prices, thereby saving purchasers the high duties
imposed by Tariff on these Instruments.
</p><p>J. F. Browne would observe, these Harps are constructed on the most approved principles, with all the modern improvements of
<lb/>London and Paris, are unequalled in brilliancy of tone, fineness of touch, and perfectness of mechanism. Particular care is taken
<lb/>to fit them for the extremes of climate in this country, in which respect they will be found far superior to any of European manufac-
<lb break="no"/>ture, imported in the usual way.</p><p>These Harps are patronized by the elite of musical taste and professional talent in Europe; among the latter, he would mention
N. C. Boscha, who invariably selects from this establishment.
J. F. Browne begs to offer the opinions of some of the first professional talent in this country.
</p><p>Mr. J. F. Browne, Sir Having had for several years past, the opportunity of making a professional use of your Harps, and of
<lb/>testing their qualities, it affords me pleasure to certify, that in point of tone, workmanship, and above all, a solidity that stands proof
<lb/>against the inconstancy of our trying climate, they have in all cases given me the most entire satisfaction.</p><p>January, 1845.	I am yours, CHARLES THIBAULT, No. 40 Beach St., N. Y.
</p><p>Dear Sir I write to express the delight I experienced in performing on one of your Harps at Sig. Casella’s Concert in this city —
<lb/>The mechanism is perfect, and the quality of Tone certainly superior to any harp I have heard for many years. I remember my old
<lb/>Master, Boscha, always gave the preference to your Harps, indeed he himself used no other. Yours most truly, H. G. TRUST
<lb/>Philadelphia, March 4th, 1844.</p><p></p><p> Mr. J. F. Browne, Sir I have much pleasure in saying, that the Harp of your make I performed on at the St. George’s Society
<lb/>Concert, is, in brilliancy of tone, touch, and elegance of workmanship, the finest I ever played on. This will apply to all your Harps.
<lb/>The grand six and a half Gothic Double action, is a most splendid instrument. Yours, with respect, ELIZABETH SLOMAN.
<lb/>New York, January 16th, 1845.	A pupil of N.C. Boscha</p><p></p><p>Mr. J. F. Browne, Sir Having at your request closely scrutinized your double-action Harps, I find they possess the best quali-
<lb break="no"/>ties of the first makers in Europe combined. That in the ease of touch, by which the most brilliant tone is obtained in perfection and
<lb/>ease of modulation, they arc superior to any I have used; their elegance of exterior must gratify the most refined taste Your new
<lb/>Grand Gothic six and a half octave, is the most splendid effort of art yet produced in the musical world; it will give me great pleasure
<lb/>in recommending your Harps at every opportunity.	Yours Truly, HENRY HORN</p><p>January 12th, 1845.	An eminent professor, and Member of the Royal Academy.
</p><p>These are but a very small part of the testimonials received, but will suffice to show the estimate of persons every wav capable of
<lb/>making a correct decision. J. F. Browne has also received the Franklin Medal of the Society of Arts, Philadelphia for his splendid
<lb/>improvements in this delightful Instrument.	</p><p>Harps from 300 to 1000 dollars. Harps repaired, strings, &amp;c.
