SPENDING MONEY FOR WORTHLESS OBJECTS.
</p><p>If men would always insist on having the worth of their
<lb/>money, according to their own standard of value, there would
<lb/>no longer be such a word as poverty in common use. Paying
<lb/>more for a thing than it is worth is as injurious to the seller
<lb/>as to the buyer, for it stimulates unprofitable industry, and
<lb/>leads to the production of articles which develope neither
<lb/>our mental nor physical resources. Perhaps there is no
<lb/>stronger, or more indisputable evidence of this truth, than
<lb/>that afforded by the picture dealing of Italy. By some
<lb/>strange freak of the mind of cultivated Europe, which it is
<lb/>difficult to trace to its origin, a monstrously fictitious value
<lb/>has been, for the last hundred years, attached to old paint-
<lb break="no"/>ings, and above all others to old Italian paintings. Italy,
<lb/>which was once the exclusive home of art, has become, un-
<lb break="no"/>der the effects of this false taste, the most degraded of all
<lb/>the schools of art in the world; all her intellect and indus-
<lb break="no"/>try have been wasted upon the production of works to gratify
<lb/>the morbid tastes of picture fanciers, until she has long since
<lb/>abandoned all attempts at improvement and rests satisfied
<lb/>with furbishing up and imitating the productions of her in-
<lb break="no"/>fancy. Under a delusion like this everything like truth and
<lb/>honesty must of course be smothered, and in their place chi-
<lb break="no"/>canery, deception, and lying flourish. A mind bent upon de-
<lb break="no"/>ception cannot give birth to anything like greatness in art,
<lb/>and it is by no means difficult to understand why the Ital-
<lb break="no"/>ians, who once produced the most glorious examples in art,
<lb/>should now be fallen beneath every other nation in the world
<lb/>in their artistic efforts.</p><p></p><p>The last number of the Foreign Quarterly Review con-
<lb break="no"/>tains a very learned and pleasant article on Pictures and Pic-
<lb break="no"/>ture dealing, being a review of the Catalogue of the gallery
<lb/>of Cardinal Fesch, who appears to have been one of the most
<lb/>extensive picture buyers of his own or any other age.</p><p></p><p>Ho began to form his museum in France, when the property cast
<lb/>loose by the Revolution, and the spoils of half Europe, were to be
<lb/>gathered with little trouble, and at moderate cost. Having after-
<lb break="no"/>wards, in common with the rest of his family, found that country no
<lb/>longer a licensed residence, ho naturally sought a home in the me-
<lb break="no"/>tropolis of his church, and on transporting his pictures to Rome, he
<lb/>stipulated for their removal, at pleasure, from the papal states, ex-
<lb break="no"/>empt from the usual restrictions or export duties. To the choice
<lb/>productions of the ultra-montane schools which the collection already
<lb/>possessed, the constant augmentations which it subsequently re-
<lb break="no"/>ceived added but few gems. And these from Italian pencils. The 
<lb/>cardinal had little more to wish for, eminent rank and ample wealth
<lb/>were his, and the picture-gallery he was intent on forming had at-
<lb break="no"/>tained a European reputation. But the desire of acquisition had
<lb/>become a chronic disease, ever gaining force in its inroads upon his
<lb/>means. Not long before he died he negotiated with one Roman
<lb/>picture-dealer to pay for some indifferent picture with his service of
<lb/>Sevres china, representing the battles of Napoleon, sets of which
<lb/>were made only for the emperor’s nearest relations. To another
<lb/>he gave a set of silver plate by a similar transaction, and at length
<lb/>death itself snatched away the octogenarian from some uncompleted
<lb/>bargains. But his craving for canvass was not to be satiated even
<lb/>by wholesale dealings, which at once added hundreds to his picto-
<lb break="no"/>rial investments. There was an understanding in his household,
<lb/>that for every picture offered at his palace, however execrable in
<lb/>merit or condition, four pauls (about twenty-one pence) were to be
<lb/>at once given. To clean and patch up these, he gave permanent</p><p></p><p>employment to several young restorers, and many were the guesses
<lb/>as to what became of the bargains, after emerging from their hands.
<lb/>During the residence of his nephew, Joseph Bonaparte, in America,
<lb/>it was a common belief that they were shipped to the new world,
<lb/>and there converted into cash. When, on the cardinal’s death,
<lb/>the mystery was revealed, endless repositories of pictures were dis-
<lb break="no"/>covered, the exact number of which has not been, and perhaps
<lb/>could not be, ascertained, but it is estimated at 16,000 or 18,000.</p><p></p><p>We imagine that shipments of old paintings to this coun-
<lb break="no"/>try rarely pay the cost of transportation and the charges of
<lb/>sale. It is by no means uncommon to see warranted Guidos
<lb/>and Corregios sell at less than a dollar, and pictures by the
<lb/>old Dutch masters hardly ever reach higher than half a dollar.
<lb/>So that a profitable speculation might have been made in this
<lb/>country in the life time of the Cardinal by purchasing a lot of
<lb/>undoubted originals and sending them to Rome, where they
<lb/>were sure of commanding four pauls, at least, a price that
<lb/>connot be safely reckoned on in our auction rooms.</p><p></p><p>Italy since the revival of art, has been the great cradle or school of
<lb/>painters for Europe, and a vast proportion of the pictures required
<lb/>for religions or ornamental decoration, has emanated from her stu-
<lb break="no"/>dios, galleries, or churches. From thence came the gems which
<lb/>Charles I. contrived to accumulate, notwithstanding the difficulties
<lb/>of an empty treasury, and a troubled reign. There did the stately
<lb/>Arundel, the earliest English virtuoso, resort. France and Spain,
<lb/>for three hundred years ; England, Germany, and South America,
<lb/>during the last century, have been working the same mine. After
<lb/>the disastrous occupation of Italy by the French, in 1798, and the
<lb/>subsequent convulsions of that ill-fated land, the sword of France
<lb/>and the gold of England combined to cull from her temples and
<lb/>palaces all that was most choice in this branch of art. Since the
<lb/>peace the drain has been continued, and though fewer pieces are
<lb/>now sent out for devotional uses, a new demand of amateurship has
<lb/>arisen from Russia and the United States, nations till then unknown
<lb/>in the market, while England is annually glutted by traffickers in
<lb/>old canvass and cracked panels. Yet the competition of these rival
<lb/>purchasers may, with a little dexterity, be accommodated, as their
<lb/>principles of choice do not by any means clash. The Russian taste
<lb/>in pictures, as in equipages and jewellery, is regulated rather by a
<lb/>semibarbarous magnificence, than by refinement, and their expen-
<lb break="no"/>diture is in proportion to their colossal fortunes. Provided a pic-
<lb break="no"/>ture have the name of a great master, and a corresponding price,
<lb/>the wily Italian owner may almost calculate upon transferring it in
<lb/>the course of the season to some Russian prince, although the sub-
<lb break="no"/>ject be forbidding, the treatment mean, the restorations ill-disguised,
<lb/>or even the authenticity questionable.</p><p></p><p>We think that the reviewer underrates the taste of United
<lb/>States’ Amateurs by classing them with the Russians. It is
<lb/>true that some of our travellers bring home from Rome some
<lb/>of the poorest trash in Italy, for which they probably pay suf-
<lb break="no"/>ficiently high, but generally their prices do not reach much
<lb/>above the minimum of Cardinal Fesch. We saw in the
<lb/>warehouse of a French importer, a short time since, a lot of
<lb/>original paintings, landscapes and devotional pieces, in hand-
<lb break="no"/>some gilt frames, which were offered at twenty dollars the
<lb/>pair at wholesale. This will not be considered surpri ingly
<lb/>cheap for a pair of undoubted originals by the old masters, if
<lb/>the following statement in the Review be correct, as it doubt-
<lb break="no"/>less is, for the writer appears perfectly familiar with his sub-
<lb break="no"/>ject.</p><p></p><p>Of the class of pictures now largely exported to the United States,
<lb/>it may be sufficient to mention, that a commercial traveller in that
<lb/>line, who came to Rome in 1837, had a commission to buy up any
<lb/>painting of whatever subject, or whatever substance, and in what-</p><p><pb n="322" break="no" />
</p><p>ever state, not exceeding the price of sixteen pence! Akin to this
<lb/>is a variety of British Colonial emigration, which may be new to
<lb/>our readers. Chancing to visit lately at the close of the season, the
<lb/>warerooms of an obscure London picture-dealer, we found them
<lb/>encumbered with the refuse of various auction rooms, which had
<lb/>evidently been bought up on this Yankee principle. Whilst gazing
<lb/>in astonishment at the rare conglomerate, we were informed that 
<lb/>they were a speculation for Botany Bay !</p><p></p><p>There is abundant food for thought to our political econo-
<lb break="no"/>mists in the following extract; but we differ altogether with
<lb/>the writer as respects the advantage which Italy has derived
<lb/>from the sale of pictures. The incalculable national wealth,
<lb/>should read incalculable national degradation and poverty.
<lb/>It is not that there is anything hurtful to the health, or mor-
<lb break="no"/>als, in painting pictures: the harm all arises from making
<lb/>pictures to be passed off for what they are not. The Alger-
<lb break="no"/>ines certainly added vast sums of money to their national
<lb/>coffers by their piracies, but it cannot be said that they en-
<lb break="no"/>riched themselves by such gains.</p><p></p><p>There is a consideration suggested by the incredible number of
<lb/>paintings produced in Italy during the last five centuries, which
<lb/>ought not to he lost upon our money-getting generation. The sums
<lb/>which during that long period have been and still are sent there, in
<lb/>payment of exported pictures, have afforded incalculable national
<lb/>wealth. Let not this be forgotten by penny-wise Legislatures, who
<lb/>would measure the beautiful by the scale of utility, and estimate 
<lb/>genius and its highest productions by the returns of the outlay on 
<lb/>their raw material. Let them remember that trifling sums now
<lb/>doled out for the improvement of public taste, and the encourage-
<lb break="no"/>ment of art, are surely and profitably invested; and that nothing but
<lb/>the inadequacy of their amount, can prevent them rapidly yielding
<lb/>an almost usurious interest.—Could our own school of painting be
<lb/>raised to the perfection attained by those of Italy in the sixteenth,
<lb/>and Flanders in the seventeenth centuries, what need were there to
<lb/>send abroad our annual thousands for the purchase of their works! 
<lb/>Or, were our designs as tasteful as the French, why should our
<lb/>neighbours export their fashions and fancy goods, to eclipse ours
<lb/>wherever civilisation has penetrated ? These matters are now be-
<lb break="no"/>ginning to be understood among us; much still remains to be
<lb/>known, and far more to be done : but it is well to have at length
<lb/>entered upon the right path :—sero let it be serio.</p><p></p><p>It is not easy to understand why a gentleman should wish
<lb/>to possess objects of high cost that can give him no pleasure;
<lb/>and yet we see that purchasers of paintings will pay enor-
<lb break="no"/>mous prices for works which they have no capacity to enjoy;
<lb/>an instance of this kind is related by the reviewer which
<lb/>shows a most remarkable combination of simplicity and am-
<lb break="no"/>bition on the part of the purchaser, and of a brilliant imagin-
<lb break="no"/>ation and utter want of honesty on the part of the seller.</p><p></p><p>Among the cleverest of the Roman picture-dealers in Signor A., a
<lb/>most fair-spoken fellow and facetious withal, who, conscious of his
<lb/>own talent, is ever ready to adduce some instance of its happy ex-
<lb break="no"/>ercise. ’Tis but a year or two since he made a wholesale transac-
<lb break="no"/>tion, which, in a short half-hour, transferred to a young Irish peer the
<lb/>accumulated rubbish of his magazine. At the lucky moment of the
<lb/>sailor’s visit, there arrived a liveried servant with an official looking
<lb/>missive, which A. apologised for opening, and after glancing at it,
<lb/>said, ‘ Very good, but I have no time now to look at your pictures;
<lb/>come again.’ The servant hesitated, and to the inquiries of the
<lb/>stranger, A. said it was only the particulars of a lot of pictures
<lb/>which had been sent to him for sale, the heritage of an old Bolog-
<lb break="no"/>nese family, but that he had never had leisure to open the boxes,
<lb/>which must stand over till he could attend to the matter. On his
<lb/>lordship pressing to have a sight of them, A. reluctantly opened the
<lb/>cases, protesting that it was of no use, as it would take much time
<lb/>to clean and arrange and value this collection, before which, of
<lb/>course, the pictures were not for sale. The list exhibited Guidos,
<lb/>Domenichinos, Caraccis, Carlo Dolces,—in short, just that class of
<lb/>names which impose upon an Anglican amateur,—and the dingy
<lb/>canvasses were freely acknowledged to be so completely obscured
<lb/>by dirt and old varnish that their merits were undistinguishable.
<lb/>The more the dealer seemed anxious to divert his customer to the
<lb/>brightly varnished ornaments of his own walls, the less willing was
<lb/>he to lose sight of this singular chance of procuring ‘ a genuine gal-
<lb break="no"/>lery ready made,’ and ere the parties separated, a transfer was made
<lb/>to the peer of a mass of trash which scarcely merited the outlay of
<lb/>cleaning, in exchange for a thousand louis-d’or.</p><p></p><p>Another story is told which displays a much higher reach
<lb/>of imaginative power, and shows a degree of dramatic skill
<lb/>which ought to be turned to a more profitable account than
<lb/>playing tricks upon ignorant travellers.</p><p></p><p>M. Kerschoff, a Russian amateur, was invited to accompany some
<lb/>Florentine gentlemen on a shooting party into the Maremme.
<lb/>Whilst they pursued their sport, he, disgusted by ill-success, re-
<lb break="no"/>turned to wait for them at a cottage where their horses were put
<lb/>up. Having got into conversation with its occupant, the latter in-
<lb break="no"/>quired if his guest was fond of pictures, as he had something curious
<lb/>that might interest him. After a long story how his father had, on
<lb/>his death-bed, confided to him the secret, that a picture concealed
<lb/>in the house was of value sufficient to make the fortune of all his
<lb/>family, but that having been feloniously obtained, it would, if ever
<lb/>shown or sold in that neighbourhood, certainly bring him into
<lb/>trouble—the rustic produced a very pleasing Madonna and Child, in
<lb/>a very antique carved frame, which the Russian cordially admired,
<lb/>and being asked to guess the artist, named Raffaelle. ‘ That,’ said
<lb/>the peasant, ‘was, I do believe, the very one my father mentioned,
<lb/>but you can see if it was so, as he gave me this bit of paper, with
<lb/>the name written in it.’ On the dirty shred there was in fact
<lb/>scrawled ‘ Raffaelle Sanzi ;' and its possessor went on to hint that,
<lb/>being anxious to realize what he knew to be most valuable property,
<lb/>and seeing no great chance of then disposing of it safely, he would
<lb/>accept from him, as a foreigner, a price far below its value. The
<lb/>negotiation thus opened, ended in the Russian offering 35,000 francs,
<lb/>or 1,400l., which after due hesitation was accepted. The prize
<lb/>was huddled into a clothes-bag, and its new master, without wait-
<lb break="no"/>ing to take leave of his friends, started for Florence, and thence
<lb/>hurried on to Rome, lest it should be stopped by the Tuscan gov-
<lb break="no"/>ernment. There he boasted of his acquisition, and showed it to
<lb/>several connoisseurs, who sang its praises, until Signor Vallati, a
<lb/>skilful dealer, whose name will be presently again mentioned,
<lb/>quickly recognized the real artist. It was in fact a beautiful repeti-
<lb break="no"/>tion, with slight variations, of Raffaelle’s famous ‘ Madonna del
<lb/>Gran-duca:’ it was painted by Micheli, who avows that he sold it
<lb/>for 150 crowns; and the shooting-party was a conspiracy by several
<lb/>well-born swindlers to take in their Russian friend ! The latter re-
<lb break="no"/>turned to Florence to seek redress by a prosecution, which was
<lb/>compromised by their returning most of the price. Being curious
<lb/>to see or obtain the subject of so strange a tale, we subsequently
<lb/>inquired for the picture, but were told it might probably bo met
<lb/>with as an original, in some great German collection, having been
<lb/>there resold by the Russian, at a price almost equal to what he had
<lb/>himself originally paid !</p><p></p><p>We have no room for further extracts from this interesting
<lb/>article, but enough has been quoted to show the purchasers
<lb/>of old pictures the risk which they run in buying a work by
<lb/>the old masters. It is next to an impossibility for an Ameri-
<lb break="no"/>can to become possessed of a genuine fine picture by one of
<lb/>the old painters ; and it will be better therefore for all those
<lb/>who are ambitious of decorating their houses with good
<lb/>works of art to give orders to our own artists, who can, in
<lb/>nine cases out of ten, produce better pictures at less prices
<lb/>than those which are now ostentatiously hung up in the par-
<lb break="no"/>lors of many of our wealthy citizens as the works of the “ old
<lb/>masters.” Many of the houses of our rich merchants are dis-
<lb break="no"/>figured by the worst daubs that ever came from Italy or Bel-
<lb break="no"/>gium, while their upholstery and carpets are of the most del-
<lb break="no"/>icate and beautiful workmanship. We are by no means dis-
<lb break="no"/>posed to dampen the ardor of any lover of art; but we have
<lb/>no doubt that an improper outlay of money for unworthy ob-
<lb break="no"/>jects has a greater tendency to depress the interests of true art,
<lb/>than the most stringent parsimony can have. A Wall Street
<lb/>Broker who has recently become rich and liberal, last year
<lb/>purchased a landscape from one of our artists at a generous
<lb/>price, because he liked it. He confessed he was utterly ig-
<lb break="no"/>norant of the technical merits of a picture, but he knew when
<lb/>he was pleased and he was willing to pay for the pleasure.
<lb/>If all purchasers of works of virtu, would be guided by the
<lb/>same principle in their selections, they would be always sure
<lb/>of getting the worth of their money, and merit would gener-
<lb break="no"/>ally receive its reward.</p><p>ELEONORA.
Sub conservatione formae specificae salva anims.
Raymond Lully.
</p><p>I am come of a race noted for vigor of fancy and ardor of
<lb/>passion. Men have called me mad ; but the question is not
<lb/>yet settled, whether madness is or is not the loftiest intelli-
<lb break="no"/>gence—whether much that is glorious—whether all that is
<lb/>profound—does not spring from disease of thought—from</p><p><pb n="323"/>
</p><p>moods of mind exalted at the expense of the general intellect.
<lb/>They who dream by day are cognizant of many things which
<lb/>escape those who dream only by night. In their grey visions
<lb/>they obtain glimpses of eternity, and thrill, in awaking, to
<lb/>find that they have been upon the verge of the great secret.
<lb/>In snatches, they learn something of the wisdom which is 
<lb/>of good, and more of the mere knowledge which is of evil.
<lb/>They penetrate, however rudderless or compassless, into the
<lb/>vast ocean of the “ light ineffable” and again, like the ad-
<lb break="no"/>venturers of the Nubian geographer, “ agressi sunt mare
<lb/>tenebrarum, quid in eo esset exploraturi.”</p><p></p><p>We will say, then, that I am mad. I grant, at least, that
<lb/>there are two distinct conditions of my mental existence—
<lb/>the condition of a lucid reason, not to be disputed, and be-
<lb break="no"/>longing to the memory of events forming the first epoch of
<lb/>my life—and a condition of shadow and doubt, appertaining 
<lb/>to the present, and to the recollection of what constitutes the 
<lb/>second great era of my being. Therefore, what I shall tell 
<lb/>of the earlier period, believe; and to what I may relate of
<lb/>the later time, give only such credit as may seem due; or
<lb/>doubt it altogether; or, if doubt it ye cannot, then play unto
<lb/>its riddle the Oedipus.</p><p></p><p>She whom I loved in youth, and of whom I now pen
<lb/>calmly and distinctly these remembrances, was the sole
<lb/>daughter of the only sister of my mother long departed.
<lb/>Eleonora was the name of my cousin. We had always
<lb/>dwelled together, beneath a tropical sun, in the Valley of
<lb/>he Many-Colored Grass. No unguided footstep ever came 
<lb/>upon that vale; for it lay far away up among a range
<lb/>of giant hills that hung beetling around about it, shutting 
<lb/>out the sunlight from its sweetest recesses. No path was
<lb/>trodden in its vicinity; and, to reach our happy home, there
<lb/>was need of putting back, with force, the foliage of many 
<lb/>thousands of forest trees, and of crushing to death the glories 
<lb/>of many millions of fragrant flowers. Thus it was that we 
<lb/>lived all alone, knowing nothing of the world without the
<lb/>valley,—I, and my cousin, and her mother.</p><p></p><p>From the dim regions beyond the mountains at the upper
<lb/>end of our encircled domain, there crept out a narrow and
<lb/>deep river, brighter than all save the eyes of Eleonora ; and, 
<lb/>winding stealthily about in mazy courses, it passed away, at
<lb/>length, through a shadowy gorge, among hills still dimmer
<lb/>than those whence it had issued. We called it the “ River of
<lb/>Silence for there seemed to be a hushing influence in its
<lb/>flow. No murmur arose from its bed, and so gently it wan- 
<lb/>dered along, that the pearly pebbles upon which we loved to
<lb/>gaze, far down within its bosom, stirred not at all, but lay
<lb/>in a motionless content, each in its own old station, shining
<lb/>on gloriously forever.</p><p></p><p>The margin of the river, and of the many dazzling rivulets
<lb/>that glided, through devious ways, into its channel, as well
<lb/>as the spaces that extended from the margins away down
<lb/>into the depths of the streams until they reached the bed of
<lb/>pebbles at the bottom,—these spots, not less than the whole 
<lb/>surface of the valley, from the river to the mountains that
<lb/>girdled it in, were carpeted all by a soft green grass, thick,
<lb/>short, perfectly even, and vanilla-perfumed, but so be-
<lb break="no"/>sprinkled throughout with the yellow buttercup, the white
<lb/>daisy, the purple violet, and the ruby-red asphodel, that its
<lb/>exceeding beauty spoke to our hearts, in loud tones, of the
<lb/>love and of the glory of God.</p><p></p><p>And, here and there, in groves about this grass, like wil-
<lb break="no"/>dernesses of dreams, sprang up fantastic trees, whose tall
<lb/>slender stems stood not upright, but slanted gracefully to-
<lb break="no"/>wards the light that peered at noon-day into the centre of
<lb/>the valley. Their bark was speckled with the vivid alter-
<lb break="no"/>nate splendor of ebony and silver, and was smoother than
<lb/>all save the cheeks of Eleonora ; so that but for the brilliant
<lb/>green of the huge leaves that spread from their summits in
<lb/>long tremulous lines, dallying with the Zephyrs, one might
<lb/>have fancied them giant serpents of Syria doing homage to
<lb/>their Sovereign the Sun.</p><p></p><p>Hand in hand about this valley, for fifteen years, roamed
<lb/>I with Eleonora before Love entered within our hearts. It
<lb/>was one evening at the close of the third lustrum of her life,
<lb/>and of the fourth of my own, that we sat, locked in each
<lb/>other’s embrace, beneath the serpent-like trees, and looked
<lb/>down within the waters of the River of Silence at our images
<lb/>therein. We spoke no words during the rest of that sweet
<lb/>day ; and our words even upon the morrow were tremulous
<lb/>and few. We had drawn the God Eros from that wave,
<lb/>and now we felt that he had enkindled within us the fiery </p><p></p><p>souls of our forefathers. The passions which had for centu-
<lb break="no"/>ries distinguished our race, came thronging with the fancies
<lb/>for which they had been equally noted, and together breathed
<lb/>a delirious bliss over the Valley of the Many-Colored Grass.
<lb/>A change fell upon all things. Strange brilliant flowers,
<lb/>star-shaped, burst out upon the trees where no flowers had
<lb/>been known before. The tints of the green carpet deepened ;
<lb/>and when, one by one, the white daisies shrank away, there
<lb/>sprang up, in place of them, ten by ten of the ruby-red as-
<lb break="no"/>phodel. And life arose in our paths; for the tall flamingo,
<lb/>hitherto unseen, with all gay glowing birds, flaunted his
<lb/>scarlet plumage before us. The golden and silver fish
<lb/>haunted the river, out of the bosom of which issued, little
<lb/>by little, a murmur that swelled, at length, into a lulling
<lb/>melody more divine than that of the harp of AEolus—sweeter
<lb/>than all save the voice of Eleonora. And now, too, a volu-
<lb break="no"/>minous cloud, which we had long watched in the regions of
<lb/>Hesper, floated out thence, all gorgeous in crimson and gold,
<lb/>and settling in peace above us, sank, day by day, lower and
<lb/>lower, until its edges rested upon the tops of the mountains,
<lb/>turning all their dimness into magnificence, and shutting us
<lb/>up, as if forever, within a magic prison-house of grandeur
<lb/>and of glory.</p><p></p><p>The loveliness of Eleonora was that of the Seraphim; but
<lb/>she was a maiden artless and innocent as the brief life she
<lb/>had led among the flowers. No guile disguised the fervor
<lb/>of love which animated her heart, and she examined with
<lb/>me its inmost recesses as we walked together in the Valley
<lb/>of the Many-Colored Grass, and discoursed of the mighty
<lb/>changes which had lately taken place therein.</p><p></p><p>At length, having spoken one day, in tears, of the last sad
<lb/>change which must befall Humanity, she thenceforward
<lb/>dwelt only upon this one sorrowful theme, interweaving it
<lb/>into all our converse, as, in the songs of the bard of Schiraz,
<lb/>the same images are found occurring, again and again, in
<lb/>every impressive variation of phrase.</p><p></p><p>She had seen that the finger of Death was upon her bo-
<lb break="no"/>som—that, like the ephemeron, she had been made perfect in
<lb/>loveliness only to die; but the terrors of the grave, to her,
<lb/>lay solely in a consideration which she revealed to me, one
<lb/>evening at twilight, by the banks of the River of Silence.
<lb/>She grieved to think that, having entombed her in the Val-
<lb break="no"/>ley of the Many-Colored Grass, I would quit forever its happy
<lb/>recesses, transferring the love which now was so passion-
<lb break="no"/>ately her own to some maiden of the outer and every-day
<lb/>world. And, then and there, I threw myself hurriedly at the
<lb/>feet of Eleonora, and offered up a vow, to herself and to
<lb/>Heaven, that I would never bind myself in marriage to any
<lb/>daughter of Earth—that I would in no manner prove recreant
<lb/>to her dear memory, or to the memory of the devout affec-
<lb break="no"/>tion with which she had blessed me. And I called the
<lb/>Mighty Ruler of the Universe to witness the pious solemnity
<lb/>of my vow. And the curse which I invoked of Him and of
<lb/>her, a saint in Helusion, should I prove traitorous to that
<lb/>promise, involved a penalty the exceeding great horror of
<lb/>which will not permit me to make record of it here. And
<lb/>the bright eyes of Eleonora grew brighter at my words ; and
<lb/>she sighed as if a deadly burthen had been taken from her
<lb/>breast; and she trembled and very bitterly wept; but she
<lb/>made acceptance of the vow, (for what was she but a child ?)
<lb/>and it made easy to her the bed of her death. And she said
<lb/>to me, not many days afterwards, tranquilly dying, that, be-
<lb break="no"/>cause of what I had done for the comfort of her spirit, she
<lb/>would watch over me in that spirit when departed, and, if
<lb/>so it were permitted her, return to me visibly in the watches
<lb/>of the night; but, if this thing were, indeed, beyond the
<lb/>power of the souls in Paradise, that she would, at least, give
<lb/>me frequent indications of her presence; sighing upon me
<lb/>in the evening winds, or filling the air which I breathed
<lb/>with perfume from the censers of the angels. And, with
<lb/>these words upon her lips, she yielded up her innocent life,
<lb/>putting an end to the first epoch of my own.</p><p></p><p>Thus far I have faithfully said. But as I pass the barrier
<lb/>in Time’s path formed by the death of my beloved, and pro-
<lb break="no"/>ceed with the second era of my existence, I feel that a
<lb/>shadow gathers over my brain, and I mistrust the perfect
<lb/>sanity of the record. But let me on.—Years dragged them-
<lb break="no"/>selves along heavily, and still I dwelled within the Valley
<lb/>of the Many-Colored Grass;—but a second change had come
<lb/>upon all things. The star-shaped flowers shrank into the
<lb/>stems of the trees, and appeared no more. The tints of the
<lb/>green carpet faded ; and, one by one, the ruby-red asphodels</p><p><pb n="324"/>
</p><p>withered away; and there sprang up, in place of them, ten
<lb/>by ten, dark eye-like violets that writhed uneasily and were
<lb/>ever encumbered with dew. And Life departed from our
<lb/>paths ; for the tall flamingo flaunted no longer his scarlet
<lb/>plumage before us, but flew sadly from the vale into the
<lb/>hills, with all the gay glowing birds that had arrived in his
<lb/>company. And the golden and silver fish swam down
<lb/>through the gorge at the lower end of our domain and be-
<lb break="no"/>decked the sweet river never again. And the lulling melody
<lb/>that had been softer than the wind-harp of AEolus and more
<lb/>divine than all save the voice of Eleonora, it died little by
<lb/>little away, in murmurs growing lower and lower, until the
<lb/>stream returned, at length, utterly, into the solemnity of its
<lb/>original silence. And then, lastly the voluminous cloud
<lb/>uprose, and, abandoning the tops of the mountains to the
<lb/>dimness of old, fell back into the regions of Hesper, and took
<lb/>away all its manifold golden and gorgeous glories from the
<lb/>Valley of the Many-Colored Grass.</p><p></p><p>Yet the promises of Eleonora were not forgotten; for I
<lb/>heard the sounds of the swinging of the censers of the an-
<lb break="no"/>gels ; and streams of a holy perfume floated ever and ever
<lb/>about the valley ; and at lone hours, when my heart beat
<lb/>heavily, the winds that bathed my brow came unto me laden
<lb/>with soft sighs; and indistinct murmurs filled often the night
<lb/>air ; and once—oh, but once only! I was awakened from a
<lb/>slumber like the slumber of death by the pressing of spiritual
<lb/>lips upon my own.</p><p></p><p>But the void within my heart refused, even thus, to be
<lb/>filled. I longed for the love which had before filled it to
<lb/>overflowing. At length the valley pained me through its
<lb/>memories of Eleonora, and I left it forever for the vanities
<lb/>and the turbulent triumphs of the world.</p><p>*****
</p><p>I found myself within a strange city, where all things
<lb/>might have served to blot from recollection the sweet dreams
<lb/>I had dreamed so long in the Valley of the Many-Colored
<lb/>Grass. The pomps and pageantries of a stately court, and
<lb/>the mad clangor of arms, and the radiant loveliness of wo-
<lb break="no"/>man, bewildered and intoxicated my brain. But as yet my
<lb/>soul had proved true to its vows, and the indications of the
<lb/>presence of Eleonora were still given me in the silent hours
<lb/>of the night. Suddenly, these manifestations they ceased;
<lb/>and the world grew dark before mine eyes; and I stood
<lb/>aghast at the burning thoughts which possessed—at the ter-
<lb break="no"/>rible temptations which beset me; for there came from some
<lb/>far, far distant and unknown land, into the gay court of the
<lb/>king I served, a maiden to whose beauty my whole recreant
<lb/>heart yielded at once—at whose footstool I bowed down with-
<lb break="no"/>out a struggle, in the most ardent, in the most abject wor-
<lb break="no"/>ship of love. What indeed was my passion for the young
<lb/>girl of the valley in comparison with the fervor, and the de-
<lb break="no"/>lirium, and the spirit-lifting ecstasy of adoration with which
<lb/>I poured out my whole soul in tears at the feet of the ethe-
<lb break="no"/>real Ermengarde?—Oh bright was the seraph Ermengarde !
<lb/>and in that knowledge I had room for none other.—Oh divine
<lb/>was the angel Ermengarde ! and as I looked down into the
<lb/>depths of her memorial eyes I thought only of them—and of
<lb/>her.</p><p></p><p>I wedded;—nor dreaded the curse I had invoked ; and its
<lb/>bitterness was not visited upon me. And once—but once
<lb/>again in the silence of the night, there came through my
<lb/>lattice the soft sighs which had forsaken me; and they mo-
<lb break="no"/>delled themselves into familiar and sweet voice, saying:</p><p></p><p>“Sleep in peace!—for the Spirit of Love reigneth and
<lb/>ruleth, and, in taking to thy passionate heart her who is
<lb/>Ermengarde, thou art absolved, for reasons which shall be
<lb/>made known to thee in Heaven, of thy vows unto Eleonora.”</p><p>EDGAR A. POE.
A PEEP BEHIND THE CURTAIN-
MAN IN LOVE.
“There’s no killing like that which kills the heart.”
</p><p>The sad effect which disappointment in love has upon the
<lb/>female heart, has ever been a fruitful theme with the poet
<lb/>and novelist, but we are singularly in the dark as to the man-
<lb break="no"/>ner in which the lordly sex meet a similar calamity; and
<lb/>this is the more strange since there is not a man living over
<lb/>the age of twenty-five, who could not favor us with some
<lb/>choice revelations, if he only saw fit. The Sorrows of Wer-</p><p></p><p>ter have come down to us in all their naturalness and pa-
<lb break="no"/>thos, but German nature and human nature are two different
<lb/>things, and nobody at the present day thinks of opening his
<lb/>jugular vein for anything short of a pecuniary misfortune.
<lb/>How heros of romance and fancymen demean themselves
<lb/>under sorrows of the heart is nothing to the purpose ; the
<lb/>question that concerns us is, how do veritable flesh and blood
<lb/>in the shape of lawyers, doctors, merchants, editors, feel,
<lb/>when, after making a solemn tender of their persons, they
<lb/>find they have their labor for their pains. Do they bless us
<lb/>or do they curse us? Do they seek relief in solitude or in
<lb/>smoking ? The following letter will throw some light on
<lb/>the subject, and although its details seem almost too sacred
<lb/>for the public eye, yet as the parties have all passed off the
<lb/>stage, we can see no good reason for withholding it. It was
<lb/>found among the papers of a lady lately deceased, and makes
<lb/>no pretension to elegance of style, yet we envy not the feel-
<lb break="no"/>ings of that female who can peruse it without emotion, and
<lb/>who in view of the intense suffering the softer sex are capa-
<lb break="no"/>ble of producing, is not fully convinced that it is a great char-
<lb break="no"/>ity to be a woman! Ineffably captivating and winning as we
<lb/>undoubtedly are, we should still remember that one loveliest
<lb/>attribute is mercy.</p><p>______, May 10th, 1820.
My Dear Sister :
</p><p>A sad calamity has befallen our family. Our darling brother
<lb/>has been—refused. It took place this morning. We had long
<lb/>known that he was suffering from an attack of the tender passion,
<lb/>but in consequence of severe losses at play, and our father's obdu-
<lb break="no"/>racy, who refused to advance him a single stiver, it reached its cri-
<lb break="no"/>sis, before we were prepared for it. It was a hard thing for him,
<lb/>a man and a Howard, to acknowledge to another, and that other a
<lb/>woman, that he found himself insufficient for his own happiness :—
<lb/>but when he reflected that his ancestors had all done the same thing
<lb/>before him, and that it would not be considered as derogating from
<lb/>his dignity, he resolved to smother his pride and follow in their foot-
<lb break="no"/>steps. His strongest feelings too were enlisted in the question, for
<lb/>he had ever present with him a gnawing sense of emptiness, so to
<lb/>speak, which extended to his pocket.</p><p></p><p>The most tender affection had ever subsisted between us, and on
<lb/>this occasion he sought my confidence. Ho had composed his of-
<lb break="no"/>fer, and had again and again recited it to the comer cupboard, and
<lb/>affectionately kissed the key hole : but fearing when he should ad-
<lb break="no"/>dress it to a sentient being, he might lose his self-possession and
<lb/>break down in the middle, he asked of me the favor of rehearsal.
<lb/>You will blush for my weakness, but I acknowledge the bare tho't
<lb/>of such a scene completely unnerved me,—but when I reflected
<lb/>upon the state of his finances, and that success to him was as the
<lb/>very breath of his nostrils, I conquered my emotions, and acceded
<lb/>to his solicitations. Ah ! my sister, what a sweetly interesting mo-
<lb break="no"/>ment ! and if my agitation was so great at this, how shall I ever en-
<lb break="no"/>dure the reality ?</p><p></p><p>I endeavored to enter into the spirit of the scene, and according
<lb/>to custom essayed some faint objections; but he obviated them in a
<lb/>moment, and indeed the effect was truly tremendous when he came
<lb/>down upon his knees and alluded to self-destruction.</p><p></p><p>I pronounced it perfect, but still he was not satisfied. “ There
<lb/>are other ways,” he said, that may be more effective, for “ instance,
<lb/>I am more at home on horseback, and as I have it all cut and dried,
<lb/>and on the very tip of my tongue, perhaps it might get jerked off,
<lb/>as it were, without my knowing it.” But I had insuperable ob-
<lb break="no"/>jections to this plan, for though I was aware that if refused, he
<lb/>might show his sense of injury by spurring on and leaving her, yet
<lb/>still there were advantages in being under cover not lightly to be
<lb/>relinquished. Had he been more conversant with our sex, he
<lb/>would have known there is no sight so moving to the female heart,
<lb/>as that of a real, live man prostrate before her. weeping, perspiring,
<lb/>and imploring! Yes, my sister, this is no fiction,—many a man sur-
<lb break="no"/>prised and overwhelmed by a refusal, has “ bowed his pride” and
<lb/>cried all over his broadcloth. Forgive the inelegance of my ex-
<lb break="no"/>pressions, but truth must not be sacrificed to euphony.</p><p></p><p>“ I will do so," be exclaimed with enthusiasm, “ and will this
<lb/>moment seek her residence,” and it was a beautiful sight as he flung
<lb/>himself into the saddle, and riding rather with the steed than on
<lb/>him, rose and fell gently in his seat with the regularity and preci-
<lb break="no"/>sion of the piston of a steam engine.</p><p></p><p>Occupied with pleasing thoughts of the great beauty and wealth
<lb/>of our intended sister, I was unconscious of the lapse of time, till I
<lb/>was roused by the tramp of a flying steed. Can this be the look
<lb/>of successful love, thought I, as with convulsed brow and clenched
<lb/>fists he flung himself into the apartment? Oh! what a spectacle</p><p><pb n="325"/>
</p><p>for a sister’s eye! He was red to the very roots of his hair, and
<lb/>language not the most courtly fell from his quivering lips. I ap-
<lb break="no"/>proached him—I endeavored to throw myself into his arms. He
<lb/>repulsed me. He used opprobrious epithets. “ All alike, all
<lb/>alike,” said he. I felt the cutting injustice of the expression, for
<lb/>never could I answer to my conscience to bo guilty of such cru-
<lb break="no"/>elty.</p><p></p><p>Our mother, ah! what a tie that is, sought her son. She hung
<lb/>over him and pressed into his hand a “ trifle” which she had private-
<lb break="no"/>ly subtracted from our father’s vestments. Heaven grant he may
<lb/>not miss it. The sight of his mother’s tears and the unexpected
<lb/>“tin” completely unmanned him, and the crystal sluices gave
<lb/>way.</p><p></p><p>Nor did she forget his mortal nature—a potent cordial soothed
<lb/>his exasperated feelings and he sunk into a powerful slumber. I
<lb/>have just left him: a continuous hum sounds from his chamber. It
<lb/>has been a day of intense excitement to us all, for we feared at one
<lb/>moment it would strike to his vitals. To me it seemed that he was
<lb/>severely handled, but our dear mother, who has an uncommon ac-
<lb break="no"/>quaintance with men and things, remarked that he was not more so
<lb/>than is usual with men of sensibility and true feeling, and particularly
<lb/>where the charms of the beloved one are not entirely of a personal
<lb/>nature—that their exercises are frequently of an extraordinary cha-
<lb break="no"/>racter—that love is the strongest feeling in the manly heart except
<lb/>the passion for tobacco. Oh ! what a responsibility is ours!
<lb/>When we consider that a proposal of marriage involves, not merely
<lb/>the bestowal of a name or of an immense fist, but the expenditure
<lb/>of money, absolute money; it seems to me, that nothing but a pre-
<lb break="no"/>vious engagement can justify a refusal.</p><p></p><p>But to our brother. No other connexion promised equal advan-
<lb break="no"/>tages. Old Van Bokkelen’s estate is dreadfully encumbered, and
<lb/>neighbor Vanduzzen has gone on foolishly adding to his family till
<lb/>his property is not worth dividing.</p><p></p><p>3 o’clock. Our brother is awake but complains of an internal
<lb/>sense of goneness. I have witnessed mortal anguish in many shapes
<lb/>—I have seen the loss of teeth, eye teeth, I have witnessed fearful
<lb/>contusions, but never have I beheld aught that penetrated to the
<lb/>very depths of my soul like the wailings of a re-fused man!</p><p>« Oh Love ! what is it in this world of ours,
That makes it fatal to be loved?”
Yours,	S****.
TO
I would not lord it o’er thy heart,
Alas! I cannot rule my own,
Nor would I rob one loyal thought,
From him who there should reign alone;
We both have found a life-long love
Wherein our weary souls may rest,
Yet may we not, my gentle friend
Be each to each the second best ?
A love which shall be passion-free,
Fondness as pure as it is sweet,
A bond where all the dearest ties
Of brother, friend and cousin meet,—
Such is the union I would frame,
That thus wo might he doubly blest,
With Love to rule our hearts supreme
And Friendship to be second best.	M.
</p><p>The Duke of Wellington’s Despatches.—The Albion
<lb/>is a greater admirer of “ F. M. the Duke,” so much so as to
<lb/>treasure up every scrap that falls from F. M. the Duke’s pen.
<lb/>In copying into its columns the last letter of “ F. M. the
<lb/>Duke,’’ &amp;c. to the editor of the Morning Post, the Albion
<lb/>says:</p><p></p><p>Colonel Gurwood rendered a great service to the country and to
<lb/>military history, by collecting and compiling his Grace’s public De-
<lb break="no"/>spatches ; and any other person, or persons, would confer an equal
<lb/>favor on all lovers of brevity, anti-circumlocution and coming to the
<lb/>point, if he or they would collect and lay before an admiring world,
<lb/>all the noble Duke’s short notes, terse answers, and pithy replies to a
<lb/>parcel of people who are constantly bothering themselves about him.
<lb/>We could supply a number of choice little bits ourselves to any patri-
<lb break="no"/>otic collector who may feel disposed to enter the field on this service.
<lb/>All remember the recent reply to the London reporter, who wrote to
<lb/>the Duke for permission to enter his residence, and report to the pub-
<lb break="no"/>lic the sayings and doings of the Queen and Prince Albert, who had
<lb/>gone to pay his Grace a private visit:</p><p>" The Duke of Wellington presents his compliments to Mr.—,
and does not see what Strathfieldsaye House has to do with the pub-
lic.”
</p><p>On another occasion, a person addressed himself to the Duke, send-
<lb break="no"/>ing copies of several letters and papers, all of which were enclosed in
<lb/>a case of tin. The Duke acknowledged the receipt of them as fol-
<lb break="no"/>lows :</p><p>“ The Duke of Wellington presents his compliments to Mr.—,
has received his letters and the tin case.”
</p><p>These brief despatches of his Grace, are a proof of the
<lb/>good that may be done by a little wholesome criticism. There
<lb/>was a time when the letters of “ F. M. the Duke” were not
<lb/>such perfect specimens of style, as the readers of Cobbett’s
<lb/>papers will remember. The following is one of the Duke’s
<lb/> despatches from Paris, with Cobbet’s admiring comments,
<lb/>which we fear have been omitted by Colonel Gurwood in his
<lb/>edition of the great captain’s works. It is a letter to Lord
<lb/>Castlereagh, concerning the stolen pictures in the Louvre.</p><p></p><p>Having, as far as relates to the Museums, taken a sufficient view of
<lb/>the “ greatest Statesman” of the age, I now come to that of “ the
<lb/>greatest Captain.” The writing that I am now about to notice relates
<lb/>to the same subject. The Captain was one of the Commanders at
<lb/>Paris, at the time above spoken of; and it is in that capacity that he
<lb/>writes. But, we ought to observe here, that he is not only a great
<lb/>Captain, but a great Ambassador also; that he was Ambassador at
<lb/>the Congress of Vienna just before the time we are speaking of; and
<lb/>that he was formerly Secretary of State for Ireland.</p><p></p><p>The paper, from which I am about to make a quotation, is a “ dis-
<lb break="no"/>patch” from the “greatest Captain” to Lord Castlereagh, dated at
<lb/>Paris, 23d September, 1815, soon after the Museums had been rifled.</p><p></p><p>I shall not take up much of your time with the performance of this
<lb/>gentleman; a short specimen will suffice ; and that shall consist of the
<lb/>three first paragraphs of his “ dispatch.”</p><p>"My Dear Lord,
</p><p>” There has been a good deal of discussion here lately respecting the
<lb/>measures which I have been under the necessity of adopting, in order to get
<lb/>for the King of the Netherlands his pictures &amp;c. from the Museums; and lest
<lb/>these reports should reach the Prince Regent, I wish to trouble you, for his
<lb/>Royal Highness’s information, with the following statement of what has
<lb/>passed.</p><p></p><p>“Shortly after the arrival of the Sovereigns at Paris, the Minister of
<lb/>the King ot the Netherlands claimed the Pictures, &amp;c. belonging to his Sover-
<lb break="no"/>eign, equally with those of other pouers ; and, as far as I could learn, never
<lb/>could get any satisfactory reply from the French Government. After several
<lb/>conversations with me, he addressed your Lordship an official Note, which
<lb/>was laid before the Ministers of the Allied Sovereigns, assembled in confer-
<lb break="no"/>ence ; and the subject was taken into consideration repeatedly, with a view
<lb/>to discover a mode of doing justice to the Claiments of the specimens of
<lb/>the arts in the Museums, without injuring the feelings of the King of France.
<lb/>In the mean time, the Prussians had obtained from His Majesty not only all
<lb/>the really Prussian Pictures, but these belonging to the Prussian territories
<lb/>on the left of the Rhine, and the Pictures, &amp;c., belonging to all the allies
<lb/>of His Prussian Majesty ; and the subject pressed for an early decision ; and
<lb/>your Lordship wrote your Note of the 11th inst. in which it was fully dis-
<lb break="no"/>cussed.	</p><p></p><p>“ The Ministers of the King of the Netherlands, still having no satis-
<lb break="no"/>factory answer from the French Government, appealed to me as the Gen-
<lb break="no"/>eral in Chief of the army of the King of the Netherlands, to know whether
<lb/>I had any objection to employ His Majesty’s Troops to obtain possession of
<lb/>what was his undoubted property. I referred this application again to the
<lb/>Ministers ot the Allied Courts, and no objection having been stated. I con-
<lb break="no"/>sidered it my duty to take the necessary measures to obtain what was his right.”</p><p></p><p>The great characteristic of this writing (if writing it ought to be
<lb/>called) is the thorough-paced vulgarity of it. There is a meanness of
<lb/>manner as well as of expression, and, indeed, a suitableness to the sub-
<lb break="no"/>ject, much too natural, in all its appearances, to have been the effect
<lb/>of art.</p><p></p><p>The writer, though addressing a minister of State, and writing mat-
<lb break="no"/>ter to be laid before a Sovereign, begins exactly in the manner of a
<lb/>quidnunc talking to another that he has just met in the street. “ There
<lb/>has been a good deal of “ discussion” (that is to say, talk) here;"
<lb/>that is to say, at Paris, Castlereagh being, at that time, in London.
<lb/>The phrase "to get for” is so very dignified, that it could have come
<lb/>only from a great man, and could have been inspired by nothing short
<lb/>of the consciousness of being “ the Ally of all the nations of Europe,”
<lb/>as the writer calls himself in another part of this famous “ dispatch ”</p><p></p><p>But, what are “ these reports," of which the great Captain speaks
<lb/>in the latter part of this paragraph ? He had spoken of no reports be-
<lb break="no"/>fore. He had mentioned “ discussion,” and a “ good deal” of it; but
<lb/>had said not a word about reports ; and these reports pop out upon us
<lb/>like “ these six men in buckram,” in Fulstaff’s narrative to the Prince.</p><p></p><p>The Captain’s “ wishing to trouble” Lord Castlereagh, “ for the
<lb/>Regent's information," closes this paragraph in a very suitable man-
<lb break="no"/>ner, and prepares the mind for the next, where the Regent would find
<lb/>trouble enough, if he were compelled to find out the English of it.
<lb/>The Dutch Minister “ claimed the Pictures belonging to his sovereign,
<lb/>equally with those of other powers." What! did this Dutchman claim
<lb/>the whole; those belonging to the Dutch sovereign and those belonging
<lb/>to all the other powers besides! This, to be sure, would have been in
<lb/>the true Dutch style : but, this could hardly be the fact. If it were,
<lb/>no wonder that the Duke had learned, that the Minister “ never could
<lb/>get any satisfactory reply for, it must have been a deal indeed that
<lb/>would have satisfied him.</p><p></p><p>The phrase, “ he addressed your Lordship an official Note” is in the
<lb/>counting-house style ; and then to say to Lord Castlereagh, “ your
<lb/>Lordship wrote your Note of the 11th of September,” was neces-
<lb break="no"/>sary, lest the latter should imagine that somebody else had written the</p><p><pb n="326"/>
</p><p>Note ! Nor are the four ands in this paragraph to be overlooked ; for
<lb/>never was this poor conjunction so worked before, except, perhaps,
<lb/>in some narrative of a little girl to her mother.</p><p></p><p>The narrative is, in the last quoted paragraph, continued with un-
<lb break="no"/>relaxed spirit. The Dutch Minister can still obtain no satisfactory
<lb/>answer; he asks the Duke whether he have any objection to use force,
<lb/>and asserts, at the same time, that the goods in question are his mas-
<lb break="no"/>ter's “ undoubted property.” Upon this the Duke applies to the other
<lb/>ministers, and "no objection having been stated,” he considers it his
<lb/>duty to obtain “ what was his right;” that is to say, the Dutch king’s
<lb/>right.</p><p></p><p>Never was there surely a parcel of words before put together by any
<lb/>body is so clumsy a manner. In a subsequent part of the “ dispatch,"
<lb/>we have this: “ I added, that I had no instructions regarding the
<lb/>Museum, nor no grounds on which to form a judgment.” In another
<lb/>place we have t! the King of the Netherland's Pictures.” In another
<lb/>place we have “ that the property should be returned to their rightful
<lb/>owners.”</p><p></p><p>But, to bestow criticism on such a shocking abuse of letters is to
<lb/>disgrace it; and nothing can apologize for what I have done, but the
<lb/>existence of a general knowledge of the fact, that the miserable stuff
<lb/>that I have quoted, and on which I have been remarking, proceeded
<lb/>from the pen of a man, who has, on many occasions, had some of the
<lb/>most important of the nation’s affairs committed to his management.
<lb/>There is in the nonsense of Castlereagh a frivolity and a toppery that
<lb/>give it a sort of liveliness, and that now-and-then elicit a smile : but,
<lb/>in the productions of his correspondent there is nothing to relieve ; all
<lb/>is vulgar, all clumsy, all dull, all torpid inanity.</p><p>S O N.N E T .
</p><p>Fair eyed Sincerity forbids me write
<lb/>' Dear Love,’ but smiles assenting on ‘ Dear Friend ;'
<lb/>(Since time has swept my passion into night;)</p><p>Nor dare I with this pure emotion blend
Aught sensuous, or of ideal rapture born:
For now am I in love with Cheerfulness;
And almost have forgot that mood forlorn,
Which bids the poor soul hug her own distress.
Now, evening bells ring in my evening peace,
And tranquil morn salutes me for a friend :
My wane of passion is my mind’s increase,
And every hour I rather live than spend.
Then, if you mourn, morn not for me that live
So rich in pity I can spare to give.	HORUS,

<lb/>German work of Dr. J. E. Guhrauer. By John M. Mackie. Boston:
<lb/>Gould, Kendall and Lincoln, 59 Washington street. 1845.</p><p></p><p>On the 21st of June (O. S,) 1646, Catharine, wife of Frede-
<lb break="no"/>rick Leibnitz, gave birth to a boy, who was soon to astonish
<lb/>not only his native city of Leipsic, but even the world. When
<lb/>being baptized on the third day of his existence Godfrey
<lb/>William (this was the name he received at the baptismal
<lb/>font) raised his head and opened his tiny eyes, and seemed
<lb/>consciously to receive the symbolic rite, as became a being
<lb/>who was to live always in the presence of his Maker. The
<lb/>delighted father, noting this event in his family journal, thus
<lb/>comments: “This is my desire; and so do I prophetically
<lb/>look upon this occurrence as a sign of faith, and a most sure
<lb/>token, that this my son will walk through life with eyes up-
<lb break="no"/>turned to heaven, burning with love to God, and abounding
<lb/>in wonderful works to the honor of the Most High, the in-
<lb break="no"/>crease and purification of the Christian Church, and the sal-
<lb break="no"/>vation of both his and our souls.”</p><p></p><p>The boy lived to accomplish the prophecy. Before he was
<lb/>twelve years old, he was so far advanced in his studies, that
<lb/>he could read the Latin language with ease, and had begun
<lb/>to stammer in Greek, and wrote verses with great readiness
<lb/>and felicity. This forwardness he owed entirely to innate
<lb/>genius, for his stupid teacher would have restrained his ar-
<lb break="no"/>dor, had it not been for the timely interference of a friend.
<lb/>In his Fragment of Personal Confessions, he holds the fol-
<lb break="no"/>lowing language: “Two things were of special service to</p><p></p><p>me, even from boyhood ; first, that I was strictly a self-taught
<lb/>scholar; and secondly, that in the study of every science,
<lb/>even at the outset, and before I had made myself thoroughly
<lb/>acquainted with what was commonly known and received in
<lb/>it, I thought to make original discoveries. By this course,
<lb/>I secured the advantage of not encumbering my mind with
<lb/>things of no value, which depended on authority rather than
<lb/>intrinsic merit ; aad also, that of never being satisfied until
<lb/>I had laid bare the roots and fibres of every science, and had
<lb/>discovered its fundamental principles, upon which all sub-
<lb break="no"/>ordinate views and minor details naturally depend.” This is
<lb/>the road that all great minds must take and which can alone
<lb/>lead to great results; but this is precisely the one which is
<lb/>most commonly disapproved of by “ dull respectabilities,”
<lb/>to whom the authority of age is a guaranty of accurate
<lb/>knowledge, and who like their ease too well to allow their
<lb/>equanimity to be be disturbed by those who would attempt
<lb/>to leach them something new.</p><p></p><p>Before he had attained the age of twenty, Leibnitz pub-
<lb break="no"/>lished a treatise De Arte Comhinatorio, upon which he look-
<lb break="no"/>ed in his after years as a depository of the germs of his sub-
<lb break="no"/>sequent manifold philosophical views and discoveries. In
<lb/>his 21st year, this precocious youth received the degree of a
<lb/>Doctor at the University of Altdorf with great applause, af-
<lb break="no"/>ter being refused the honor, through intrigues, in his native
<lb/>city. In conequencc of the brilliant display of his extraor-
<lb break="no"/>dinary abilities at the examination for the doctorate, he had
<lb/>a professorship offered to him, which he declined, as it would
<lb/>have interfered with his contemplated plan of reform in
<lb/>science.</p><p></p><p>Stimulated by the desire of knowledge, on his taking up
<lb/>his residence at Nuremberg, Leibnitz wished to become ini-
<lb break="no"/>tiated in the mysteries of the secret society of Rosicrucians,
<lb/>who believed themselves so well versed in chemistry, that
<lb/>they hoped the day was not far distant when their labors
<lb/>would be crowned by the discovery of the long-sought philo-
<lb break="no"/>sopher’s stone. His age and want of influential friends were
<lb/>in the way of his accomplishing this object; not dishearten-
<lb break="no"/>ed, however, he fell upon a stratagem which succeeded be-
<lb break="no"/>yond his expectations. He wrote a letter to one of the direc-
<lb break="no"/>tors of the society, a reverend clergyman, full of the obscurest
<lb/>terms and phrases, which he gathered from various books on
<lb/>chemistry, respectfully suing for admission into the learned
<lb/>fraternity. The artifice succeeded ; not only was the mys-
<lb break="no"/>terious circle opened, but the situation of secretary with a
<lb/>small salary was offered to him, which he gladly accepted.
<lb/>In this singular office he remained only through the winter
<lb/>of 1666; long enough to learn the follies of the gold-seeking
<lb/>fraternity.</p><p></p><p>The accidental acquaintance with the distinguished states-
<lb break="no"/>man John Christian Baron von Boineburg, which soon ripen-
<lb break="no"/>ed into friendship, was a turning point in Leibnitz’s career;
<lb/>it gave him an opportunity to mingle with princes and dis-
<lb break="no"/>tinguished literary men. His sphere of action was soon
<lb/>sufficiently enlarged to gratify his highest ambition; now
<lb/>we find him busy in politics, law or philosophy,—now in
<lb/>theology or scientific discovery ; thus active, he rapidly
<lb/>earned an European reputation. In what esteem his saga-
<lb break="no"/>cious friend the Baron held him, we learn from a letter in-
<lb break="no"/>troducing him to the acquaintance of the distinguished states-
<lb break="no"/>man Hermann Conring. “ He is a young man from Leipsic,
<lb/>of four-and-twenty, doctor of laws, and learned beyond all
<lb/>credence. Being acquainted with the whole course of phi-
<lb break="no"/>losophy, he is a good mediator between the old and new
<lb/>systems; he is a mathematician, also understanding physics,
<lb/>medicine, and the whole range of mechanics; and is, withal,
<lb/>ardent and industrious. In religion he is an independent</p><p><pb n="327"/>
</p><p>thinker; and for the rest, belongs to your (the Lutheran)
<lb/>church. The theory, and what is to be wondered at, the
<lb/>practice also, of law, is perfectly familiar to him. He is de-
<lb break="no"/>voted to you with love and veneration.” The Baron’s gene-
<lb break="no"/>rous and correct opinion of the young man, proved him to be
<lb/>an equally uncommon individual—“ Genius too seldom has
<lb/>the privilege of being tried by its peers.”</p><p></p><p>Leibnitz continued to deserve this high opinion by his un-
<lb break="no"/>tiring activity and brilliant discoveries. Some men arrive
<lb/>at the climax of their greatness long before the evening of
<lb/>their life sets in, and then only contemplate the trophies of
<lb/>their early days. But it was not so with Leibnitz; he may
<lb/>be said to have lived each day on new glories.</p><p></p><p>We cannot think of the discovery of the differential calcu-
<lb break="no"/>lus without regretting that it should have been the cause of
<lb/>so much bitter feeling between such illustrious rivals as
<lb/>Leibnitz and Newton, who, unknown to each other, about
<lb/>the same time wrought out of their meditations such a
<lb/>treasure for science ; and we regret the more, for Sir Isaac
<lb/>showed the want of that ingenuousness which elevates his
<lb/>rival so much above him. Although the Royal Society in
<lb/>London decided upon the claims of priority in favor of their
<lb/>countryman, such competent judges as Euler, Lagrange,
<lb/>La Place, and Poisson have reversed the verdict, and at last
<lb/>justice has been done to the long neglected name of Leib-
<lb break="no"/>nitz, whom national partiality would have deprived of his
<lb/>due meed of praise.</p><p></p><p>To show how much philosophy is indebted to Leibnitz,
<lb/>we should have to give an account of its condition previous
<lb/>to his lime and since. Although his philosophy is scattered
<lb/>through different essays, prompted by variety of causes, and
<lb/>always bearing some relation to time and circumstances, it is
<lb/>sufficiently complete and original; and as his biographer at-
<lb break="no"/>tests, much of its wisdom passed into his living.</p><p></p><p>That he brought a capacious mind and a right spirit to the
<lb/>investigation of truth, is evident from what he says in a let-
<lb break="no"/>ter to De Montserat—“ I have found that the greater number
<lb/>of sects are right in much which they affirm, but not in
<lb/>what they deny. The Formalists, like the Platonists and the
<lb/>Aristotelians, are in the right when they recognise the foun-
<lb break="no"/>tain of things in the final and formal causes; but they are in
<lb/>the wrong, when they neglect the efficient and material
<lb/>causes, and, like Henry More in England, and certain Plato-
<lb break="no"/>nists, conclude that there are appearances which cannot be
<lb/>accounted for mechanically. On the other side, the materi-
<lb break="no"/>alists, or those who occupy themselves exclusively with me-
<lb break="no"/>chanical philosophy, are in error in discarding metaphysics
<lb/>and attempting to explain everything directly or indirectly,
<lb/>through the imagination. I flatter myself that I have pene-
<lb break="no"/>trated into the harmony of the different kingdoms ; and have
<lb/>seen that both parties are right, if they only would not ex-
<lb break="no"/>clude each other.” 'Would that man should always bring
<lb/>such spirit to all investigation ; our common stock of know-
<lb break="no"/>ledge, besides being purified, would receive large additions.
<lb/>There would be then but little chance for sects or fanatics,
<lb/>either in science or philosophy. All error presupposes some
<lb/>truth, and its success is only proportionate to the truth it
<lb/>may involve; for pure falsehood can never exist.</p><p></p><p>After repeated unsuccessful attempts at a reconciliation of
<lb/>the Romish church with the Protestant, Leibnitz abandoned
<lb/>his darling idea for a union of all the Protestant churches in
<lb/>Europe against the church of Rome. But as the only fruit
<lb/>of these noble efforts, he secured himself a place in the ranks
<lb/>of the first Protestant theologians. That age was not far
<lb/>enough advanced to comprehend his Christian spirit; and
<lb/>even our own is not yet ripe for such a union of Christians:
<lb/>as long as ignorance and vice wear the mask of sanctity, and
<lb/>faith in sectarian dogmas supplies the place of love to man
<lb/>manifest in good deeds, we shall look in vain for that bless-
<lb break="no"/>ed event.</p><p></p><p>Of all that Leibnitz has written, the Theodicea has, per-
<lb break="no"/>haps, made him most widely known. In it his philosophy is
<lb/>reduced to practical life, and made intelligible to all minds,
<lb/>and by the very quality which makes it an incomplete work
<lb/>as a systematic exposition of philosophy, it has been made
<lb/>more serviceable to the spread of sound views of life. It is
<lb/>a pity that while this work is known to other nations, and
<lb/>highly valued by them, it is not, to our knowledge, transla-
<lb break="no"/>ted into English.</p><p>His intellectual activity finds no parallel in history; he
</p><p>knew all that was of importance to others to know, and be-
<lb break="no"/>sides he excogitated many new things, that the world was
<lb/>some time or other to learn from him, and some of which it
<lb/>has not learnt yet. He was always laboring to extend his
<lb/>own information and that of others, and spared no efforts to
<lb/>acquaint himself with discoveries in science or art. And all
<lb/>this he did for the sake of knowledge, as well as for the good
<lb/>of the race ; for we are willing to take kis own testimony.
<lb/>In a letter to Magliabechi, thus he says: „For I can suggest
<lb/>much to others, but cannot alone execute all that occurs to
<lb/>me ; and I would gladly give to others the fame of many of
<lb/>my inventions, if only the public welfare, the good of the
<lb/>race, and the glory of God might thereby be promoted.” And
<lb/>in another instance, alluding to the publication of his disco-
<lb break="no"/>very of the differential calculus, he gives utterance to the fol-
<lb break="no"/>lowing generous sentiment: “But it gives me pleasure to
<lb/>see the fruits of seeds scattered by my own hand growing in
<lb/>the gardens of others.” His unlimited good will towards
<lb/>man manifested itself in his activity for the welfare of the
<lb/>own nation as well as of others: now we see him serve the
<lb/>Imperial Elector of Hanover—now zealously engaged in lay-
<lb break="no"/>ing the foundation of the Academy of Sciences at Berlin—or
<lb/>projecting one at Dresden; then advising Peter the Great
<lb/>upon the best means of civilizing his Russians ; and now
<lb/>holding counsel with Charles VI. in Vienna.</p><p></p><p>We have a corroboration of his noble character from the
<lb/>pen of his secretary and friend Eckhart, who says “He spoke
<lb/>well of every one—put the best construction upon the actions
<lb/>of others, and ever spared his enemies, when having it in his
<lb/>power to dispossess them of their places.”</p><p></p><p>To our apprehension, the crowning eminence in Leibnitz’s
<lb/>character is his capacity for friendship. A person that is
<lb/>capable of generous and devoted friendship, is incapable of
<lb/>much wrong; for that pure flame either purifies the dross of
<lb/>the human heart, or it is extinguished; we speak of friend-
<lb break="no"/>ship that is unchangeable, ready for all sacrifice, and knows
<lb/>no sex—a friendship that is very rare, and of which great
<lb/>souls alone are capable. The capacity for such a friendship
<lb/>is the test of true greatness.</p><p></p><p>Such a friendship existed between Sophia Charlotte, queen
<lb/>of Prussia, and Leibnitz, who, on her demise, writing to their
<lb/>mutual friend, Miss Von Pollnitz, gives vent to his grief in
<lb/>the following strain: “ I infer your feelings from my own.
<lb/>I weep not: I complain not; but I know not where to look
<lb/>for relief. The loss of the queen appears to me like a dream ;
<lb/>but when I awake from my reverie, I find it but too true.—
<lb/>Your misfortune is not greater than mine, only your feelings
<lb/>are more lively, and you stood in the midst of the general
<lb/>calamity. This encourages me to write to you and beg that
<lb/>you will moderate your sorrow, if possible, lest you do your-
<lb break="no"/>self an injury. It is not by excessive grief we shall best honor
<lb/>the memory of one of the most perfect princesses of the earth,
<lb/>but rather by our admiration of her virtues; and the reason-
<lb break="no"/>able world will be on our side. My letter is more philoso-
<lb break="no"/>phical than my heart, and I am unable to follow my own
<lb/>counsel; but it is, notwithstanding, rational.” This affliction
<lb/>deranged his usual course of life for some time, and he him-
<lb break="no"/>self narrowly escaped an attack of severe illness.</p><p></p><p>Great as Leibnitz was, yet his influence, while active, was
<lb/>diminished by the fact of his being unmarried. A single
<lb/>man is never identified so much with society as to exert all
<lb/>his powers for its benefit. A great man, when he lives sin-
<lb break="no"/>gle, may be said to bury a good half of himself under the
<lb/>ground, for no better purpose than that, when grown old, he
<lb/>may enjoy his own reproaches for his folly. Yet these are
<lb/>the very men who can seldom find a counterpart of them-
<lb break="no"/>selves in woman ; their union in the marriage bond is unfre-
<lb break="no"/>quently but a separation in spirit. They seem to be destined,
<lb/>socially and intellectually, to live solitary, like the eagle on
<lb/>its rocky peak, occupied with their brood of thoughts, and
<lb/>surveying with aching eyes the wide universe spread before
<lb/>I them, the greatest bliss of which—communion, they are not
<lb/>allowed to taste. That Leibnitz was aware of the advanta-
<lb break="no"/>ges and disadvantages of marriage, we learn from his say-
<lb break="no"/>ing, “ Marriage is a good thing—only a wise man must
<lb/>spend his whole life in meditating it.” Although alive to the
<lb/>kindly sympathies of the softer sex, he lived alone ; and the
<lb/>world lost the benefit of that part of his character which is
<lb/>only developed in wedlock.</p><p></p><p>Absorbed in higher themes, he suppressed those emotions
<lb/>which pervade the mass of men, and by which only it is
<lb/>possible for another human being to gain a permanent hold</p><p><pb n="328"/>
</p><p>upon mankind. His only passion was to seek after know-
<lb break="no"/>ledge, that it may benefit the race ; his writings are so pure-
<lb break="no"/>ly intellectual, so free from the fire of common passions that,
<lb/>while he deserves to be ranked among the greatest genius-
<lb break="no"/>es, and greatest benefactors that ever lived, he has not had
<lb/>even the half of the meed of praise which was bestowed by
<lb/>the thoughtless multitude upon men of smaller stature.</p><p></p><p>Leibnitz was a poet of the highest order; of course, we do
<lb/>not take the word in its vulgar and limited meaning ; he was
<lb/>the highest type of genius : he had the key to Nature’s mys-
<lb break="no"/>teries, which lie expounded to the less favored sons of Eve.
<lb/>He was permitted, priestlike, to comprehend the counsels
<lb/>of God, that he might reveal to his fellow mortals the wis-
<lb break="no"/>dom and benevolence of our heavenly Father. To us, he is
<lb/>an intellectual Howard, visiting the dens of ignorance to re-
<lb break="no"/>scue truth from the mire of error. In his time there was
<lb/>none equal to him, not even Newton ; and since, none has
<lb/>appeared that can measure himself with the German sage.</p><p></p><p>Mankind owes gratitude to its great men, as they are its
<lb/>teachers and fashioners, its ornaments and redeemers; and
<lb/>every nation should do its part in acknowledging itself their
<lb/>debtor—willing to pay the interest, although unable to dis-
<lb break="no"/>charge the full liability. And we are glad that at last there
<lb/>was found one, who took upon himself the honorable respon-
<lb break="no"/>sibility of acknowledging this indebtedness on the part of the
<lb/>Anglo-Saxon race to the genius of Leibnitz, by presenting
<lb/>the English reader with the life of the sage. The writer has
<lb/>our thanks, for he has admirably acquitted himsolf of the
<lb/>task: the interest and unity of his theme are well supported
<lb/>by a chaste diction.</p><p></p><p>But while we thank him for what he has done, we beg
<lb/>leave to dissent from his conclusion; we should have been
<lb/>much better pleased had he preserved those German pecu-
<lb break="no"/>liarities, which he thought not adapted to the wants of the
<lb/>Appalachian literary public.</p><p></p><p>There are two views to be taken of the life of a man ;—
<lb/>first, as he makes one identity standing out in distinct linea-
<lb break="no"/>ments of society—next, as that identity sends out its roots
<lb/>into society in different directions, both to prop itself and
<lb/>strengthen the social frame work. The writer has taken
<lb/>chiefly the first view of the life of Leibnitz. To us it would
<lb/>have been more satisfactory, had it been conformable to our
<lb/>way of viewing these matters. Biography is a key to histo-
<lb break="no"/>ry, and only such biographies as represent this two-fold
<lb/>view of an individual, can be good keys to unlock the
<lb/>true spirit of history that time holds in its fastnesses—the
<lb/>past and the distant.</p><p></p><p>We have another reason to thank the writer for his work.
<lb/>Every thing that makes us better acquainted with the great
<lb/>and good men of other countries, is calculated either to
<lb/>strengthen national sympathies, or remove prejudices that
<lb/>ignorance or national vanity begets. The work in hand will
<lb/>contribute its share to this desirable result; inasmuch as
<lb/>there is room in the Anglo-Saxon race for the happy influ-
<lb break="no"/>ence of those kindly feelings which lead us, on all occasions,
<lb/>to view the man of another clime as a brother, and deserving
<lb/>at our hands that regard to which humanity, civilization,
<lb/>and Christianity give him a title.</p><p>Poems. By William W. Lord. New York: D. Apppleton &amp; Co.
</p><p>Of Mr. Lord we know nothing—although we believe that
<lb/>he is a student at Princeton College—or perhaps a graduate,
<lb/>or perhaps a Professor of that Institution. Of his book,
<lb/>lately, we have heard a good deal—that is to say, we have
<lb/>heard it announced in every possible variation of phrase, as
<lb/>“ forthcoming.” For several months past, indeed, much
<lb/>amusement has been occasioned in the various literary cote-
<lb break="no"/>ries in New York, by the pertinacity and obviousness of an
<lb/>attempt made by the poet’s friends to get up an anticipatory
<lb/>excitement in his favor. There were multitudinous dark
<lb/>rumors of something in posse—whispered insinuations that
<lb/>the sun had at length arisen or would certainly arise—that
<lb/>a book was really in press which would revolutionize the
<lb/>poetical world—that the MS. had been submitted to the in-
<lb break="no"/>spection of a junto of critics, whose fiat was well understood
<lb/>to be Fate, (Mr. Charles King, if we remember aright, form-
<lb break="no"/>ng one of the junto)—that the work had by them been ap-</p><p></p><p>proved, and its successful reception and illimitable glorifica-
<lb break="no"/>tion assured.—Mr. Longfellow, in consequence, countermand-
<lb break="no"/>ing an order given his publishers (Redding &amp; Co.,) to issue
<lb/>forthwith a new threepenny edition of “The Voices of the
<lb/>Night.” Suggestions of this nature, busily circulated in pri-
<lb break="no"/>vate, were, in good time, insinuated through the press, until
<lb/>at length the public expectation was as much on tiptoe as
<lb/>public expectation, in America, can ever be expected to be
<lb/>about so small a matter as the issue of a volume of Ameri-
<lb break="no"/>can poems. The climax of this whole effort, however, at
<lb/>forestalling the critical opinion, and by far the most injudi-
<lb break="no"/>cious portion of the procedure, was the publisher’s announce-
<lb break="no"/>ment of the forthcoming book as “a very remarkable volume
<lb/>of poems.”</p><p></p><p>The fact is, the only remarkable things about Mr. Lord’s
<lb/>compositions, are their remarkable conceit, ignorance, impu-
<lb break="no"/>dence, platitude, stupidity and bombast:—we are sorry to
<lb/>say all this, but there is an old adage about the falling of the
<lb/>Heavens. Nor must we be misunderstood. We intend to
<lb/>wrong neither Mr. Lord nor our own conscience, by denying
<lb/>him particular merits—such as they are. His book is not
<lb/>altogether contemptible—although the conduct of his friends
<lb/>has innoculated nine-tenths of the community with the opin-
<lb break="no"/>ion that it is—but what we wish to say, is that “ remarka-
<lb break="no"/>ble” is by no means the epithet to be applied, in the way of
<lb/>commendation, either to anything that he has yet done or to
<lb/>anything that he may hereafter accomplish. In a word,
<lb/>while he has undoubtedly given proof of a very ordinary spe-
<lb break="no"/>cies of talent, no man whose opinion is entitled to the slight-
<lb break="no"/>est respect will admit in him any indication of genius.</p><p></p><p>The " particular merits” to which, in the case of Mr. Lord,
<lb/>we have allusion, are merely the accidental merits of par-
<lb break="no"/>ticular passages. We say accidental—because poetical merit
<lb/>which is not simply an accident, is very sure to be found,
<lb/>more or less, in a state of diffusion throughout a poem. No
<lb/>man is entitled to the sacred name of poet, because from 160
<lb/>pages of doggrel, may be culled a few sentences of worth.
<lb/>Nor would the case be in any respect altered, if these few
<lb/>sentences, or even if a few passages of length, were of an
<lb/>excellence even supreme. For a poet is necessarily a man
<lb/>of genius, and with the spirit of true genius even its veriest
<lb/>common-places are intertwined and inextricably intertangled.
<lb/>When, therefore, amid a Sahara of platitude, we discover an
<lb/>occasional Oasis, we must not so far forget ourselves as to
<lb/>fancy any latent fertility in the sands. It is our purpose,
<lb/>however, to do the fullest justice to Mr. Lord, and we pro-
<lb break="no"/>ceed at once to cull from his book whatever, in our opinion,
<lb/>will put in the fairest light his poetical pretensions.</p><p></p><p>And first we extract the one brief passage which aroused
<lb/>in us what we recgnised as the Poetical Sentiment. It oc-
<lb break="no"/>curs, at page 94, in “ Saint Mary’s Gift,” which, although ex-
<lb break="no"/>cessively unoriginal at all points, is upon the whole, the least
<lb/>reprehensible poem of the volume. The heroine of the story
<lb/>having taken a sleeping draught, after the manner of Juliet,
<lb/>is conveyed to a vault (still in the same manner) and (still
<lb/>in the same manner) awakes in the presence of her lover
<lb/>who comes to gaze on what he supposes her corpse :</p><p>And each unto the other was a dream ;
And so they gazed without a stir or breath,
Until her head into the golden stream
Of her wide tresses, loosened from their wreath,
Sank back, as she did yield again to death.
</p><p>At page 3, in a composition of much general eloquence,
<lb/>there occur a few lines of which we should not hesitate to
<lb/>speak enthusiastically were we not perfectly well aware
<lb/>that Mr. Lord has no claim to their origination:</p><p>------ Ye winds
That in the impalpable deep caves of air,
<pb n="329"/>
Moving your silent plumes, in dreams of flight,
Tumultuous lie, and from your half-stretched wings
Beat the faint zephyrs that disturb the air !
At page 6, in the same poem, we meet, also, a passage of
high merit, although sadly disfigured:
Thee the bright host of Heaven,
</p><p>The stars adore :—a thousand altars, fed
<lb/>By pure unwearied hands, like cressets blaze
<lb/>In the blue depths of night; nor all unseen
<lb/>In the pale sky of day, with tempered light
<lb/>Burn radiant of thy praise.</p><p></p><p>The disfiguration to which we allude, lies in the making
<lb/>a blazing altar burn merely like a blazing cresset—a simile
<lb/>about as forcible as would be the likening an apple to a pear,
<lb/>or the sea-foam to the froth on a pitcher of Burton’s ale.</p><p></p><p>At page 7, still in the same poem, we find some verses
<lb/>which are very quotable, and will serve to make our
<lb/>readers understand what we mean by the eloquence of the
<lb/>piece:</p><p>Great Worshipper ! hast thou no thought of Him
Who gave the Sun his brightness, winged the winds,
And on the everlasting deep bestowed
Its voiceless thunder—spread its fields of blue,
And made them glorious like an inner sky
From which the islands rise like steadfast clouds,
How beautiful! who gemmed thy zone with stars,
Around thee threw his own cerulean robe,—
And bent his coronal about thy brows,
Shaped of the seven splendors of the light—
Piled up the mountains for thy throne ; and thee
The image of His beauty made and power,
And gave thee to be sharer of His state,
His majesty, His glory, and His fear !
</p><p>We extract this not because we like it ourselves, but be-
<lb break="no"/>cause we take it for granted that there are many who will,
<lb/>and that Mr. Lord himself would desire us to extract it as a
<lb/>specimen of his power. The “Great worshipper” is Nature.
<lb/>We disapprove, however, the man-milliner method in which
<lb/>she is tricked out, item by item. The “How beautiful!”
<lb/>should be understood, we fancy, as an expression of admira-
<lb break="no"/>tion on the part of Mr. Lord, for the fine idea which imme-
<lb break="no"/>diately precedes—the idea which we have italicized. It is,
<lb/>in fact, by no means destitute of force—but we have met it
<lb/>before.</p><p></p><p>At page 70, there are two stanzas addressed to “ My Sis-
<lb break="no"/>ter.” The first of these we cite as the best thing of equal
<lb/>length to be found in the book. Its conclusion is particular-
<lb break="no"/>ly noble.</p><p></p><p>And shall we meet in heaven, and know and love ?
<lb/>Do human feelings in that world above
<lb/>Unchanged survive? blest thought! but ah, I fear
<lb/>That thou, dear sister, in some other sphere,</p><p>Distant from mine will (wilt) find a brighter home,
Where I, unworthy found, may never come:—
Or be so high above me glorified,
That I a meaner angel, undescried,
Seeking thine eyes, such love alone shall see
As angels give to all bestowed on me;
And when my voice upon thy ear shall fall,
Hear only such reply as angels give to all.
</p><p>We give the lines as they are: their grammatical con-
<lb break="no"/>struction is faulty ; and the punctuation of the ninth line ren-
<lb break="no"/>ders the sense equivocal.</p><p></p><p>Of that species of composition which comes most appro-
<lb break="no"/>priately under the head, Drivel, we should have no trouble
<lb/>in selecting as many specimens as our readers could desire.
<lb/>We will afflict them with one or two:</p><p>SONG.
O soft is the ringdove’s eye of love
When her mate returns from a weary flight;
And brightest of all the stars above
Is the one bright star that leads the night.
But softer thine eye than the dove’s by far,
When of friendship and pity thou speakest to me;
And brighter, O brighter, than eye's one star
When of love, sweet maid, I speak to thee.
Here is another
SONG.
Oh, a heart it loves, it loves thee,
That never loved before
Oh, a heart it loves, it loves thee,
That heart can love no more.
As the rose was in the bud, love,
Ere it opened into sight,
As yon star in drumlie daylight
Behind the blue was bright—
So thine image in my heart, love,
As pure, as bright, as fair,
Thyself unseen, unheeded,
I saw and loved it there.
Oh, a heart it loves, it loves thee
As heart ne’er loved before;
Oh, a heart, it loves, loves, loves thee,
That heart can love no more.
In “ The Widow’s Complaint’’ we are entertained after
this fashion:
And what are these children
I once thought my own.
What now do they seem
But his orphans alone ?
In “ The New Castalia” we have it thus:
</p><p>Then a pallid beauteous maiden
<lb/>Golden ghastly robes arrayed in
<lb/>Such a wondrous strain displayed in,</p><p>In a wondrous song of Aidenne,
That all the gods and goddesses
Shook their golden yellow tresses,
Parnassus’ self made half afraid in.
Just above this there is something about aged beldames
dreaming
_____of white throats sweetly jagged
With a ragged butch-knife dull,
And of night-mares neighing, weighing,
On a sleeper’s bosom squatting.
But in mercy to our readers we forbear.
</p><p>Mr. Lord is never elevated above the dead level of his ha-
<lb break="no"/>bitual platitude, by even the happiest thesis in the world.
<lb/>That any man could, at one and the same time, fancy him-
<lb break="no"/>self a poet and siring together as many pitiable inanities as
<lb/>we see here, on so truly suggestive a thesis as that of “ A
<lb/>Lady taking the Veil,” is to our apprehension a miracle of
<lb/>miracles. The idea would seem to be, of itself, sufficient to
<lb/>elicit fire from ice—to breathe animation into the most stolid
<lb/>of stone. Mr. Lord winds up a dissertation on the subject by
<lb/>the patronizing advice—</p><p>Ere thou, irrevocable, to that dark creed
Art yielded, think, Oh Lady, think again!
the whole of which would read better if it were
Ere thou, irrevocable, to this d—d doggrel
Art yielded, Lord, think! think!—ah think again.
</p><p>Even with the great theme, Niagara, our poet fails in his
<lb/>obvious effort to work himself into a fit of inspiration. One
<lb/>of his poems has for title “ A Hymn to Niagara”—but from
<lb/>beginning to end it is nothing more than a very silly
<lb/>“ Hymn to Mr. Lord.” Instead of describing the fall (as
<lb/>well as any Mr. Lord could be supposed to describe it) he
<lb/>rants about what I feel here, and about what I did not feel
<lb/>there—till at last the figure of little Mr. Lord, in the shape
<lb/>of a great capital I gets so thoroughly in between the reader
<lb/>and the waterfall that not a particle of the latter is to be
<lb/>discovered. At one point the poet directs his soul to issue a
<lb/>proclamation as follows:</p><p>Proclaim, my soul, proclaim it to the sky !
And tell the stars, and tell the hills whose feet
Are in the depths of earth, their peaks in heaven,
And tell the Ocean’s old familiar face
Beheld by day and night, in calm and storm.
That they, nor aught beside in earth or heaven,
<pb n="330"/>
Like thee, tremendous torrent, have so filled
Its thought of beauty, and so awed with might!
</p><p>The “Its ” has reference to the soul of Mr. Lord, who
<lb/>thinks it necessary to issue a proclamation to the stars and
<lb/>the hills and the ocean’s old familiar face—lest the stars and
<lb/>the hills and the ocean’s old familiar face should chance to
<lb/>be unaware of the fact that it (the soul of Mr. Lord) admit-
<lb break="no"/>ted the waterfall to be a fine thing—but whether the catar-
<lb break="no"/>act for the compliment, or the stars for the information, are
<lb/>to be considered the party chiefly obliged—that, for the life
<lb/>of us, we cannot tell.	</p><p>From the “ first impression” of the cataract, he says:
At length my soul awaked—waked not again
To be o’erpressed, o’ermastered, and engulphed,
But of itself possessed, o’er all without
Felt conscious mastery!
And then
</p><p>Retired within, and self-withdrawn, I stood
<lb/>The two-fold centre and informing soul
<lb/>Of one vast harmony of sights and sounds,</p><p>And from that deep abyss, that rock-built shrine,
</p><p>Though mute my own frail voice, I poured a hymn
<lb/>Of “ praise and gratulation” like the noise
<lb/>Of banded angels when they shout to wake
<lb/>Empyreal echoes!</p><p></p><p>That so vast a personage as Mr. Lord should not be o’er-
<lb break="no"/>mastered by the cataract, but feel “conscious mastery over
<lb/>all without”—and over all within, too—is certainly nothing
<lb/>more than reasonable and proper—but then he should have
<lb/>left the detail of these little facts to the cataract or to some
<lb/>other uninterested individual—even Cicero has been held to
<lb/>blame for a want of modesty—and although, to be sure,
<lb/>Cicero was not Mr. Lord, still Mr. Lord may be in danger of
<lb/>blame. He may have enemies (very little men !) who will
<lb/>pretend to deny that the “hymn of praise and gratulation”
<lb/>(if this is the hymn) bears at all points more than a partial
<lb/>resemblance to the “ noise of banded angels when they shout
<lb/>to wake empyreal echoes.” Not that we intend to deny it—
<lb/>but they will:—they are very little people and they will.</p><p></p><p>We have said that the “ remarkable” feature, or at least
<lb/>one of the “ remarkable” features of this volume is its pla-
<lb break="no"/>titude—its flatness. Whenever the reader meets anything
<lb/>not decidedly flat, he may take it for granted at once, that it
<lb/>is stolen. When the poet speaks, for example, at page 148,
<lb/>of</p><p></p><p>Flowers, of young poets the first words—
<lb/>who can fail to remember the line in the Merry Wives of
<lb/>Windsor.</p><p>Fairies use flowers for their charactery ?
At page 10 he says :
Great oaks their heavenward lifted arms stretch forth
In suppliance !
</p><p>The same thought will be found in “ Pelham,” where the
<lb/>author is describing the dead tree beneath which is commit-
<lb break="no"/>ted the murder. The grossest plagiarisms, indeed, abound.
<lb/>We would have no trouble, even, in pointing out a score from
<lb/>our most unimportant self. At page 27 Mr. Lord says:
<lb/>They, albeit with inward pain</p><p>Who thought to sing thy dirge, must sing thy Paean!
In a poem called “ Lenore,” we have it
Avaunt! to-night my heart is light—no dirge will I upraise,
But waft the angel on her flight with a Paean of old days.
</p><p>At page 13, Mr. Lord says of certain flowers that
<lb/>Ere beheld on Earth they gardened Heaven !
<lb/>We print it as printed—note of admiration and all. In a
<lb/>poem called “ Al Aaraaf” we have it thus:</p><p>---------A gemmy flower,
</p><p>Inmate of highest stars, where erst it shamed
<lb/>All other loveliness:—’twas dropped from Heaven
<lb/>And fell on gardens of the unforgiven
<lb/>In Trebizond.</p><p>At page 57 Mr. Lord says:
On the old and haunted mountain,
There in dreams I dared to climb,
</p><p>Where the clear Castalian fountain
<lb/>(Silver fountain) ever tinkling
<lb/>All the green around it sprinkling
<lb/>Makes perpetual rhyme—</p><p>To my dream enchanted, golden,
Came a vision of the olden
Long-forgotten time.
There are no doubt many of our friends who will remem-
ber the commencement of our “ Haunted Palace.”
In the greenest of our valleys
By good angels tenanted,
Once a fair and stately palace
(Radiant palace) reared its head.
In the monarch Thought’s dominion
It stood there.
Never seraph spread a pinion
Over fabric half so fair.
Banners yellow, glorious, golden,
On its roof did float and flow—
This—all this—was in the olden
Time, long ago.
At page 60, Mr. Lord says:
And the aged beldames napping,
Dreamed of gently rapping, rapping,
With a hammer gently tapping,
Tapping on an infant’s skull.
In “ The Raven” we have it:
While I pondered nearly napping,
Suddenly there came a rapping,
As of some one gently tapping,
Tapping at my chamber door.
</p><p>But it is folly to pursue these thefts. As to any property
<lb/>of our own, Mr. Lord is very cordially welcome to whatever
<lb/>use he can make of it. But others may not be so pacifically
<lb/>disposed, and the book before us might be very materially
<lb/>thinned and reduced in cost, by discarding from it all that be-
<lb break="no"/>longs to Miss Barrett, Tennyson, Keats, Shelley, Proctor
<lb/>Longfellow and Lowell—the very class of poets, by the way,
<lb/>whom Mr. William W. Lord, in his “New Castalia” the
<lb/>most especially effects to satirize and to contemn.</p><p></p><p>It has been rumored, we say, or rather it has been an-
<lb break="no"/>nounced that Mr. Lord is a graduate or perhaps a Professor
<lb/>of Princeton College—but we have had much difficulty in be-
<lb break="no"/>lieving anything of the kind. The pages before us are not
<lb/>only utterly devoid of that classicism of tone and manner—th-t
<lb/>better species of classicism which a liberal education never
<lb/>fails to impart—but they abound in the most outrageously
<lb/>vulgar violations of grammar—of prosody in its most ex-
<lb break="no"/>tended sense.</p><p></p><p>Of versification, and all that appertains to it, Mr. Lord is
<lb/>ignorant in the extreme. We doubt if he can tell the differ-
<lb break="no"/>ence between a dactyl and an anapoest. In the Heroic
<lb/>(Jambic) Pentameter he is continually introducing such
<lb/>verses as these:</p><p>A faint symphony to Heaven ascending—
No heart of love, O God, Infinite One—
Of a thought as weak an aspiration—
Who were the original priests of this—
Of grace, magnificence and power—
</p><p>O’erwhelm me ; this darkness that shuts out the sky—
<lb/>Alexandrines, in the same metre, are encountered at every
<lb/>step—but it is very clear from the points at which they are
<lb/>met, and at which the coesura is placed, that Mr. Lord has
<lb/>no idea of employing them as Alexandrines ;—They are
<lb/>merely excessive that is to say defective Pentameters. In a
<lb/>word, judging by his rhythm, we might suppose that the
<lb/>poet could neither see, hear, nor make use of his fingers.
<lb/>We do not know, in America, a versifier so utterly wretched
<lb/>and contemptible.</p><p><pb n="331"/>
</p><p>His most extraordinary sins, however, are in point of Eng-
<lb break="no"/>lish. Here is his dedication, embodied in the very first page
<lb/>of the book:—</p><p></p><p>“ To Professor Albert B. Dod, These Poems, the offspriug
<lb/>of an Earnest (if ineffectual) Desire towards the True
<lb/>and Beautiful, which were hardly my own by Paternity,
<lb/>when they became his by Adoption, are inscribed, with all
<lb/>Reverence and Affection, by the Author.”</p><p></p><p>What is any body to make of all this? What is the
<lb/>meaning of a desire toward?—and is it the “True and
<lb/>Beautiful ” or the “ Poems” which were hardly Mr. Lord’s
<lb/>“ own by paternity before they became his [Mr. Dod’s] by
<lb/>adoption.”</p><p>At page 12, we read:
Think heedless one, or who with wanton step
Tramples the flowers.
At page 75, within the compass of eleven lines, we have
three of the grossest blunders :
Oh Thou for whom as in thyself Thou art,
And by thyself perceived, we know no name,
Nor dare not seek to express—but unto us,
Adonai! who before the heavens were built
Or Earth’s foundation laid, within thyself,
Thine own most glorious habitation dwelt,
But when within the abyss,
With sudden light illuminated,
Thou, thine image to behold,
Into its quickened depths
Looked down with brooding eye !
At page 79, we read :
But ah! my heart, unduteous to my will,
Breathes only sadness: like an instrument
From whose quick strings, when hands devoid of skill
Solicit joy, they murmur and lament.
At page 86, is something even grosser than this:
And still and rapt as pictured Saint might be
Like saint-like seemed as her she did adore.
At page 129, there is a similar error:
With half-closed eyes and ruffled feathers known
As them that fly not with the changing year.
At page 128 we find—
And thou didst dwell therein so truly loved
As none have been nor shall be loved again,
And yet perceived not, etc.
At page 155, we have—
But yet it may not cannot be
That thou at length hath sunk to rest.
</p><p>Invariably Mr. Lord writes didst did'st; couldst could’st,
<lb/>etc. The fact is he is absurdly ignorant of the commonest
<lb/>principles of grammar—and the only excuse we can make to
<lb/>our readers for annoying them with specifications in this re-
<lb break="no"/>spect is that, without the specifications, we should never
<lb/>have been believed.</p><p></p><p>But enough of this folly. We are heartily tired of the
<lb/>book, and thoroughly disgusted with the impudence of the
<lb/>parties who have been aiding and abetting in thrusting it
<lb/>before the public. To the poet himself we have only to say
<lb/>—from any farther specimens of your stupidity, good Lord
<lb/>deliver us!</p><p>The Big Bear of Arkansas, and Other Tales.—Illustrative of charac-
ters and incidents in the South and South-West—edited by W. T.
Porter, with ten original engravings from Designs by Darley. Phil-
adelphia : Carey and Hart.
</p><p>Most of these sketches were originally published in the
<lb/>New York “Spirit of the Times,” where they attracted
<lb/>much attention. The two first in the volume are, we think,
<lb/>much overrated by the editor—they seem to us dull and
<lb/>forced. Many of the others are irresistibly comic and
<lb/>fresh. “ The great Kalamazoo Hunt" is a study in this</p><p></p><p>species of writing ; and “ Swallowing an Oyster ” by our
<lb/>friend Field, of the inimitable “ Reveille,” is a jewel of a
<lb/>thought, set to perfection. The designs by Darley (who has
<lb/>genius of a high order) are good, of course, but not so good
<lb/>as we expect to see front him.</p><p>The Sale of a Distillery : A Pencilling of the Present Age. By Wm.

Lo ! 'tis a gala night
Within the lonesome latter years!
A mystic throng, bewing’d, bediglit
In veils, and drown’d in tears,
Sit in a theatre, to see
A play of hopes and fears,
While the orchestra breathes fitfully
The music of the spheres.
Mimes, in the form of God on high,
Mutter and mumble low,
And hither and thither fly—
</p><p>Mere puppets they, who come and go
<lb/>At bidding of vast formless things
<lb/>That shift the scenery to and fro,</p><p>Flapping from out their Condor wings
Invisible Wo!
That motley drama!—oh, be sure
It shall not be forgot!
With its Phantom chas’d forevermore,
By a crowd that seize it not,
Through a circle that ever returneth in
To the self-same spot,
And much of Madness, and more of Sin,
And Horror the soul of the plot.
But see, amid the mimic rout
A crawling shape intrude !
A blood-red thing that writhes from out
The scenic solitude!
It writhes !—it writhes —with mortal pangs
The mimes become its food,
And the angels sob at vermin fangs
In human gore imbued.
Out—out are the lights—out all!
And, over each quivering form,
The curtain, a funeral pall,
Comes down with the rush of a storm,
And the angels, all pallid and wan,
Uprising, unveiling, affirm
That the play is the tragedy, “ Man,”
Its hero the Conqueror Worm.

MUSICAL REVIEW.
My Cynosure. Words by Park Benjamin, composed for and dedicated
to his friend Wynant Van Zandt, by Hermen S. Saroni.
</p><p>This is a very charming ballad in E flat, suited to a light
<lb/>soprano or tenor voice. The melody cannot be said to be
<lb/>very original, but it is graceful, flowing, and pathetic. The
<lb/>symphony and accompaniments are both pleasing and ad-
<lb break="no"/>propriate, and as a whole it is one of the most pleasing bal-
<lb break="no"/>lads that has come under our notice for a considerable period.
<lb/>The words, by Park Benjamin, are well adapted to music,
<lb/>having the force, passion, and terseness of diction, for which
<lb/>the author is so well known. In the third bar, third line,
<lb/>second page, the A flat in the bass should be A natural.</p><p>Slumber, Infant, Slumber. A duett for two soprano voices, poetry
by R. Moncton Milnes, Esq. M.P., composed and dedicated to Miss
Sarah Henriquez, by Herman S. Saroni.
</p><p>This duett is really beautiful from its simplicity. The
<lb/>melody is most admirably adapted to the words, and we do
<lb/>not know any simple duett that we would more gladly listen
<lb/>to when warbled from the lips of youth and innocence. We
<lb/>think that Mr. Saroni has been extremely fortunate in this
<lb/>composition ; he may write many works of more pretension,
<lb/>but we prophecy for this duett a popularity far beyond
<lb/>his expectation. Were we inclined to be very critical, we
<lb/>might point out a resemblance, and a very marked one, too,
<lb/>in the first phrases, to the well known melody of “ Flow on
<lb/>thou shining River,” but we believe the imitation to have
<lb/>been accidental.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Saroni is a rising and very promising young man. He
<lb/>has a happy faculty of writing for the popular taste, and yet, 
<lb/>with all the necessary simplicity, there is generally a positive 
<lb/>evidence of a power to do greater things. We feel much
<lb/>pleasure in being able to speak of him as he deserves.</p><p></p><p>The poetry of this duett is by a living English poet of
<lb/>well tried celebrity. The sentiment is sad—the language is 
<lb/>simple and touching.</p><p></p><p>We recommend this duett to our readers in all sincerity. 
<lb/>They will find our warm recommendation by no means ex- 
<lb/>aggerated.</p><p>G.	G. Ferari’s celebrated Instruction-Book for the Voice. Published by 
F. Riley, 297 Bowery.
</p><p>Among the numerous vocal Instruction-Books published
<lb/>within the last twenty years, the one now under considera-
<lb break="no"/>tion has best maintained its stand. It has been universally 
<lb/>praised, and is very generally adopted, particularly in En-
<lb break="no"/>gland, where its sale has been really enormous. It is also
<lb/>very much used here, it being popular and comprehensive in
<lb/>its character.</p><p></p><p>The introductory remarks appended by the author, are 
<lb/>very valuable to every one studying the art of singing, and 
<lb/>should be read attentively, over and over again, until the pu-
<lb break="no"/>pil has got them nearly perfect by rote. The examples in- j
<lb/>troduced, should also be studied attentively, as a knowledge 
<lb/>of them will greatly facilitate the acquirement of a correct
<lb/>and tasteful style of reading.</p><p></p><p>The exercises are very copious, comprising most of the
<lb/>difficulties which are to be found in music above the com-
<lb break="no"/>mon standard. Those upon the shake (il trillo) are impor-
<lb break="no"/>tant in many ways, and should be practised in every key. 
<lb/>There are others equally valuable, and equally deserving of
<lb/>especial attention, which we would point out, if we were
<lb/>not so limited in our space. We must, therefore, leave them
<lb/>to be dwelt upon by the teacher, or, if the pupil is studying
<lb/>alone, we must direct the attention particularly to the intro-
<lb break="no"/>ductory remarks, where many special points for practice are
<lb/>strenuously advocated.</p><p></p><p>We can recommend Ferari’s work to teachers and students
<lb/>as an excellent elementary work, well calculated to prepare
<lb/>the voice and mind for more advanced and difficult practice.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Riley has produced a work, valuable to the public,
<lb/>and one, which is also we trust, valuable to himself. He
<lb/>should be well remunerated, for the retting out of such a
<lb/>work as this involves considerable risk in outlay.</p><p>Bohemian Waltzes, arranged from the Bohemian Girl, and dedicated
to Miss S. A. P. Bull, by J. C. Scherpf.
Alpine Horn Quick Step, arranged for the Pianoforte, and dedicated to
Miss Mary C. Baxter, by J. C. Scherpf.
The Alhambra Quick Step, arranged for the Pianoforte, by J. C.
Scherpf.
The Thru Sisters. No. 1 of six Rondinos, for three performers on one
Pianoforte, by Charles C. Zerny.
All of the above pieces published by F. Riley, 297 Broad-
way.
</p><p>No. 1 is a second sett of the Bohemian (Girl) Waltzes.
<lb/>We like them better than the first sett; they are more care-
<lb break="no"/>fully arranged, more natural, more flowing. They make
<lb/>very charming short waltzes, and are certain to gain exten-
<lb break="no"/>sive popularity.</p><p></p><p>In the fifth bar, fourth line, first page in the bass, the chord
<lb/>in the position 4-5 with its resolution, followed by F in the
<lb/>next bar, would have been much better.</p><p></p><p>The two following pieces are very melodious Quick Steps,
<lb/>which must doubtless put a very spirit into the feet of our
<lb/>volunteer companies. When Mr. Scherpf shall pay more
<lb/>attention to his general harmony and rhythm, he will become
<lb/>one of the most popular arrangers of the day.</p><p>The piece by C. Zerny is a very catching show piece, for
three performers on the piano.
</p><p>J. Pirsson’s Pianoforte Manufactory.—A visit to this
<lb/>factory will most amply repay the trouble of a journey of one
<lb/>block down Walker from Broadway. It is a neat, compact,
<lb/>and yet extensive building, covering several lots, and arran-
<lb break="no"/>ged with so much order, that the various departments seem
<lb/>to work one into the other. Mr. Pirsson has always been a
<lb/>hard-working man; by sheer industry and indomitable per-
<lb break="no"/>severance, combined with mechanical skill and practical in-
<lb break="no"/>genuity, he has worked himself to his present rank among
<lb/>the first masters in the city, and enjoys, deservedly, a very
<lb/>large share of public patronage.</p><p></p><p>Having but recently described the manufacture of Piano-
<lb break="no"/>Fortes in our columns, we shall have but little to say on
<lb/>that head ; but there are several important improvements
<lb/>which have been effected in Mr. Pirsson’s factory and paten-
<lb break="no"/>ted by him, about which we purpose saying a few words.</p><p></p><p>The improvement to which Mr. Pirsson attaches the most
<lb/>importance to the Arched Bottom, which differs materially
<lb/>from those used by other makers. He not only finds that it
<lb/>tends greatly to improve the quality of the lone, making it
<lb/>more rich and sonorous, but that it adds most marvellously
<lb/>to the general strength of the instrument, rendering it almost
<lb/>an impossibility, that any portion of the wood work should
<lb/>give way, the breadth of even a hair. This is undoubtedly
<lb/>an improvement, and as such is deserving of considerable at-
<lb break="no"/>tention.</p><p></p><p>The other improvements connected with the action, though
<lb/>of a more minute character, are not the less important,—the
<lb/>reversed lever, by which the power is always preserved
<lb/>equal, and which prevents all noise in the working of the
<lb/>hammers ; also, the improved action of the pedals—an im-
<lb break="no"/>provement very much needed. There are many minor ad-
<lb break="no"/>ditions in the moveable portions of the action all tending to
<lb/>strengthen and perfect it, but of which it is not necessary for
<lb/>us to speak at present.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Pirsson’s Pianofortes are distinguished for the exceed-
<lb break="no"/>ing sweetness, brilliancy and power of their tone, the springy-
<lb break="no"/>ness of their touch, and the beauty of their exterior form, and
<lb/>material and finish.</p><p></p><p>We can recommend these instruments to our friends and
<lb/>the public. Those who wish to see the instruments, will
<lb/>have every facility afforded them by Mr. Pirsson, whose ex-
<lb break="no"/>treme good nature and obliging manners have won him a
<lb/>host of friends, both in and out of the profession.</p><p>THE BROADWAY JOURNAL.
</p><p>Onslaught upon the critics, by one of the Mirror
<lb/>School.—Our remarks under this head have been misun-
<lb break="no"/>derstood by some of our friends. We simply used the words
<lb/>“ by one of the Mirror School” in reference to a remark
<lb/>made in the Evening Mirror, which was something to this
<lb/>effect—“ that the best criticisms upon Music were written
<lb/>by persons who were not professors and who were ignorant of
<lb/>Science.” We are entirely opposed to this opinion, and the
<lb/>person of whom we were writing offering so perfect an illus-
<lb break="no"/>tration of the folly of the remark, we involuntarily termed
<lb/>him “ one of the Mirror School” without intending any of-
<lb break="no"/>fence to the friends of the Mirror.</p><p></p><p>We would on no account institute a comparison between
<lb/>the writers in the two papers, for while we dissent from the
<lb/>opinions of the Mirror Critic, we cannot but admire him for
<lb/>the brilliancy of his imagination and the gentlemanly tone
<lb/>of all his remarks ; and, disputing the truth of the remark
<lb/>which we have questioned above, we believe, sincerely, that
<lb/>were his knowledge as thorough as his feeling of the subject,
<lb/>he would be the best, as he is now the most poetical critic
<lb/>in the country,	______</p><p></p><p>Concert at St. Peter’s Church.—The Grand Sacred
<lb/>Concert announced in our last paper, took place at St. Pe-
<lb break="no"/>ter’s Church on Sunday evening last. The weather had
<lb/>been miserable all day and partially clear a short time pre-
<lb break="no"/>vious to the opening of the doors ; and yet, though the
<lb/>storm doubtless kept hundreds away, there were assembled
<lb/>between six and seven hundred persons.</p><p>The principal performers were Mrs. Loder, Miss De
Luce, Miss Schmidt, Miss Watson, and Mr. Massett.
</p><p>The chorus, all members of the N. Y. Vocal Society, with
<lb/>two exceptions, was full and efficient, and was conducted by
<lb/>Mr. H. C. Watson.</p><p>Mr. W. A. King presided at the Organ and played a most
lovely duett by Mozart, with Mr. H. C. Timm.
</p><p>The selection of music was unexceptionable, being com-
<lb break="no"/>prised entirely of the beauties of the great masters. The
<lb/>Concert gave great and general delight,</p><p>We have been promised a criticism of the performance,
and if it reaches us in time, it shall appear.
FINE ARTS.
</p><p>There are exhibiting in the rooms of the Art Union four
<lb/>landscapes by George Brown of Boston, now in Florence,
<lb/>which will place his name at the head of American land-
<lb break="no"/>scape painters. Two are views in Florence, on the Arno,
<lb/>and two in the Bay of Naples. They bring Italy home to
<lb/>us, are rather take us to her beautiful shores. The view
<lb/>of the “ Castillo de’Ova,” Bay of Naples, we regard as the
<lb/>finest of the four. It is the perfection of landscape paint-
<lb break="no"/>ing ; atmosphere, figures, buildings, water, ships, clouds,
<lb/>and sun-shine are perfect. It is a marvel of art. The
<lb/>“festa of St. John,” a view on the Arno, in Florence, is of
<lb/>a different character, and quite as perfect in its kind, but it
<lb/>is not as pleasing a picture as the other; the architecture is
<lb/>delightful and the river is the purest water that we have 
<lb/>ever seen upon Canvas. We heard Doctor Dewey speak of
<lb/>Mr. Brown as a copyist of Claude, but he has no need to
<lb/>copy Claude or any other painter; he copies nature with
<lb/>rare felicity and in a manner peculiar to himself, which
<lb/>stamps him as a man of genius beyond all doubt or cavil.
<lb/>But those who would enjoy these pictures must look at
<lb/>them with their hearts and thoughts full of nature, and not
<lb/>with a view to compare them with the works of other art-
<lb break="no"/>ists.</p><p></p><p>There is one thing to regret about these paintings, that
<lb/>they should not have fallen into the hands of the Art Union,
<lb/>instead of private individuals. The public would do well
<lb/>to use and examine them before they are removed.</p><p></p><p>In our remarks upon the exhibition we attributed to Mr. Casilear
<lb/>by some unaccountable dip of the pen, a small landscape in the rooms
<lb/>of the Art Union, which was painted by Mr. Durand.</p><p>MISCELLANY.
</p><p>Americans in Europe.—General Tom Thumb is in Paris,
<lb/>where he attracts more attention than any ono of his countrymen
<lb/>has done since the time of Doctor Franklin. One of the most un-
<lb break="no"/>mistakable signs of his popularity is the counterfeiting his name
<lb/>and person by the Theatre des Varietes. But the General’s father
<lb/>procured an injunction upon the counterfeit dwarf, and the great
<lb/>original has all to himself in Paris.</p><p></p><p>Miss Cushman is still performing in London, where she is a
<lb/>ioness, although she never attained to that dignity at home. Mr.
<lb/>Forrest has been at the provinces, where he appears to have been
<lb/>well received.</p><p></p><p>Professor Risley, with the young professors, has been delighting
<lb/>the Russians, in St. Petersburg and Moscow. A Mr. C. Russell,
<lb/>probably a Pennsylvanian, has been doing the people in small
<lb/>English towns, by advertising Concerts, which never came off, and
<lb/>then walking off with the money. Mr. Carter the Lion-tamer, has
<lb/>been a long while creating a sensation in Europe. Mr. Hackett is
<lb/>playing Jonathan Wildfire in Ireland.</p><p></p><p>A mental calculator, in the shape of a boy six years and a half
<lb/>old, had been presented to the French Institute, by the distin-
<lb break="no"/>guished savan, M. Arago.</p><p></p><p>A hew Waterloo Dispatch.—Apropos to the Duke of Wel-
<lb break="no"/>lington’s dispatches. The captain [Allen] of the new packet ship
<lb/>Waterloo of this port, has written home a letter to Mr. Kermick,
<lb/>the agent of his ship, which strikes us a better example of a dis-
<lb break="no"/>patch than any contained in the great English captain. We doubt
<lb/>whether a neater or better written dispatch came from the origin-
<lb break="no"/>al Waterloo after the great fight.</p><p>Liverpool, May 4, 1845.
</p><p>We arrived safe at this port on the first instant, in a passage of
<lb/>nineteen and a half days. For three days after leaving New York we
<lb/>had fine and fair breezes. On the morning of the fourth day, at 9 A.M.
<lb/>our fore-topmast broke short off in the sheave hole, bringing the whole
<lb/>mass of sails, rigging, spars, &amp;c. supported by it, together with the
<lb/>main-topgallantmast, and all above it, down on deck. You may judge
<lb/>our condition, as we had the main-royal and fore-topmast steering,
<lb/>sails set at the time. Fortunately, the weather was fine and a smooth
<lb/>sea, so that we were enabled to save everything without cutting a
<lb/>rope. I cannot account for the topmast’s breaking off. I was on deck
<lb/>at the time, and saw it go; otherwise I could not have believed but
<lb/>that it was done in a squall. It was fortunate our spare topmast was
<lb/>sheaved and ready for use, as the iron sheave went overboard when
<lb/>the mast fell. This has been the hardest job I have ever experienced
<lb/>at sea, as from the length of the top-foremast I had to get down the
<lb/>fore-yard, and almost strip the foremast to get the new topmast up.
<lb/>We had to make new cross-trees. It was two days before we could
<lb/>get sail on the foremast, and in three days we were completely rigged
<lb/>again. It detained us considerably, as the wind came ahead and we
<lb/>could make but poor progress without forward sail. From long. 60
<lb/>to long. 30, we had winds east and northeast; the last five days gave
<lb/>us a fine run. The Waterloo is a fast ship. I am highly pleased with
<lb/>her: she has been much admired in Liverpool. Our passengers were
<lb/>delighted with their passage. Having ample time for it, I will cop-
<lb break="no"/>per the vessel here.</p><p></p><p>Professor Hackley, of Columbia College, delivered a lecture on
<lb/>Tuesday evening last, in the chapel of the college, foot of Park place,
<lb/>on Astronomical science, but with particular reference to the estab-
<lb break="no"/>lishment of an Observatory in the city.</p><p></p><p>Professor Bush, on Thursday evening, delivered a lecture at the
<lb/>Stuyvesanl Institute on the Human Soul, physiologically and theo-
<lb break="no"/>logically considered, in which he adduced a large array of proof, both
<lb/>from reason and scripture, that the proper idea of the soul includes
<lb/>that of a spiritual body, and that consequently the prevalent theory
<lb/>of the future resuscitation of the material body is entirely baseless
<lb/>and delusive.</p><p></p><p>Professor George Tucker has resigned his chair as professor of
<lb/>Moral Philosophy in the Virginia University, the vacancy to be filled
<lb/>on the first of July.</p><p></p><p>The Franking Privilege.—During the discussion in favor of
<lb/>abolishing the franking privilege, it was contended that members of
<lb/>Congress had franked their shirts home to be washed. The romance
<lb/>created a smile, but it seems that something like it has actually oc-
<lb break="no"/>curred. A Mr. Beach, of Georgia, in debate, charged Mr. Giddings
<lb/>of Ohio, with having franked “ a calico frock” marked Pub. Doc. It
<lb/>turns out to have been E. D. Potter, who franked home the frock.
<lb/>The postmaster says it was McNulty’s frank, but the package was
<lb/>directed to Mrs. E.’D. Potter, and at the next mail some more dry-
<lb break="no"/>goods were franked in the same manner. It was time to end this
<lb/>abuse of the franking privilege.</p><p><pb n="334"/>
Park Theatre.—The French company appear here early in June
We copy a list of its members from the Courier des Etats Unis.
</p><p>Prima donna, M'lle Calve, who has left here such a brilliant recol-
<lb break="no"/>lection in the popular mind. Madame Canini, second prima donna,
<lb/>who disputes the palm with M’lle Calve, for talent and grace.
<lb/>Madame Coeuriot, duenna, who is considered by the Louisiana papers
<lb/>as far beyond Madame Lecourt, whose place she lakes, although
<lb/>Madame Lecourt was an excellent actress. M’lle Maria and Eugenie,
<lb/>and Madames Richer et Mathiew, all tour of whom are known to the
<lb/>public. The male part of the company consists of M. Amand, first
<lb/>tenor at the grand opera, who possesses, they say, a first rate voice.
<lb/>M. Coeuriot, first tenor of the comic opera,—Garry, barytone. Douvrv.
<lb/>first bass. Montassier, first youth, of whom every body speaks well;
<lb/>and M. M. Reecher, Dessonville and Mathiew, whom we know al-
<lb break="no"/>ready.</p><p>The orchestra will have M. Eugene Prevot for director, a composer
of great talent, who will be accompanied by six of the most distin-
</p><p>guished musicians of the New Orleans theatre. This orchestra will
<lb/>be completed by the New York artists, whose attention is called to
<lb/>the advertisement in the u Courrier.” The company intend to per-
<lb break="no"/>form the best operas of the French repertoire, among which they men-
<lb break="no"/>tion in advance, Robert le Diable, the Hugenots, the Queen of Cyprus,
<lb/>the Favorite, and La Juive, for which the managers have already
<lb/>gone to considerable expense. It will be seen the programme is a
<lb/>brilliant one.</p><p></p><p>The Sea Serpent,—The Albany Citizen says that there are the re-
<lb break="no"/>mains of a wonderful animal in that city. It is the petrified vertebra
<lb/>of a monster called by the Naturalists Zuyglycon—a creature which
<lb/>must have been half alligator and half whale. It was discovered em-
<lb break="no"/>bedded in a chalk formation on the banks of the Alabama river, and
<lb/>was boxed up and sent to Professor Emmons of that city. The verte-
<lb break="no"/>bra, extending from a portion of the head to the tip of the tail, is
<lb/>eighty feet in length as it lies upon the floor. The creature must have
<lb/>been, in life, from ninety to one hundred feet long.</p><p></p><p>The St. Louis Reveille announces a new book, entitled " The The-
<lb break="no"/>atrical Apprenticeship of Sol. Smith,” by the worthy of that ilk. The
<lb/>work is said to be nearly ready for the press, and is lull of instruction
<lb/>and fun as far as it has been done.</p><p></p><p>T. D. McGee, editor of the Boston Pilot, is about to retain to Ire-
<lb break="no"/>land, to become connected with a leading repeal press there, the Na-
<lb break="no"/>tion. On Tuesday evening, a company of his friends gave him a splen-
<lb break="no"/>did complimentary supper at the Stackpole House.</p><p>A newspaper will shortly be started in the Choctaw nation, to be
conducted by a native editor.
</p><p>" Silvius, or the Roman Odd Fellow,” a new play by A. J. H. Du-
<lb break="no"/>ganne, was so murdered by the Walnut street, Philadelphia, actors,
<lb/>that the author rushed out of the theatre in despair.</p><p></p><p>The Hon. Benjamin F. Butler is to deliver the annual address be-
<lb break="no"/>fore the Belles Letters Society of Dickinson College, on the 9th
<lb/>day of July next, being the day preceding the commencement.
<lb/>Ralph W. Emerson is to deliver the annual address at the com-
<lb break="no"/>mencement at the Wesleyan University in August.</p><p></p><p>Liabilities or an Editor.—Lord Denman has laid down the
<lb/>law recently, that an editor has no right to insert any paragraph
<lb/>before he has ascertained “ that the assertion made in it is absloute-
<lb break="no"/>ly true.” So then, in the case of the late discoveries made by the
<lb/>Earl of Rosse’s telescope, an editor ought to have proceeded to the
<lb/>different planets mentioned before he inserted any statement re-
<lb break="no"/>specting them. According to Lord Denman, the Man in the Moon
<lb/>and Orion would both recover swinging damages from almost every
<lb/>editor in the United Kingdom for the reflections cast by the Earl’s
<lb/>telescope on their characters as planets.—Punch.</p><p>WORKS ISSUED IN LONDON AND EDINBURGH,

</p><p>Mr. Rich respectfully informs his friends and fellow-citizens that he has
<lb/>formed an establishment in Paris, in connexion with his old establishment in Red
<lb/>Lion square, for the purpose of furnishing BOOKS published on the continent
<lb/>without the heavy expense attending their transmission through England.
<lb/>Each of these establishments will be conducted by one of his sons, under his
<lb/>own general superintendence. This new arrangement, he trusts, will prove of
<lb/>signal advantage to his correspondents, and no exertions will be wanting to exe-
<lb break="no"/>cute their orders on the most advantageous terms. Orders may be sent through,
<lb/>and small sums paid to Messrs. Goodhue &amp; Co. of New York. Two and a half
<lb/>per cent, will be allowed to all those who make a remittance with their orders.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Rich, having made Bibliography his special study for forty years, pos-
<lb break="no"/>sesses a knowledge of books and editions not often to be met with, and will be
<lb/>happy to give any advice and information respecting the formation of Libraries
<lb/>or Collections of Books in any particular branch of literature or science. For
<lb/>information in regard to his efficiency, he begs to refer to Messrs. Prescott,
<lb/>Tichnor, Sparks, Irving, and other literary characters in the United States, to
<lb/>whom he is known. Intending to devote the remainder of his life to literary
<lb/>pursuits, his greatest pleasure will arise from sending rare and valuable books
<lb/>to his own country; and he trusts to live long enough to see in the United States
<lb/>a Library which may bear a comparison with the most celebrated in Europe. If
<lb/>he can live to say, “I also assisted in its formation,” his most ardent wishes
<lb/>will be gratified.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Rich has in the press—Bibliotheca Americana Nova : a Catalogue of
<lb/>Books relating to America, including Voyages to the South Seas and round the
<lb/>World : Part III. from 1831 to 1845, with supplement and index completing the
<lb/>work.</p><p></p><p>He has also nearly ready for the press, Bibliotheca Americana vetus : a
<lb/>Catalogue of Books relating to America from the Discovery to the year 1700;
<lb/>with notes and observations: in one volume, 8vo., of about 400 pages.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Rich has also nearly ready, a reprint from Mevenot—Collection of Father
<lb/>Marquette's account of the discovery of the Mississippi, entitled, " Decouverte
<lb/>de quelques Parp et Nations de l'Amerique Septentrionale.” Only 125 copies
<lb/>are printed, which will be distributed among Mr. Rich’s friends and corre-
<lb break="no"/>spondents.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Rich has also purchased the remaining copies of the part relating to
<lb/>America of L’Art de Verifier les Dates: of which ten volumes in octavo, by
<lb/>D. B. Warden, Esq., arc printed, and two volumes more, completing the work,

BERTINI'S METHOD FOR THE PIANO.
THIS is the only thorough, complete and progressive
</p><p>work yet published in this country. Where pupils have used this method
<lb/>the most rapid advancement has been observed in all cases. The most prom-
<lb break="no"/>inent feature of this work is that the lessons, exercises, scales and studies, are
<lb/>given in such PROGRESSIVE order, that they enlist the interest of pupils, and
<lb/>carry them almost imperceptibly through those mechanical difficulties which,
<lb/>otherwise, are too often made irksome in other instruction books. The time
<lb/>has arrived when a superficial knowledge of the Piano is of but little account,
<lb/>and it is only by the study of such methods as Bertini’s that pupils will be en
<lb/>abled to Read music with facility, and at the same time become good musi-
<lb break="no"/>cians.</p><p></p><p>This method commences in the most plain and simple manner ; the rud-
<lb break="no"/>ments of music being given and illustrated at the same time, and each lesson
<lb/>is fully explained by marginal notes on the same page.</p><p></p><p>The publishers are in possession of the highest reccommendations from pro-
<lb break="no"/>fessional gentleman, who speak of the superior merits of Bertini’s Method
<lb/>over all others yet published in this country, most of them having used the
<lb/>foreign copies previously. It will only be necessary to give a few of the
<lb/>names in the principal cities.</p><p>Borrow.	New YoRK.

MR. AND MRS. KIRKLAND’S
SCHOOL FOR YOUNG LADIES,
No. 255 Greene Street,
One door above Waverly Place, New York.
THIS School differs essentially from most others in
this city, in one particular: the number admitted is so limited that each
scholar receives the personal attention and instruction of the principals.
Mr. Kirkland resided some years in Europe for the express purpose of
qualifying himself as an instructor.
The French language is taught by an approved master, a native of France;
and every facility is afforded for practice, both in the school and in the family.
</p><p>The plan of instruction embraces three divisions. The Initiatory Course in-
<lb break="no"/>cludes Grammar, Geography, American History, Writing and Arithmetic,
<lb/>with Composition. Reading aloud, Spelling and Definition, form part of the
<lb/>daily exercises of the whole school.</p><p>The Second continues the above-named studies, with the addition of An-
cient and Modern History and the French Language.
</p><p>In the higher or Aesthetic course all the usual branches of a thorough En-
<lb break="no"/>glish course of education are included, with French, German, Latin and
<lb/>Greek, according to the wish of the parent and the capacity of the scholar.</p><p></p><p>Pupils in this course pay particular attention to Poetry, to the art of Com-
<lb break="no"/>position, and to the Philosophy of History. Moral Philosophy is taught from
<lb/>Dymond, as abridged and prepared for schools by Mrs. Kirkland. Lectures
<lb/>on various subjects are delivered by Mr. and Mrs. Kirkland, and others; and
<lb/>the general course of study is advanced and rendered interesting by copious
<lb/>Illustrations from French and English Literature.</p><p>TERMS.
