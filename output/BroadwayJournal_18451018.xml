Stanzas.
Thou hast eyes like stars, and sweetness
Which no fruit of earth supplies;
Thou hast angel grace, and fleetness,
Like some bird of upper skies;—
Let not earthly charms go higher,
Than the ones which should aspire,—
Be thy spirit like thine eyes—
As to them so lavish given,
Clothe it too in hues of heaven.
Bid it bless where now it kindles,
</p><p>Let not mocking spirits say
<lb/>That thy holy beauty dwindles
<lb/>To a common mortal ray;—</p><p>Be the wicked speech confounded,
Take the captive thou hast wounded,
Prove that eyes, that so can slay,
Have an attribute the more
When the stricken they restore!
W. Gilmore Simms.
King Pest.
A TALE CONTAINING AN ALLEGORY.
The gods do bear and well allow in kings
The things which they abhor in rascal routes.
Buckhurst's Tragedy of Ferrez and Porrez.
</p><p>About twelve o’clock, one night in the month of Octo-
<lb break="no"/>ber, and during the chivalrous reign of the third Edward,
<lb/>two seamen belonging to the crew of the “Free and Ea-
<lb break="no"/>sy.” a trading schooner plying between Sluys and the
<lb/>Thames, and then at anchor in that river, were much as-
<lb break="no"/>tonished to find themselves seated in the tap-room of an
<lb/>ale-house in the parish of St. Andrews, London—which
<lb/>ale-house bore for sign the portraiture of a “Jolly Tar.”</p><p></p><p>The room, although ill-contrived, smoke-blackened,
<lb/>low-pitched, and in every other respect agreeing with
<lb/>the general character of such places at the period—was,
<lb/>nevertheless, in the opinion of the grotesque groups scat-
<lb break="no"/>tered here and there within it, sufficiently well adapted
<lb/>to its purpose.</p><p>Of these groups our two seamen formed, I think, the
most interesting, if not the most conspicuous.
</p><p>The one who appeared to be the elder, and whom his
<lb/>companion addressed by the characteristic appellation of
<lb/>"Legs,” was at the same time much the taller of the
<lb/>two. He might have measured six feet and a half, and
<lb/>an habitual stoop in the shoulders seemed to have been
<lb/>the necessary consequence of an altitude so enormous.
<lb/>Superfluities in height were, however, more than ac-
<lb break="no"/>counted for by deficiencies in other respects. He was
<lb/>exceedingly thin; and might, as his associates asserted,
<lb/>have answered, when drunk, for a pennant at the mast-</p><p></p><p>head, or, when sober, have served for a jib-boom. But
<lb/>these jests, and others of a similar nature, had evidently
<lb/>produced, at no time, any effect upon the cachinnatory
<lb/>muscles of the tar. With high cheek-bones, a large
<lb/>hawk-nose, retreating chin, fallen under-jaw, and huge
<lb/>protruding white eyes, the expression of his countenance,
<lb/>although tinged with a species of dogged indifference to
<lb/>matters and things in general, was not the less utterly
<lb/>solemn and serious beyond all attempts at imitation or
<lb/>description.</p><p></p><p>The younger seaman was, in all outward appearance,
<lb/>the converse of his companion. His stature could
<lb/>not have exceeded four feet. A pair of stumpy bow-legs
<lb/>supported his squat, unwieldly figure, while his unusual-
<lb break="no"/>ly short and thick arms, with no ordinary fists at their
<lb/>extremities, swung off dangling from his sides like the
<lb/>fins of a sea-turtle. Small eyes, of no particular color,
<lb/>twinkled far back in his head. His nose remained buried
<lb/>in the mass of flesh which enveloped his round, full, and
<lb/>purple face; and his thick upper-lip rested upon the still
<lb/>thicker one beneath with an air of complacent self-satis-
<lb break="no"/>faction, much heightened by the owner’s habit of licking
<lb/>them at intervals. He evidently regarded his tall ship-
<lb break="no"/>mate with a feeling half-wondrous, half-quizzical; and
<lb/>stared up occasionally in his face as the red setting sun
<lb/>stares up at the crags of Ben Nevis.</p><p></p><p>Various and eventful, however, had been the peregri-
<lb break="no"/>nations of the worthy couple in and about the different
<lb/>tap-houses of the neighbourhood during the earlier hours
<lb/>of the night. Funds even the most ample, are not al-
<lb break="no"/>ways everlasting: and it was with empty pockets our
<lb/>friends had ventured upon the present hostelrie.</p><p></p><p>At the precise period, then, when this history properly
<lb/>commences, Legs, and his fellow Hugh Tarpaulin, sat,
<lb/>each with both elbows resting upon the large oaken ta-
<lb break="no"/>ble in the middle of the floor, and with a hand upon ei-
<lb break="no"/>ther cheek. They were eyeing, from behind a huge
<lb/>flagon of unpaid-for “humming-stuff,” the portentous
<lb/>words, “No Chalk,” which to their indignation and as-
<lb break="no"/>tonishment were scorefl over the doorway by means of
<lb/>that very mineral whose presence they purported to de-
<lb break="no"/>ny. Not that the gift of decyphering written charac-
<lb break="no"/>ters—a gift among the commonalty of that day consider-
<lb break="no"/>ed little less cabalistical than the art of inditing—could,
<lb/>in strict justice, have been laid to the charge of either
<lb/>disciple of the sea; but there was, to say the truth, a
<lb/>certain twist in the formation of the letters—an indescri-
<lb break="no"/>bable lee-iurch about the whole—which foreboded, in
<lb/>the opinion of both seamen, a long run of dirty weather;
<lb/>and determined them at once, in the allegorical words of
<lb/>Legs himself, to “pump ship, clew up all sail, and scud
<lb/>before the wind.”</p><p></p><p>Having accordingly disposed of what remained of the
<lb/>ale, and looped up the points of their short doublets, they
<lb/>finally made a bolt for the street. Although Tarpaulin
<lb/>rolled twice into the fire-place, mistaking it for the door,</p><p><pb n="220"/>
</p><p>yet their escape was at length happily effected—and
<lb/>half after twelve o’clock found our heroes ripe for mis-
<lb break="no"/>chief, and running for life down a dark alley in the direc-
<lb break="no"/>tion of St. Andrew’s Stair, hotly pursued by the landlady
<lb/>of the “Jolly Tar.”</p><p></p><p>At the epoch of this eventful tale, and periodically,
<lb/>for many years before and after, all England, but more
<lb/>especially the metropolis, resounded with the fearful cry
<lb/>of “Plague!” The city was in a great measure depo-
<lb break="no"/>pulated—and in those horrible regions, in the vicinity of
<lb/>the Thames, where amid the dark, narrow, and filthy
<lb/>lanes and alleys, the Demon of Disease was supposed to
<lb/>have had his nativity, Awe, Terror, and Superstition
<lb/>were alone to be found stalking abroad.</p><p></p><p>By authority of the king such districts were placed
<lb/>-under ban, and all persons forbidden, under pain of death,
<lb/>to intrude upon their dismal solitude. Yet neither the
<lb/>mandate of the monarch, nor the huge barriers erected
<lb/>at the entrances of the streets, nor the prospect of that
<lb/>loathsome death which, with almost absolute certainty,
<lb/>overwhelmed the wretch whom no peril could deter from
<lb/>the adventure, prevented the unfurnished and untenant-
<lb break="no"/>ed dwellings from being stripped, by the hand of night-
<lb break="no"/>ly rapine, of every article, such as iron, brass, or lead-
<lb break="no"/>work, which could in any manner be turned to a pro-
<lb break="no"/>fitable account.</p><p></p><p>Above all, it was usually found, upon the annual win-
<lb break="no"/>ter opening of the barriers, that locks, bolts, and secret
<lb/>cellars, had proved but slender protection to those rich
<lb/>stores of wines and liquors which, in consideration of
<lb/>the risk and trouble of removal, many of the numerous
<lb/>dealers having shops in the neighbourhood had consent-
<lb break="no"/>ed to trust, during the period of exile, to so insufficient
<lb/>a security.</p><p></p><p>But there were very few of the terror-stricken people
<lb/>who attributed these doings to the agency of human
<lb/>hands. Pest-spirits, plague-goblins, and fever-demons,
<lb/>were the popular imps of mischief; and tales so blood-
<lb break="no"/>chilling were hourly told, that the whole mass of forbid-
<lb break="no"/>den buildings was, at length, enveloped in terror as in a
<lb/>shroud, and the plunderer himself was often scared away
<lb/>by the horrors his own depredations had created; leav-
<lb break="no"/>ing the entire vast circuit of prohibited district to gloom,
<lb/>silence, pestilence, and death.</p><p></p><p>It was by one of the terrific barriers already mention-
<lb break="no"/>ed, and which indicated the region beyond to be under
<lb/>the Pest-ban, that, in scrambling down an alley, Legs
<lb/>and the worthy Hugh Tarpaulin found their progress
<lb/>suddenly impeded. To return was out of the question,
<lb/>and no time was to be lost, as their pursuers were close
<lb/>upon their heels. With thorough-bred seamen to clam-
<lb break="no"/>ber up the roughly fashioned plank-work was a trifle;
<lb/>and, maddened with the twofold excitement of exercise
<lb/>and liquor, they leaped unhesitatingly down within the
<lb/>enclosure, and holding on their drunken course with
<lb/>shouts and yellings, were soon bewildered in its noisome
<lb/>and intricate recesses.</p><p></p><p>Had they not, indeed, been intoxicated beyond moral
<lb/>sense, their reeling footsteps must have been palsied by
<lb/>the horrors of their situation. The air was cold and
<lb/>misty. The paving-stones, loosened from their beds, lay
<lb/>in wild disorder amid the tall, rank grass, which sprang
<lb/>up around the feet and ankles. Fallen houses choked
<lb/>up the streets. The most fetid and poisonous smells
<lb/>everywhere prevailed;—and by the aid of that ghastly
<lb/>light which, even at midnight, never fails to emanate
<lb/>from a vapory and pestilential atmosphere, might be dis-</p><p></p><p>cerned lying in the by-paths and alleys, or rotting in
<lb/>the windowless habitations, the carcass of many a noc-
<lb break="no"/>turnal plunderer arrested by the hand of the plague in
<lb/>the very perpetration of his robbery.</p><p></p><p>—But it lay not in the. power of images, or sensations,
<lb/>or impediments such as these, to stay the course of men
<lb/>who, naturally brave, and at that time especially, brim-
<lb break="no"/>ful of courage and of “humming-stuff!” would have
<lb/>reeled, as straight as their condition might have permit-
<lb break="no"/>ted, undauntedly into the very jaws of Death. Onward
<lb/>—still onward stalked the grim Legs, making the deso-
<lb break="no"/>late solemnity echo and re-echo with yells like the ter-
<lb break="no"/>rific war-whoop of the Indian: and onward, still onward
<lb/>rolled the dumpy Tarpaulin, hanging on to the doublet
<lb/>of his more active companion, and far surpassing the
<lb/>latter’s most strenuous exertions in the way of vocal mu-
<lb break="no"/>sic, by bull-roarings in basso, from the profundity of his
<lb/>stentorian lungs.</p><p></p><p>They had now evidently reached the strong hold of
<lb/>the pestilence. Their way at every step or plunge grew
<lb/>more noisome and more horrible—the paths more narrow
<lb/>and more intricate. Huge stones and beams falling mo-
<lb break="no"/>mently from the decaying roofs above them, gave evi-
<lb break="no"/>dence, by their sullen and heavy descent, of the vast
<lb/>height of the surrounding houses; and while actual exer-
<lb break="no"/>tion became necessary to force a passage through frequent
<lb/>heaps of rubbish, it was by no means seldom that the
<lb/>hand fell upon a skeleton or rested upon a more fleshey
<lb/>corpse.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, as the seamen stumbled against the entrance
<lb/>of a tall and ghastly-looking building, a yell more than
<lb/>usually shrill from the throat of the excited Legs, was
<lb/>replied to from within, in a rapid succession of wild,
<lb/>laughter-like, and fiendish shrieks. Nothing daunted
<lb/>at sounds which, of such a nature, at such a time, and
<lb/>in such a place, might have curdled the very blood in
<lb/>hearts less irrevocably on fire, the drunken couple rushed
<lb/>headlong against the door, burst it open, and staggered
<lb/>into the midst of things with a volley of curses.</p><p></p><p>The room within which they found themselves proved
<lb/>to be the shop of an undertaker; but an open trap-door,
<lb/>in a corner of the floor near the entrance, looked down
<lb/>upon a long range of wine-cellars, whose depths the oc-
<lb break="no"/>casional sound of bursting bottles proclaimed to be well
<lb/>stored with their appropriate contents. In the middle of
<lb/>the room stood a table—in the centre of which again
<lb/>arose a huge tub of what appeared to be punch. Bottles
<lb/>of various wines and cordials, together with jugs, pitch-
<lb break="no"/>ers, and flagons of every shape and quality, were scat-
<lb break="no"/>tered profusely upon the board. Around it, upon coffin-
<lb break="no"/>tressels, was seated a company of six. This company
<lb/>I will endeavor to delineate one by one.</p><p></p><p>Fronting the entrance, and elevated a little above his
<lb/>companions, sat a personage who appeared to be the pre-
<lb break="no"/>sident of the table. His stature was gaunt and-tall, and
<lb/>Legs was confounded to behold in him a figure more
<lb/>emaciated than himself. His face was as yellow as saf-
<lb break="no"/>fron—but no feature excepting one alone, was sufficiently
<lb/> marked to merit a particular description. This one con-
<lb break="no"/>sisted in a forehead so unusually and hideously lofty, as
<lb/>to have the appearance of a bonnet or crown of flesh su-
<lb break="no"/>perseded upon the natural head. His mouth was puck-
<lb break="no"/>ered and dimpled into an expression of ghastly affabili-
<lb break="no"/>ty, and his eyes, as indeed the eyes of all at table, were
<lb/>glazed over with the fumes of intoxication. This gen-
<lb break="no"/>tleman was clothed from head to foot in a richly-em-
<lb break="no"/>broidered black silk-velvet pall, wrapped negligently</p><p><pb n="221"/>
</p><p>around his form after the fashion of a Spanish cloak.—
<lb/>His head was stuck full of sable hearse-plumes, which
<lb/>he nodded to and fro with a jaunty and knowing air;
<lb/>and, in his right hand, he held a huge human thigh-
<lb break="no"/>Lone, with which he appeared to have been just knock-
<lb break="no"/>ing down some member of the company for a song.</p><p></p><p>Opposite him, and with her back to the door, was a
<lb/>lady of no whit the less extraordinary character. Al-
<lb break="no"/>though quite as tall as the person just described, she
<lb/>had no right to complain of his unnatural emaciation.
<lb/>She was evidently in the last stage of a dropsy; and her
<lb/>figure resembled nearly that of the huge puncheon of
<lb/>October beer which stood, with the head driven in, close
<lb/>by her side, in a corner of the chamber. Her face was
<lb/>exceedingly round, red, and full; and the same peculiar-
<lb break="no"/>ity, or rather want of peculiarity, attached itself to her
<lb/>countenance, which I before mentioned in the case of the
<lb/>president—that is to say, only one feature of her face
<lb/>was sufficiently distinguished to need a separate charac-
<lb break="no"/>terization: indeed the acute Tarpaulin immediately ob-
<lb break="no"/>served that the same remark might have applied to each
<lb/>individual person of the party, every one of whom seem-
<lb break="no"/>ed to possess a monopoly of some particular portion of
<lb/>physiognomy. With the lady in question this portion
<lb/>proved to be the mouth. Commencing at the right ear, it
<lb/>swept with a terrific chasm to the left—the short pen-
<lb break="no"/>dants which she wore in either auricle continually bob-
<lb break="no"/>ting into the aperture. She made however, every exer-
<lb break="no"/>tion to keep her mouth closed and look dignified, in a
<lb/>dress consisting of a newly starched and ironed shroud
<lb/>coming up close under her chin, with a crimpled ruffle of
<lb/>cambric muslin.</p><p></p><p>At her right hand sat a diminutive young lady whom
<lb/>she appeared to patronise. This delicate little creature,
<lb/>in the trembling of her wasted fingers, in the livid hue
<lb/>of her lips, and in the slight hectic spot which tinged
<lb/>her otherwise leaden complexion, gave evident indica-
<lb break="no"/>tions of a galloping consumption. An air of extreme
<lb/>haul ton, however, pervaded her whole appearance; she
<lb/>wore in a graceful and degage manner, a large and
<lb/>beautiful winding-sheet of the finest India lawn; her
<lb/>hair hung in ringlets over her neck; a soft smile played
<lb/>about her mouth; but her nose, extremely long, thin, sin-
<lb break="no"/>nous, flexible and pimpled, hung down far below her un-
<lb break="no"/>der lip, and in spite of the delicate manner in which she
<lb/>now and then moved it to one side or the other with her
<lb/>tongue, gave to her countenance a somewhat equivocal</p><p>expression.
</p><p>Over against her, and upon the left of the dropsi-
<lb break="no"/>cal lady, was seated a little puffy, wheezing, and
<lb/>gouty old man, whose cheeks reposed upon the shoulders
<lb/>of their owner, like two huge bladders of Oporto wine.
<lb/>With his arms folded, and with one bandaged leg depos-
<lb break="no"/>ited upon the table, he seemed to think himself entitled
<lb/>to some consideration. He evidently prided himself
<lb/>much upon every inch of his personal appearance, but
<lb/>took more especial delight in calling attention to his
<lb/>gaudy-colored surtout. This, to say the truth, must have
<lb/>cost him no little money, and was made to fit him ex-
<lb break="no"/>ceedingly well—being fashioned from one of the curi-
<lb break="no"/>ously embroidered silken covers appertaining to those
<lb/>glorious escutcheons which, in England and elsewhere,
<lb/>are customarily hung up, in some conspicuous place,
<lb/>upon the dwellings of departed aristocracy.</p><p></p><p>Next to him, and at the right hand of the president,
<lb/>Was a gentleman in long white hose and cotton drawers.
<lb/>His frame shook, in a ridiculous manner, with a fit of</p><p></p><p>what Tarpaulin called “the horrors.” His jaws, which
<lb/>had been newly shaved, were tightly tied up by a band-
<lb break="no"/>age of muslin; and his arms being fastened in a similar way at the wrists, prevented him from helping him-
<lb break="no"/>self too freely to the liquors upon the table; a precau-
<lb break="no"/>tion rendered necessary, in the opinion of Legs, by the
<lb/>peculiarly sottish and wine-bibbing cast of his visage.
<lb/>A pair of prodigious ears, nevertheless, which it was no
<lb/>doubt found impossible to confine, towered away into
<lb/>the atmosphere of the apartment, and were occasion-
<lb break="no"/>ally pricked up in a spasm, at the sound of the drawing
<lb/>of a cork.</p><p></p><p>Fronting him, sixthly and lastly, was situated a singu-
<lb break="no"/>larly stiff-looking personage, who, being afflicted with
<lb/>paralysis, must, to speak seriously, have felt very ill at
<lb/>ease in his unaccomodating habiliments. He was habit-
<lb break="no"/>ed, somewhat uniquely, in a new and handsome mahog-
<lb break="no"/>any coffin. Its top or head-piece pressed upon the skull
<lb/>of the wearer, and extended over it in the fashion of a
<lb/>hood, giving to the entire face an air of indescribable in-
<lb break="no"/>terest. Arm-holes had been cut in the sides, for the sake
<lb/>not more of elegance than of convenience; but the
<lb/>dress, nevertheless, prevented its proprietor from sitting
<lb/>as erect as his associates; and as he lay reclining
<lb/>against his tressel, at an angle of forty-five degrees, a
<lb/>pair of huge goggle eyes rolled up their awful whites
<lb/>towards the ceiling in absolute amazement at their own
<lb/>enormity.</p><p></p><p>Before each of the party lay a portion of a skull,
<lb/>which was used as a drinking cup. Overhead was sus-
<lb break="no"/>pended a human skeleton, by means of a rope tied
<lb/>round one of the legs and fastened to a ring in the ceil-
<lb break="no"/>ing. The other limb confined by no such fetter, stuck
<lb/>off from the body at right angles, causing the whole
<lb/>loose and rattling frame to dangle and twirl about at
<lb/>the caprice of every occasional puff of wind which found
<lb/>its way into the aparment. In the cranium of this hi-
<lb break="no"/>deous thing lay a quantity of ignited charcoal, which
<lb/>threw a fitful but vivid light over the entire scene; while
<lb/>coffins, and other wares appertaining to the shop of an
<lb/>undertaker, were piled high up around the room, and
<lb/>against the windows, preventing any ray from escaping
<lb/>into the street.</p><p></p><p>At sight of this extraordinary assembly, and of their
<lb/>still more extraordinary paraphernalia, our two seamen
<lb/>did not conduct themselves with that degree of de-
<lb break="no"/>corum which might have been expected. Legs, leaning
<lb/>against the wall near which he happened to be standing,
<lb/>dropped his lower law still lower than usual, and spread
<lb/>open his eyes to their fullest extent: while Hugh Tar-
<lb break="no"/>paulin, stooping down so as to bring his nose upon a
<lb/>level with the table, and spreading out a palm upon
<lb/>either knee, burst into a long, loud, and obstreprons
<lb/>roar of very ill-timed and immoderate laughter.</p><p></p><p>Without, however, taking offence at behaviour so ex-
<lb break="no"/>cesssvely rude, the tall president smiled very gracious-
<lb break="no"/>ly upon the intruders—nodded to them in a dignified
<lb/>manner with his head of sable plumes—and, arising,
<lb/>took each by an arm, and led him to a seat which some
<lb/>others of the company had placed in the meantime for
<lb/>his accommodation. Legs to all this offered not the
<lb/>slightest resistance, but sat down as he was directed;
<lb/>while the gallant Hugh, removing his coffin tressel
<lb/>from its station near the head of the table, to the vicini-
<lb break="no"/>ty of the little consumptive lady in the winding sheet,
<lb/>plumped down by her side in high glee, and pouring out
<lb/>a skull of red wine, quaffed it to their better acquain-</p><p><pb n="222" break="no" />
</p><p>tance. But at this presumption the stiff gentleman in the
<lb/>coffin seemed exceedingly nettled; and serious conse-
<lb break="no"/>quences might have ensued, had not the president, rap-
<lb break="no"/>ping upon the table with his truncheon, diverted the at-
<lb break="no"/>tention of all present to the following speech:</p><p>“It becomes our duty upon the present happy occa-
sion”—
</p><p>“Avast there!” interrupted Legs, looking very serious,
<lb/>“avast there a bit, I say, and tell us who the devil ye all
<lb/>are, and what business ye have here, rigged off like the
<lb/>foul fiends, and swilling the snug blue ruin stowed away
<lb/>for the winter by my honest shipmate, Will Wimble the
<lb/>undertaker!”</p><p></p><p>At this unpardonable piece of ill-breeding, all the ori-
<lb break="no"/>ginal company half started to their feet, and uttered the
<lb/>same rapid succession of wild fiendish shrieks which
<lb/>had before caught the attention of the seamen. The
<lb/>president, however, was the first to recover his compo-
<lb break="no"/>sure, and at length, turning to Legs with great dignity,
<lb/>recommenced:</p><p></p><p>“Most willingly will we gratify any reasonable curi-
<lb break="no"/>osity on the part of guests so illustrious, unbidden though
<lb/>they be. Know then that in these dominions I am mon-
<lb break="no"/>arch, and here rule with undivided empire under the ti-
<lb break="no"/>tle of ‘King Pest the First.’</p><p></p><p>“This apartment, which you no doubt profanely sup-
<lb break="no"/>pose to be the shop of Will Wimble the undertaker—a
<lb/>man whom we know not, and whose plebeian appellation
<lb/>has never before this night thwarted our royal ears—
<lb/>this apartment. I say, is the Dais-Chamber of our Palace,
<lb/>devoted to the councils of our kingdom, and to other sa-
<lb break="no"/>cred and lofty purposes.</p><p></p><p>“The noble lady who sits opposite is Queen Pest, our
<lb/>Serene Consort. The other exalted personages whom
<lb/>you behold are all of our family, and wear the insignia
<lb/>of the blood royal under the respective titles of ‘ His
<lb/>Grace the Arch Duke Pest-Iferous'—His Grace the Duke
<lb/>Pest-Ilential’—‘His Grace the Duke Tem-Pest’—and
<lb/>‘Her Serene Highness the Arch Duchess Ana-Pest.’</p><p></p><p>“As regards,” continued he, “your demand of the
<lb/>business upon which we sit here in council, we might be 
<lb/>pardoned for replying that it concerns, and concerns 
<lb/>alone, our own private and regal interest, and is in no j
<lb/>manner important to any other than ourself. But in con-
<lb break="no"/>sideration of those rights to which as guests and stran-
<lb break="no"/>gers you may feel yourselves entitled, we will further-
<lb break="no"/>more explain that we are here this night, prepared by
<lb/>deep research and accurate investigation, to examine, an-
<lb break="no"/>alyze,and thoroughly determine the indefinable spirit—
<lb/>the incomprehensible qualities and nare—of those ines-
<lb break="no"/>timable treasures of the palate, the wines, ales, and li-
<lb break="no"/>queurs of this goodly metropolis: by so doing to advance
<lb/>not more our own designs than the true welfare of that
<lb/>unearthly sovereign whose reign is over us all, whose
<lb/>dominions are unlimited, and whose name is ‘Death,’”
<lb/>“Whose name is Davy Jones!” ejaculated Tarpaulin,
<lb/>helping the lady by his side to a skull of liqueur, and
<lb/>pouring out a second for himself.</p><p></p><p>“Profane varlet!” said the president, now turning his
<lb/>attention to the worthy Hugh, “profane and execrable
<lb/>wretch!—we have said, that in consideration of those
<lb/>rights which, even in thy filthy person, we feel no incli-
<lb break="no"/>nation to violate, we have condescended to make reply
<lb/>to thy rude and unseasonable inquiries. We neverthe-
<lb break="no"/>less, for your unhallowed intrusion upon our councils,
<lb/>believe it our duty to mulct thee and thy companion in
<lb/>each a gallon of Black Strap—having imbibed which to</p><p></p><p>the prosperity of our kingdom—at a single draught—and
<lb/>upon your bended knees—ye shall be forthwith free
<lb/>either to proceed upon your way, or remain and be ad-
<lb break="no"/>mitted to the privileges of our table, according to your
<lb/>respective and individual pleasures.”</p><p></p><p>“It would be a matter of utter unpossibility” replied
<lb/>Legs, whom the assumptions and dignity of King Pest
<lb/>the First had evidently inspired with some feelings of re-
<lb break="no"/>spect, and who arose and steadied himself by the table
<lb/>as he spoke—“it would, please your majesty, be a mat-
<lb break="no"/>ter of utter unpossibility to stow away in my hold even
<lb/>one-fourth part of that same liquor which your majesty
<lb/>has just mentioned. To say nothing of the stuffs placed
<lb/>on board in the forenoon by way of ballast, and not to
<lb/>mention the various ales and liqueurs shipped this even-
<lb break="no"/>ing at different sea-ports, I have, at present, a full cargo
<lb/>of ‘humming stuff’ taken in and duly paid for at the
<lb/>sign of the ‘Jolly Tar.’ You will, therefore, please your
<lb/>majesty, be so good as to take the will for the deed—for
<lb/>by no manner of means either can I or will I swallow
<lb/>another drop—least of all a drop of that villanous bilge-
<lb break="no"/>water that answers to the hail of ‘ Black Strap.’”</p><p></p><p>“Belay that!” interrupted Tarpaulin, astonished not
<lb/>more at the length of his companion’s speech than at the
<lb/>nature of his refusal—“Belay that you lubber!—and I
<lb/>say, Legs, none of your palaver! My hull is still light,
<lb/>although I confess you yourself seem to be a litte top-
<lb break="no"/>heavy; and as for the matter of your share of the cargo,
<lb/>why rather than raise a squall I would find stowage-room
<lb/>for it myself, but”——</p><p></p><p>“This proceeding,’’interposed the President, “is by no
<lb/>means in accordance with the terms of the mulct or sen-
<lb break="no"/>tence, which is in its nature Median, and not to be altered
<lb/>or recalled. The conditions we have imposed must be
<lb/>fulfilled to the letter, and that without a moment’s hesi-
<lb break="no"/>tation—in failure of which fulfilment we decree that you
<lb/>do here be tied neck and heels together, and duly drown-
<lb break="no"/>ed as rebels in yon hogshead of October beer!”</p><p></p><p>“A sentence!—a sentence!—a righteous and just sen-
<lb break="no"/>tence!—a glorious decree!—a most worthy and upright,
<lb/> and holy condemnation!” shouted the Pest family alto-
<lb break="no"/> gether. The king elevated his forehead into innumerable
<lb/> wrinkles; the gouty little old man puffed like a pair of
<lb/>bellows; the lady of the winding sheet waved her nose to
<lb/>and fro; the gentleman in the cotton drawers pricked up
<lb/>his ears; she of the shroud gasped like a dying fish; and
<lb/> he of the coffin looked stiff' and rolled up his eyes.</p><p></p><p>“Ugh! ugh! ugh!” chuckled Tarpaulin without heed-
<lb break="no"/>ing the general excitation, “ugh! ugh! ugh!—ugh! ugh!
<lb/>ugh! ugh!—ugh! ugh! ugh!—I was saying," said he,
<lb/>“I was saying when Mr. King Pest poked in his mar-
<lb break="no"/>lin-spike, that as for the matter of two or three gallons
<lb/>more or less of Black Strap, it was a trifle to a tight sea-
<lb break="no"/>boat like myself not overstowed—but when it comes to
<lb/>drinking the health of the Devil (whom God assoilzie)
<lb/>and going down upon my marrow bones to his ill-favored
<lb/>majesty there, whom I know, as well as I know myself
<lb/>to be a sinner, to be nobody in the whole world, but Tim
<lb/>Hurlygurly the stage-player—why! its quite another
<lb/>guess sort of a thing, and utterly and altogether past my
<lb/>comprehension.”</p><p></p><p>He was not allowed to finish this speech in tranquility-
<lb break="no"/>At the name of Tim Hurlygurly the whole assembly
<lb/>leaped from their seats.</p><p>“Treason!" shouted his Majesty King Pest the First-
“Treason!” said the little man with the gout.
“Treason!” screamed the Arch Duchess Ana-Pest.
<pb n="223"/>
“Treason!” muttered the gentleman with his jaws lied
up.
“Treason!” growled he of the coffin.
</p><p>“Treason! treason!” shrieked her majesty of the
<lb/>mouth ; and, seizing by the hinder part of his breeches
<lb/>the unfortunate Tarpaulin, who had just commenced
<lb/>pouring out for himself a skull of liqueur, she lifted him
<lb/>high into the air, and let him fall without ceremony in-
<lb break="no"/>to the huge open puncheon of his beloved ale. Bobbing
<lb/>up and down, for a few seconds, like an apple in a bow)
<lb/>of toddy, he, at length, finally disappeared amid the
<lb/>whirlpool of foam which, in the already effervescent li-
<lb break="no"/>quor, his struggles easily succeeded in creating.</p><p></p><p>Not tamely, however, did the tall seaman behold the
<lb/>discomfiture of his companion. Jostling King Pest
<lb/>through the open trap, the valiant Legs slammed the
<lb/>door down upon him with an oath, and strode towards
<lb/>the centre of the room. Here tearing down the skeleton
<lb/>which swung over the table, he laid it about him with so
<lb/>much energy and good will, that, as the last glimpses of
<lb/>light died away within the apartment, he succeeded in
<lb/>knocking out the brains of the little gentleman with the
<lb/>gout. Rushing then with all his force against the fatal
<lb/>hogshead full of October ale and Hugh Tarpaulin, he
<lb/>rolled it over and over in an instant. Out burst a deluge
<lb/>of liquor so fierce—so impetuous—so overwhelming—
<lb/>that the room was flooded from wall to wall—the loaded
<lb/>table was overturned—the tressels were thrown upon
<lb/>their backs—:the tub of punch into the fire-place—and
<lb/>the ladies into hysterics. Piles of death-furniture flound-
<lb break="no"/>ered about. Jugs, pitchers, and carboys mingled pro-
<lb break="no"/>miscuously in the melee, and wicker flagons encountered
<lb/>desperately with bottles of junk. The man with the
<lb/>horrors was drowned upon the spot—the little stiff gentle-
<lb break="no"/>man floated off in his coffin—and the victorious Legs,
<lb/>seizing by the waist the fat lady in the shroud, rushed
<lb/>out with her into the street, and made a bee-line for the
<lb/>“Free and Easy,” followed under easy sail by the re-
<lb break="no"/>doubtable Hugh Tarpaulin, who, having sneezed three or
<lb/>four times, panted and puffed after him with the Arch
<lb/>Duchess Ana-Pest.	Littleton Barry.</p><p>The Unattainable.
Oft from eventide transitions
And from music’s sweet surprises,
From day-dreams and starlight visions
I can picture paradises—
Ah! if fancies might be things,
Then, of objects sublunary,
Of the whole wide world a-weary,
I would fly to realms of Fancy—
But I want the wings.
Manhood I have never bended
Save before high thrones of Beauty,
</p><p>To Ideals which far transcended
<lb/>Aught that could command my duty
<lb/>On this darkling, desert orb.</p><p>Woman I have loved—but lightly—
Young hearts burn—but burn too brightly—
Theirs is not the flame which nightly
Souls of stars absorb!
Tremulous and transitory,
</p><p>Moths in moonlight, our desires
<lb/>Die, attaining not the glory
<lb/>Which hath won them to its fires,—</p><p>Glimpses of what Heaven allows:
Crowned with ever-living laurel,
Joining in Joy’s anthem choral,
Intellectual and moral
Beauty on our brows!
</p><p>Oh! the consciousness convulses
<lb/>That Hope faints in heavenward mounting,
<lb/>Heart-beats break the heart, and pulses,</p><p>Throb on throb which we are counting,
Are but silent funeral knells,
Felt but heard not—Death is nearer,
All the while those chimes the dearer,
Nature darkening and drearer,
Till she drowns her bells.
Like to Night unstarred and noiseless,
Glooms the grave—and by its portal
Are the glimmering ghost-lights voiceless!
</p><p>Know we that we are immortal?
<lb/>Or is this a dream insane?
<lb/>No—though dim are our discernings,</p><p>We believe that these heart-burnings
From our birth—these God-like yeaanings,
Were not given in vain.
WILLIAM Gibson, U. S. N
The Two Sailor Monkeys.
</p><p>The first of these sailed on board a frigate, and, though
<lb/>always in scrapes, was the favorite both of cabin and
<lb/>ward-room, and indeed of every mess, except the mid-
<lb break="no"/>shipmen’s, being perhaps disliked by these young gentle-
<lb break="no"/>men, for the same reason that poor cousins (as a French
<lb/>author observes) are ill seen by us, to wit, for approach-
<lb break="no"/>ing them too nearly in nature.</p><p></p><p>All his pranks, however provoking at the moment,
<lb/>seemed only to make him a greater favorite with the
<lb/>crew. The captain himself, who studied pug’s happi-
<lb break="no"/>ness as much as the others, and who perhaps thought he
<lb/>might be somewhat steadied by matrimony, was anxious
<lb/>to provide him with a wife.</p><p></p><p>For some time the happiness of the wedded pair ap-
<lb break="no"/>peared to be complete; and the frigate sailed upon a
<lb/>summer cruise during their honeymoon. The husband,
<lb/>however, soon grew indifferent; and indifference was
<lb/>soon succeeded by disgust. This was manifested by an-
<lb break="no"/>gry looks, chatter, and even blows upon the female, per-
<lb break="no"/>severing in her attentions.</p><p>All were much disappointed and scandalized at the
evil suceess of so promising a union.
</p><p>At length, however, an apparent change took place in
<lb/>the husband’s conduct, and was hailed with correspond-
<lb break="no"/>ent joy by the ship’s company. Their pleasure was,
<lb/>however, of short duration, for the traitor, having one
<lb/>fine day decoyed his wife out to the end of the fore top-
<lb break="no"/>gallant yard, as if to shew her something at sea, and set
<lb/>down with her on the spar, slipped his paw under her
<lb/>sitting part and tumbled her overboard. I never shall
<lb/>forget the momentary horror with which this was wit-
<lb break="no"/>nessed by all, with the exception of a French captain,
<lb/>then a prisoner on board, who, turning to the second lieu-
<lb break="no"/>tenant, exclaimed, “Parbleu, Monsieur, ce drole-la a
<lb/>beaucoup de caractère.”</p><p></p><p>Another sailor monkey, who came under my cognizance,
<lb/>if he did not shew so much character (or, to speak bet-
<lb break="no"/>ter English, so much mind) as the first, was certainly
<lb/>a beast of infinite humor. He went to sea, accompanied</p><p><pb n="224"/>
</p><p>by a bear, with a relation of mine, who was captain of a
<lb/>small sloop of war, and who professed to take them with
<lb/>a view to keeping his men in good humor. I believe it
<lb/>was to minister to his own amusement. Probably both
<lb/>objects were attained.</p><p></p><p>The monkey principally extracted his fun from the
<lb/>bear. This beast, who was of a saturnine complexion,
<lb/>indulged himself much in sleeping on the sunny side of
<lb/>the deck. On these occasions the monkey would over-
<lb break="no"/>haul his paws and twitch out any hair which he found
<lb/>matted by tar or pitch, the suffering which to remain
<lb/>seemed to be a great scandal in his opinion.</p><p></p><p>At other times he would open Bruin’s eyelids and
<lb/>peep into his eyes, as if to ascertain what he was drea-
<lb break="no"/>ming about. The bear, irritated at such liberties being
<lb/>taken with his person, used to make clumsy attempts to
<lb/>revenge himself; but his persecutor was off in an in-
<lb break="no"/>stant. The rigging was, on these occasions, his place
<lb/>of refuge. Thither he was indeed followed by his ene-
<lb break="no"/>my; but poor Bruin was but an indifferent top-man, and
<lb/>seldom got beyond lubber’s hole.</p><p></p><p>The monkey, on the contrary, was famous for his ac-
<lb break="no"/>tivity, and for some time was entitled by the sailors,
<lb/>“Deputy-captain of the fore top.” He obtained this de-
<lb break="no"/>signation from a very singular practice. Having ob-
<lb break="no"/>served the excitement produced on deck by the announce-
<lb break="no"/>ment of a sail a-head, which, as well as the chase which
<lb/>followed, seemed to be highly agreeable to him, the fore
<lb/>top became his favorite station; from whence he made
<lb/>his signals with great energy, chattering with a peculiar
<lb/>scream when any vessel was in sight, and indicating by
<lb/>signs in what direction it appeared.</p><p></p><p>Pug continued to volunteer his services for some time
<lb/>in this manner, and constantly found his reward. But
<lb/>at length, upon the sloop’s getting on bad cruising ground,
<lb/>he found his employment dull, and, by way of enlivening
<lb/>it, amused himself with giving false alarms.</p><p></p><p>He was started for this by the boatswain’s-mate, and
<lb/>lost his rank of deputy-captain of the fore-top. In lieu
<lb/>of which, moreover, he was new-named Monk the Ma-
<lb break="no"/>rine; a denomination which he certainly knew to be op-
<lb break="no"/>probrious, as he resented it with grimaces, chatter, and,
<lb/>whenever he dared, with blows.</p><p></p><p>Though he was fond of the excitement of a chase, he
<lb/>was not supposed to have good nerves, and those who
<lb/>had seen him in action (he was, after the first experi-
<lb break="no"/>ment, always sent below) made but an ill report of his
<lb/>steadiness under fire.</p><p></p><p>This poor monkey came to a melancholy end. He had
<lb/>observed a sick lieutenant, who breakfasted after the rest
<lb/>of his mess, making his tea, and being accidentally left
<lb/>alone in the gun-room, determined to imitate him. He
<lb/>however succeeded ill in his mixture; for he infused a
<lb/>paper of tobacco which was lying on the table, into the
<lb/>pot, instead of tea, and afterwards swallowed it with its
<lb/>accompaniments of milk and sugar. This ill-imagined
<lb/>beverage produced the most fearful commotion in his in-
<lb break="no"/>side, attended with long and loathsome vomitings; of
<lb/>which he finally died.</p><p></p><p>The doctor, who was a materialist and an atheist, and
<lb/>a most quarrelsome fellow, (he had killed two brother
<lb/>officers in duels, one for only calling him Dr. Gallipot,)
<lb/>attended him with more care than we had expected;
<lb/>but the poor beast (as the purser said) was outward
<lb/>bound, and could not be recalled.</p><p>The surgeon pronounced that pug died of the iliac pas-
sion, and announced this as a reason for believing that
man was but a better breed of monkey.*
To a Spirit. 
From the far-off Spirit Land,
Dost thou hail I
For thy thin and shadowy hand,
And that face so meek and bland,
And so pale,
And thy voice, so faint and lone,
And its melancholy tone,
Tell the tale.
O’er those herbless plains and drear,
Do these glide—
’Mid that voiceless atmosphere,
</p><p>The shadows of the dear
<lb/>That have died?
<lb/>Cold, cheerless and alone,</p><p>Each to each unknown,
Side by side?
’Neath that sky so low and gray,
Like a cell—
Where the changeless twilight day
Never warms the mist away,
Do they dwell?—
Those funereal crowds,
With the grave-damp on their shrouds?
Spirit, tell!
Would a single shade obey,
</p><p>Should I call 1
<lb/>Or, divested from this clay
<lb/>And its passions, do they stray
<lb/>'Neath that pall,</p><p>Unhearing and unseeing,
With a blank and vacant being.
Lifeless all?
</p><p>Of the Past do they retain
<lb/>Not a gleam?
<lb/>Or doth a hope remain
<lb/>They shall ever wake again
<lb/>To that dream</p><p></p><p>Of Love, which o’er the wave
<lb/>Of the Lethe of the grave
<lb/>Casts its beam?</p><p></p><p>I care not. Com’st thou here
<lb/>To command
<lb/>A mortal to appear
<lb/>In that world of doubt and fear,</p><p>The Spirit Land?
Of a life of pain I tire,
Thou art here at my desire—
Give thy hand!
Remorse I feel not now,
Nor shall feel;
</p><p>There’s no brand upon the brow
<lb/>(For a brother) that I bow
<lb/>To thy will:</p><p>But a sell-sustaining trust
In the Merciful and Just,
Arms me still.
Tis gone—a mournful shade,
As it came,

As if smitten and dismayed,
And in shame.

When an evil phantom flies

A Mountain Village.
</p><p>The eastern extremity of the Taurus Mountains in
<lb/>Nassau, though little known to English tourists, would
<lb/>well repay those who might be tempted to explore it.— 
<lb/>This part of the chain presents, in its narrow pastoral
<lb/>valleys, clear purling streams, and wooded heights, sce-
<lb break="no"/>nery of the utmost beauty, differing from that nearer to
<lb/>the Rhine in its character of sylvan solitude, and perhaps
<lb/>surpassing it in variety. The district here referred to
<lb/>might he fairly included within a triangle drawn be-
<lb break="no"/>tween the towns of Wiesbaden, Frankfort, and Hamburg.</p><p></p><p>One of the most beautiful homes of this district is Epp-
<lb break="no"/>stein, ten miles distant from Wiesbaden, and delightfully
<lb/>situated at the point of junction of four different valleys. 
<lb/>“This village,” says the author of An Autumn near the
<lb/>Rhine, “is one of the most wild sequestered abodes of,
<lb/>man I ever beheld. Though almost all the mountain vil-
<lb break="no"/>lages in Germnny have the same feudal character in 
<lb/>their buildings and positions, I should select Eppstein in
<lb/>preference, on giving the most perfect notion of the se-
<lb break="no"/>cluded fastness of a feudal baron and his vassals. Eve-
<lb break="no"/>rything here carries one back to the days of chivalry.— 
<lb/>The situation of the village, wedged in a narrow defile,
<lb/>between rocks and mountains, in the centre of a wild
<lb/>district remote from the habitations of man, and where
<lb/>nothing but the object of security could induce any mor-
<lb break="no"/>tal to pitch his camp—the solid walls and low portals
<lb/>which inclose about twenty or thirty mean houses—the 
<lb/>massive towers and donjons of the old baronial castle, 
<lb/>perched, like an eagle’s nest, on the most accessible point,
<lb/>of rock overhanging the village—the winding approach
<lb/>up the mountain half hid with brushwood—everything
<lb/>transports one back to the thirteenth or fourteenth cen-
<lb break="no"/>tury; and a slight stretch of imagination might people
<lb/>the scene with the grim figures of the Count Gedefroi, or
<lb/>the Count Eberhard of Eppstein and his mailed attend-
<lb break="no"/>ants, arriving under the castle turrets from an encounter
<lb/>with a neighboring knight. The village and its inhabi-
<lb break="no"/>tants have an air of uncivilized and primitive rudeness,
<lb/>which does not ill accord with the illusion.”</p><p></p><p>The family of Eppstein seems nearly as old as that of
<lb/>Nassau: many of its members were chancellors of the
<lb/>empire and archbishops of Mayence. One of them crown-
<lb break="no"/>ed the Emperor Frederick Barbarossa, at Aix-la-Chapelle,
<lb/>and afterwards was made Patriarch of Jerusalem. The
<lb/>line became extinct in the sixteenth century: several of
<lb/>their monuments still exist in the village church.</p><p></p><p>“The founder of the family was, of course, a hero;
<lb/>and the report of the neighborhood is, that a knight, na-
<lb break="no"/>med Eppo, hunting in the forest hard by, heard the sobs
<lb/>and lamentations of a female, whom, on penetrating in-
<lb break="no"/>to the forest, he found seated on a rock by the side of a
<lb/>cave, wiping away her tears with her long tresses, and
<lb/>Pouring forth bitter lamentations. She told him she was
<lb/>chained there by a giant, who had slain her kindred, and
<lb/>carried her away from her father’s castle. The giant
<lb/>Was absent in the forest, but returned every day to sleep
<lb/>at noon, on the summit of the mountain. Sir Eppo vow-</p><p></p><p>ed to deliver her; and the lady entreated him to go to
<lb/> her castle in the neighborhood, and procure from the
<lb/>blind warder a magical net hanging up in the hall,
<lb/>which her father had brought as a booty from Palestine.
<lb/>The knight hastened to procure the net, and stretched it
<lb/>on the spot where the giant slept. The lady strewed it
<lb/>over with flowers—the giant lay down in it—was taken,
<lb/>and hurled from the summit of the rock by the knight
<lb/>to the valley below, of course the lady gave her hand
<lb/>to her deliverer. The knight built a castle on the rock,
<lb/>which he called Eppstein, (Eppo’s rock,) and here he
<lb/>dwelt with his bride. To prove the truth of the story,
<lb/>a whale’s rib, deposited over the gateway, is still point-
<lb break="no"/>ed out as one of the giant’s bones.”</p><p>About three miles from Eppstein, is Konigstein: the
road whither lies through the pretty vale of Fischbach.
</p><p>“The whole landscape, the hanging woods, variously
<lb/>tinted by autumn, the jutting rocks, the sombre sequest-
<lb break="no"/>ered recesses in the glen, and the lonely stillness which
<lb/>pervades the scene, sometimes remind one of some of the
<lb/>least wild of Salvator’s romantic scenes, or of thә cool
<lb/>and lovely valleys of Gaspar Poussin.”</p><p>The Wife's Prayer.
Hear me!—Oh, hear me now!
By the red flush upon thy wasted cheek—
By the deep tracery o’er thy noble brow,
Hear me! bear with me, husband! while I speak!
I’ve marked thee day by day —
Thy hours are all of anxious, vague unrest—
Thine eye hath caught a stern, unwonted ray—
Thy lip hath lost all memory of its jest.
Thy wife sits pale beside—
Thy child shrinks back appaled from thine embrace—
Thy menials quail before thy mien of pride—
Thy very dog avoids thine altered face!
O! for poor Glory’s wreath,
Casting from thee all tenderness and gladness;
Thou track’st a phantom on, whose fiery breath
Drielh the way founts till thou thirst to madness!
My prayer is all for thee—
My life is thine! by our remembered bliss—
By all thine hours of watchful misery—
What meed hath fame to render thee for this!
If thou yet lov’st me, hear!
Now, while thy feet press onward to the goal,
Turn thee! oh! turn thee in thy stem career,
And thrust this mad Ambition from thy soul!
Mary E Hewitt.
The Bishop and his house-Keeper.
</p><p>In a city in the south of France, which we will not
<lb/>name at present, there lived a few years ago a bishop, a
<lb/>kind, amiable old man severe to himself, indulgent to
<lb/>others, so good and charitable that everybody loved him.
<lb/>His house was a model of propriety and hospitality; it
<lb/>was managed by an old housekeeper, Madame Pichard.
<lb/>In a bachelor’s establishment the supreme authority is
<lb/>always exercised by a lady. Madame Pichard was the
<lb/>very model of housekeepers, and everything went on ad-
<lb break="no"/>mirably under her administration. Her only source of
<lb/>trouble was her husband, a drunken, quarrelsome old
<lb/>man, who at the time of our story, was carried off by a</p><p><pb n="226"/>
</p><p>dropsy produced by his excesses. A few days after his
<lb/>death the bishop went up to his housekeeper’s apart-
<lb break="no"/>ments to pay her a visit of condolence.</p><p></p><p>“Well, my dear madam,” began his lordship, “I have
<lb/>called to endeavor to console you in your afflictions.
<lb/>You must not grieve too deeply: we are all mortal you
<lb/>know, and sooner or later we come to the end of our
<lb/>earthly pilgrimage; your husband’s is now ended—it
<lb/>would have been better if he had not spent so much of
<lb/>it in drinking, but still the mercy of heaven has no
<lb/>bounds.”</p><p></p><p>“Your lordship is very good; but, to say the truth, I
<lb/>was not thinking of my husband at all; I will not de-
<lb break="no"/>ceive you.”</p><p></p><p>This was a kind of funeral oration for which the bish-
<lb break="no"/>op was hardly prepared, and it was with no little aston-
<lb break="no"/>ishment that he replied—</p><p>“That is not a very Christian frame of mind, I’m
afraid; did you not love your husband?”
“Your lordship would not ask me that question, if you
knew how I came to be married.”
You must tell me all about it,” said the bishop, with
the curiosity of age.
</p><p>“And your lordship does not know anything about my
<lb/>Augustus,” continued the housekeeper, in a melancholy
<lb/>tone.</p><p>“Your Augustus, Madam Pichard? Pray explain.”
</p><p>“I was born at Boulogne, if it please your lordship.
<lb/>At fifteen they called me the village beauty, and I sup-
<lb break="no"/>pose, when eighteen, I was not much uglier ; but excuse
<lb/>me, Sir,” said the old lady, drawing back her chair, “I
<lb/>am going to tell you a love-story, and I shall only tire
<lb/>you.”</p><p></p><p>“Go on,” repeated the dignitary, “we are both of us
<lb/>old now, and can talk about such nonsense without any
<lb/>danger.”</p><p></p><p>“There lived in the village a young man, tall, finely
<lb/>formed, with blue eyes, and curling light hair; I think I
<lb/>can see him now; all we girls used to pull caps for him; he
<lb/>was what our parents called a wild young man; his
<lb/>name was Augustus, and we all used to call him ‘ hand-
<lb break="no"/>some Gussy.’ He soon singled me out, and when my
<lb/>father went to Paris, and my mother was out of the way,
<lb/>he was always at my side. When one gets to be an old
<lb/>woman, and has a great grown-up girl to take care of,
<lb/>one rails at lovers; but still that was the happiest time
<lb/>of my life—I remember it as if it was yesterday. I was
<lb/>proud of my Gussy, who was our village beau, and he
<lb/>soon quitted all the other girls to pay his court to me.
<lb/>All this sounds very strange to your lordship, no doubt.
<lb/>My father and mother would never have agreed to my
<lb/>marrying so wild a fellow as he was; they forbade him
<lb/>the house, but we used often to meet in secret; he would
<lb/>prowl around all day only to get a single look of me, and
<lb/>then, oh how happy and proud I was! One day, my
<lb/>father had gone to the city with a load, and I slipped
<lb/>out to try and see Augustus for a moment; we had not
<lb/>seen each other for a fortnight! I met him in the high-
<lb break="no"/>road. If your lordship knew what a delight it is to meet
<lb/>one’s lover, when one is just eighteen, and has been part-
<lb break="no"/>ed from him a fortnight, you would comprehend what
<lb/>one feels; I forgot father, mother, everything. We stood
<lb/>under a tree by the road-side, looking into each other’s
<lb/>eyes; we were so happy we did not even speak. A cart
<lb/>came along, it was my father’s; he saw us, sprung out,
<lb/>and began to beat me for having met Augustus against
<lb/>his orders. I am certain that if he had attacked Augus- </p><p></p><p>tus himself, he would not have resisted; but the poor
<lb/>fellow could not bear to see me suffer, he attacked my
<lb/>father, and they fought desperately. My father caught
<lb/>up a stone, and split open Augustus’ head; he on the oth-
<lb break="no"/>er hand, dealt the old man such a blow that he fell
<lb/>senseless.”</p><p></p><p>“Oh, run, run, Augustus!” said I, “if the police should
<lb/>catch you, you are lost!” He obeyed me, and fled, and I
<lb/>have never seen him since. My father soon came to, and
<lb/>gave me a dreadful beating. He detetmined to marry
<lb/>me off, and easily found a man to take me without any
<lb/>affection, in consideration of a good dower. When I was
<lb/>tired of being beaten every morning and night, I became
<lb/>Madam Pichard. I never loved my husband; he knew
<lb/>that my father used to beat me, and he followed his ex-
<lb break="no"/>ample. We wandered over the whole of France, in great
<lb/>want and misery for the most part, till your lordship’s
<lb/>kindness gave us support. That is my story.”</p><p>“And what became of handsome Gussy?”
</p><p>“He thought he had killed my father, and left the vil-
<lb break="no"/>lage. He was a lad of courage; no doubt he enlisted;
<lb/>perhaps he is now a colonel, goneral, or count, who
<lb/>knows? unless he was killed in'battle. But I cannot be-
<lb break="no"/>lieve he is dead; I have been looking for him these forty
<lb/>years; I expect every moment to hear him knock at
<lb/>the door, and see him come in with his graceful figure,
<lb/>his mild blue eyes and waving locks.</p><p>“ So, then, you suppose, my good lady, that your Gussy
is just the same now as he was then?”
“So I fancy, please your lordship.”
</p><p>“Why, that is folly; your Augustus has grown old like
<lb/>other men; by this time his face must be wrinkled, his
<lb/>head bald and his figure bent double. If you were to see
<lb/>him now, you would not know him.”</p><p></p><p>“Oh, that’s impossible! I can’t believe that he’s so
<lb/>changed; but at any rate I should know him among a
<lb/>thousand. Put him in the middle of an army, and I’ll lay
<lb/>my life I’d recognise him at the very first.”</p><p></p><p>“You are mistaken, madam; you dwell in fancy on
<lb/>the youth of twenty, not on the old man of sixty-five; and
<lb/>Augustus, himself, if he was to see you, would not know
<lb/>you. To prove this, you have both of you lived six
<lb/>months in my house without either’s ever suspecting that
<lb/>the other was—”</p><p>“What? what does your lordship mean ?” asked the
old woman anxiously.
</p><p>“To undeceive you, Margaret—lam your Augustus.”
<lb/>Madame Pichard sprung up from her chair, and held
<lb/>up both hands; she could not believe him.</p><p>“Oh dear! is your lordship ‘ handsome Gussy?’”
“Certainly.”
“The handsomest young fellow in the village?”
“Yes, Margaret, forty-five years ago.”
“Was it you that I used to meet down in our garden?”
“Alas! yes, Margaret.”
“Was it you, your lordship—I mean Augustus—I mean
your lordship, that my father hit with a stone?”
The dignitary took off his scull-cap, and shewed a dis-
tinct scar on his shaven crown.
</p><p>“I can tell you all in a very few words. When I
<lb/>thought I had killed your father, I fled across the frontier.
<lb/>I took refuge in a convent; the good fathers gave me an
<lb/>education; I wanted to go back to France and claim
<lb/>your hand. When I heard of your marriage I determined
<lb/>to take orders; I abandoned the idle pursuits of my youth
<lb/>and devoted myself to study and prayer. I returned to
<lb/>France; I preached thirty years, when I was nominated</p><p><pb n="227"/>
</p><p>to the see I now occupy. You must stay with me, Mar-
<lb break="no"/>garet; we are both of us so old and so changed now that
<lb/>there is no danger in the remembrance of the past. You
<lb/>see now that your fancy was fed by mere illusion, the
<lb/>object of your first love was before your eyes, yet you did
<lb/>riot know him, nor he you. Nothing is lasting in this
<lb/>world, my child; all is vanity and vexation of spirit.”
<lb/>Madame Pichard contined to be the very model of a
<lb/>careful housekeeper. The servants stood in awe of her,
<lb/>and believed that she was crazy, for they often heard her
<lb/>mutter to herself when she thought she was alone,—</p><p>“Oh dear! his lordship my handsome Gussy—oh dear!
oh dear!

<lb/>VIII. Big Abel and The Little Manhattan. By Cor-
<lb break="no"/>nelius Mathews.</p><p></p><p>In our notice of this work, a week or two since, we
<lb/>promised a quotation, by way of instancing the author’s
<lb/>very peculiar style and tone. We proceed now to re-
<lb break="no"/>deem our word, by copying some passages from the epi-
<lb break="no"/>sode, or rather interlude, of the Poor Scholar and his
<lb/>Mistress. These passages are, perhaps, as idiosincratic
<lb/>as any in the volume:</p><p></p><p>Turning, at a bend, they found, in the heart of the bend itself,
<lb/>the very thing they looked for, a little garden or house of refresh-
<lb break="no"/>ment. Not much of a garden; a slip of the size of a handker-
<lb break="no"/>chief; green, too; and a fountain (something very small in the
<lb/>way of a fountain); and bowers, ever so many of them, at least
<lb/>three in number. And here, while they were getting served by a
<lb/>nice mistress of the place, as busy in all her motions as though
<lb/>she had opened that morning, and heard a couple of hundred call-
<lb break="no"/>ing her all at once, with cream, and cakes, and fruit (Lankey’s
<lb/>part was fruit alone), there drew nearer to a bower; it was the
<lb/>centre, and pride of the garden that was waiting for them; two
<lb/>young persons, one of them very pale, the other all a-glow.</p><p></p><p>Was ever a Poor Scholar's mistress in such spirits before! And
<lb/>then the way in which she took possession of the bower; if the
<lb/>green chair had been of solid gold she could’nt have treated it
<lb/>more grandly. Three rape of the knuckles, and there was a ban-
<lb break="no"/>quet—not much of a one, to be sure—but what of that! William
<lb/>bad something to say, that was clear; but such spirits as Mary’s
<lb/>—why the stoutest man living would have quailed before them,
<lb/>much less a poor scholar.</p><p>“The Book’s to be printed, Will? I believe you admit that at
last!"
“To be sure it is—they’ve accepted it.”
</p><p>“A happy time of it for the printers, now! turning all your
<lb/>gentle fancies out upon the page; making your mirth laugh, your
<lb/>sorrow weep; your little men and women grow again in light,
<lb/>and take a shape to every human eye, all the wide world over!—
<lb/>Oh what dreams they’ll have the first night. They’ll not sleep a
<lb/>wink, I fear, with all your magic over!”
<lb/>foolish Mary!</p><p></p><p>"And then the binder’s girls, who have the folding of them
<lb/>daintily! Many a clipping of wages will they lose this very
<lb/>week, lingering, as they should not, naughtily about that wicked
<lb/>Book!"</p><p>Mary, too fanciful by half.
</p><p>“Tuesday, now! By Friday, at the latest, that little bright-eyed,
<lb/>clean-apparelled gentleman (your Book, I mean, Will) must come
<lb/>own stairs, and begin to see company! Oh for the first look at
<lb/>his sweet and cheerful face!"</p><p>In the young Scholars heart that was settled long ago.
</p><p>“The show-bills, now! All over town, speaking up, with
<lb/>fresh, clean looks! Coaxing every one to slop and read! Every
<lb/>one to hurry in and buy! and then away to taste the dainty to
<lb/>his core!”</p><p>Was there ever such a foolish, thoughtless mistress to a Poor
Scholar; all the world over I
</p><p>She stopped and looked at Will as though she saw a Blessed
<lb/>Spirit, stepped out from the sun, and not a mortal man. But he
<lb/>was very pale, and still had something to say, and now could
<lb/>say it.</p><p>You forget Germany, Mary!” That was what he had to
say.
</p><p>No: she didn’t She reccollected it perfectly well; it was in all
<lb/>the maps, upon the globes, and hung up in the windows- But in
<lb/>this connection she didn’t reccollect it, she confessed. What was
<lb/>Germany to this?</p><p></p><p>She hadn’t heard of a famous Rendering or translation out of
<lb/>that country, that was talked about, a mighty book, with such a
<lb/>power of chains, by way of binding up and riveting the reader;
<lb/>such a thrilling, enchanting, wonderful and miraculous book?
<lb/>Strange, she hadn’t heard of that I That was the Book?
<lb/>What, to come betwixt this Book of William’s and the light of
<lb/>day?</p><p></p><p>William was pale, I said, and Mary now, too. Had those
<lb/>men who played these changeful tricks stood there, or sate within
<lb/>that bower, they must have been torn piece-meal, limb by limb, by
<lb/>little angry devils, leaping out of Mary’s eyes, a score at once,
<lb/>and many score!</p><p></p><p>When they had gone forth, Big Abel and Lanky (how Poor
<lb/>William and his mistress got away, heaven, whence it came
<lb/>from, knows!), the shower was deepening, and they made quickly
<lb/>for a house not far away. And there it was. That little, tidy,
<lb/>shining palace of brick; palace it is in the spirit within;
<lb/>sitting by itself; in cleanliness and purity, and through all the
<lb/>falling rain eyeing calmly all passers-by with his little winking
<lb/>knob and bell-pull.</p><p></p><p>At home? The ladies of this mansion are always at home,
<lb/>and have been any time these fifty years- A snug parlor, every-
<lb break="no"/>thing tidy, everything in a high state of polish, everything demure
<lb/>and settled calmly in his place. The plaster-rabbits on the mantel,
<lb/>not zoologically perfect, inasmuch as the necks are movable, anil
<lb/>have no visible appurtenance to the bodies; and yet, to the mind,
<lb/>all that could be reasonably expected of rabbits under such cir-
<lb break="no"/>cumstances. A little door is slided open, and out of a back room
<lb/>a nice, comfortable, smiling body—Seventy! Yes; this was the
<lb/>youngest of the two maiden sisters, Big Abel’s friends, living here.
<lb/>Pretty good for Seventy! Cheerful, quick of speech and gait, and
<lb/>cordial, too, as the days of hearty June are long. Another ap-
<lb break="no"/>pearance out of the back room—Eighty! Not so tall, nor quite
<lb/>so stout, but more cheerful, quicker of motion, decidedly more
<lb/>cordial. There was a great shaking of hands, I tell you, there!
<lb/>No difference made between fair-looking Abel and the swarthy
<lb/>Lanltey—not the least) Talk! Plenty of it; and after that there
<lb/>came, out of the back room, too, a little square table, which was
<lb/>suddenly clothed (by Eighty) with a snowy cloth, and put in pos-
<lb break="no"/>session (by Seventy) of a little family of cups and saucers, then of
<lb/>a dainty pile of toast, then of a cold ham, then of a steaming pot,
<lb/>and the little table was set up in the world, and ready to do busi-
<lb break="no"/>ness.</p><p></p><p>Wiley &amp; Putnam’s Library of Choice Reading. No.
<lb/>XXVI. Selections from the Works of Taylor, Lati-
<lb break="no"/>mer, Hall, Milton, Barrow, South, Brown, Fuller and
<lb/>Bacon. By Basil Montagu, Esq., M. A. First Ame-
<lb break="no"/>rican from the Fifth London Edition.</p><p></p><p>This is a book we may safely take on our faith in the
<lb/>good taste and discretion of the American editor. He
<lb/>has been a diligent laborer in the vineyard of old Eng-
<lb break="no"/>lish Literature for many years; and we have no doubt
<lb/>he has a sincere pleasure in seeing the public coming
<lb/>round to the manlier standard of the earlier writers—
<lb/>These selections, we need scarcely say, are well made.</p><p><pb n="228"/>
</p><p>They are from the picked greatness of English prose;
<lb/>the bounty, the vigor, the spirit and breadth of the old
<lb/>giant-race of authors, who were men and wrote for men.
<lb/>They have no fear, but a full faith in the generous fecun-
<lb break="no"/>dity of nature, and teem on every hand with expression
<lb/>and truth and life. The passages from the modern Ed- 
<lb/>ward Irving, given in the notes (which are to the pur-
<lb break="no"/>pose, and copious) are in a like temper, and abide the
<lb/>comparison without loss of credit to the eccentric divine.</p><p></p><p>At some other day, when our pages are less crowded,
<lb/>it will give us pleasure to spread some of these choice
<lb/>selections before our readers—if they are not before us
<lb/>by a resort to the publishers, and a mastery of the whole
<lb/>feast in advance of our grudging convenience.</p><p>Praise and Principle; or For What Shall I live. By
the author of “Conquest and Self Conquest” New-
York: Harper if Brothers.
</p><p>If we say that this book is evidently written by a sen-
<lb break="no"/>sible, discreet, judicious woman, we indicate all its best
<lb/>properties as well as though we dwelt on it through a
<lb/>dozen pages. The style is clear and simple, the senti-
<lb break="no"/>ments excellent and proper, and the narrative gracefully
<lb/>conducted to the end.</p><p></p><p>It indicates in various passages a greater knowledge j
<lb/>of life, in its actual, out-of-door struggles, than generally
<lb/>falls to those who can write with such lady-like proprie-
<lb break="no"/>ty and refinement. We have been particularly impressed
<lb/>by the naturalness and good judgment with which her
<lb/>school-boy scenes are managed: they are in an excellent
<lb/>tone, and denote in the writer quick sympathies and an
<lb/>observant eye. The nice taste of the authoress is shown,
<lb/>as might be expected, even in the selection of her mot-
<lb break="no"/>toes: they are obviously of her own choosing. The book
<lb/>is, in a word, of a kind we are glad to see: we hope it
<lb/>will not only be—it has already been to no inconsiderable
<lb/>degree—a source of honor to its fair writer, but may be
<lb/>such in all its results as to prompt and encourage her to
<lb/>further undertakings of the same kind. Constant pur-
<lb break="no"/>chasers as such books are likely to command, and a few
<lb/>copy-rights like this, well deposited in the hands of li-
<lb break="no"/>beral publishers, should be an estate for the gentle worne.</p><p>Littell's Living Age. No 73.
</p><p>Mr. Littell is the compiler of a valuable miscellany
<lb/>published in Boston, of generally liberal sympathies, but
<lb/>has not entirely escaped provincial preferences. This is
<lb/>shown by the apparent eagerness with which unfriendly
<lb/>notices of writers without New England are spread up-
<lb break="no"/>on his pages from the English journals. A singular ex-
<lb break="no"/>ample of this occurs in the present number, where an un-
<lb break="no"/>favorable notice of a New-York author is picked out of
<lb/>many favorable ones, and a favorable notice of a New
<lb/>England historian is picked out of many unfavorable
<lb/>ones.</p><p>Wiley if Putnam's “Foreign Library."
</p><p>A Prospectus has been issued of this new undertaking,
<lb/>which has grown out of the popular series of books in
<lb/>“The Library of Choice Reading,” with an eye to a con-venient division of the volumes for the Library. The
<lb/>Foreign Library will be published uniformly with the
<lb/>other, with equal attention to the beauty of the typogra-
<lb break="no"/>phy, and the excellence of the editions, and at equally
<lb/>low rates. By the publishers' announcement it will in-
<lb break="no"/>clude the leading classic works of the Foreign languages,
<lb/>both ancient and modern—the latter being a new and im-</p><p></p><p>portant feature of the undertaking—with such works of
<lb/>miscellaneous literature as may be worthy a permanent
<lb/>place in the Library. The historical works of Schiller
<lb/>are announced, Goethe’s Wilhelmmeister, Mitchell’s
<lb/>Translation of Aristophanes, &amp;c. The first numbers will
<lb/>be Bensenerto Cellini’s Memoirs, the full and elaborately
<lb/>illustrated edition of Roscoe; a valuable and delightful
<lb/>work, for its historical and personal interest, which Ho-
<lb break="no"/>race Walpole pronounced “more amusing than any no-
<lb break="no"/>vel, and of which a complete translation is included in
<lb/>the works of Goethe. We shall have more to say of the
<lb/>plan and the books hereafter.</p><p>The Fine Arts.
</p><p>We are indebted to the kindness of Mr. C. Edwards
<lb/>Lester, for permission to extract some passages, this
<lb/>week, from his forthcoming work, “The Artist, the Mer-
<lb break="no"/>chant, and the Statesman.” The quotation will speak
<lb/>for itself:—the words are those of Powers.</p><p></p><p>I have endeavored in these two statues to avoid anything that
<lb/>could either by form or import offend the purest mind; and to ac-
<lb break="no"/>complish my design better, I have left out any expression in ei-
<lb break="no"/>ther of them of a consciousness of their nudity. In the Eve this
<lb/>is inferred of course—" for they were naked and were not asham-
<lb break="no"/>ed”—indeed, they knew not that they were naked. But in the
<lb/>Slave, as it is a subject of our own times, we could not suppose
<lb/>this under ordinary circumstances—but there art circumstances
<lb/>under which it might be supposed, and I selected a subject that
<lb/>would justify this.</p><p></p><p>The Slave has been taken from one of the Greek Islands by the
<lb/>Turks, in the time of the Greek Revolution; the history of which
<lb/>is familiar to all. Her father and mother, and perhaps all her
<lb/>kindred, have been destroyed by her foes, and she alone preserved
<lb/>as a treasure too valuable to be thrown away. She is now among
<lb/>barbarian strangers, under the pressure of a lull recollection of
<lb/>the calamitous events which have brought her to her present state;
<lb/>and she stands exposed to the gaze of the people she abhors, and
<lb/>awaits her fate with intense anxiety, tempered indeed by the sup-
<lb break="no"/>port of her reliance upon the goodness of God. Gather all these
<lb/>a Auctions together, and add to them the fortitude and resignation
<lb/>of a Christian, and no room will be left for shame. Such are the
<lb/>circumstances under which the Greek Slave is supposed to stand.</p><p></p><p>Every one remembers having listened to the sound of the sea-
<lb break="no"/>shell, when we hear what the poets call "the murmur of the sea.”
<lb/>But if is not so generally known that the shell is supposed to give
<lb/>warning of the approach of a storm. I had an impression this
<lb/>superstition was confined to America; but many of my visitors
<lb/>have told me it is general throughout the world. Everybody
<lb/>knows the cause of the sound we hear in the shell, which is a
<lb/>species of ear trumpet, that magnifies feeble sounds to such a de-
<lb break="no"/>gree, that they become much more audible, and are echoed from
<lb/>the large end of the trumpet, provided the small end be shut, so
<lb/>strangely, and in such a peculiar manner as to resemble, by the
<lb/>aid of the fancy, the roar of the waves of the sea. There have
<lb/>been several beautiful pieces written on this; particularly by Dry-
<lb break="no"/>den and Wordsworth; but none have alluded to the shell as an
<lb/>oracle of the weather. To represent this peculiar superstition (if
<lb/>indeed it be all superstition), I have made a small statue of a boy
<lb/>of a light and delicate form, and an Innocent expression, holding
<lb/>a shell to his ear with his left hand, while with the right he sup-
<lb break="no"/>ports a net and the tiller of his boat. He is standing upon the
<lb/>sand, and near his feet are some small shells and sea-weed, to de-
<lb break="no"/>note the magin of the ocean.</p><p></p><p>This figure is a kind of Appolonio, but the character is mod-
<lb break="no"/>ern; for I hold that artists should do honor to their own limes and
<lb/>their own religion, instead of going back to mythology to illus-
<lb break="no"/>trate, for the thousandth lime, the incongruous absurdities and in-
<lb break="no"/>consistencies of idolatrous times, especially as our times and our</p><p><pb n="229"/>
</p><p>religion are lull of subjects equal in beauty, and all the qualities
<lb/>necessary to a full development ot art. Why cling to a Jupiter,
<lb/>when our Saviour affords us a greater than parallel subject?—
<lb/>Why a Hercules, while we have a Samson? Why an Apollo,
<lb/>while we have a Moses who is peculiar, and, with the exception
<lb/>of a Jupiter, more noble than them all 1 Then with the other sex
<lb/>mythology affords no Eve, no Miriam, no Virgin Mary, no Mag-
<lb break="no"/>dalen, no Rebecca, no Jeptha’s daughter, no Angels, no Michael,
<lb/>no Gabriel, no Ithuriel; and I might mention a hundred other
<lb/>characters equally adapted to sculptural and pictorial representa-
<lb break="no"/>tions.</p><p></p><p>I do not cite these as parallel subjects exactly, but as themes
<lb/>which may afford as fine opportunities for the display of human
<lb/>genius in art, as the ancients had in old time; and I believe in
<lb/>very many respects they are calculated to draw out a finer moral
<lb/>feeling, and, consequently, a loftier sentiment and a more exalted
<lb/>genius. This is a consideration not too commonly advanced, or
<lb/>entertained; but it should not be forgotten, that art rises in its per-
<lb break="no"/>fection just in proportion to the purity and moral majesty of the
<lb/>subject of which the artist treats. Many a great artist has at.
<lb/>tempted a lewd theme, but he never made a great work; and there
<lb/>are no remains of ancient or modem art, I am bold to say, that
<lb/>‘'ear with them any clear indication of lofty genius, which shock,</p><p></p><p>At any considerable degree, the loftier and purer feelings. God,
<lb/>in His cunning wisdom, has wrought deep into the constitution
<lb/>of all things the great law, that sublimity and excellence of every
<lb/>kind are in a more or less intimate relation with purity. If you
<lb/>find anything beautiful, very beautiful, you are just as sure to
<lb/>find something pure. This is illustrated strikingly in those remains of ancient art, which have so long attracted the gaze, and</p><p>excited the admiration of mankind.
</p><p>In the Laocoon, which sends the cold shudder through one, years
<lb/>after he saw it first; in the stately and superb group of Niobe an
<lb/>her children, which awakens every generous and lofty emotion of
<lb/>the human soul; in the head of Brutus, which carries you back to
<lb/>the streets of Rome before her Ceasars; and in</p><p></p><p>“That bending statue which delights the world,"
<lb/>where the chisel of Cleomenes has transmitted to all coming times
<lb/>the perfection of ideal beauty:—in all these great gems of antiquity, where Greece and Rome have exhausted their genius, and been
<lb/>contending for the palm of sculpture for two thousand years—there
<lb/>is loftiness, there is sublimity, there is the perfection of beauty
<lb/>And why is it so? Why have they lived and been transmitted
<lb/>from age to age? and why shall they be transmitted to future ages</p><p>for ever!—They are pure!	
</p><p>I believe that we may, under the guidance of this principle, sur-
<lb break="no"/>pass the ancients in art, as far as the religion of the fishermen of Ga-
<lb break="no"/>lilee surpasses the filthy dreams of their mythology. I well know
<lb/>we may fail to do it, too; and I am persuaded we shall fail, until
<lb/>we abandon their subjects, and a wretched servile imitation of
<lb/>their works.</p><p></p><p>But a step further. I have seen either the originals or good casts
<lb/>of nearly all the celebrated representations of our Saviour, and,
<lb/>with a few exceptions, they portray the humility, meekness and be-
<lb break="no"/>nevolence that are supposed to have been peculiar to him; but in
<lb/>none of these, if I except the Ivory Christ of yours-cut by an un-
<lb break="no"/>seated monk at Genoa, have lever seen that expression of mind,
<lb/>of divine gracefulness which must have been just as peculiar to
<lb/>his wonderful character. It would be enough for us to know that,
<lb/>that he were the Prince of Peace to know the one, and it is enough
<lb/>for us to know that he is the Son of God to convince us of the sec-
<lb break="no"/>ond- When we read the New Testament we are guided to a
<lb/>conclusion in which we cannot be mistaken; and I have always
<lb/>felt that Milton was the only Christian of modem writers who has
<lb/>drawn the person and the character of the Son of God with just
<lb/>conceptions of his intellect, his majesty and his grandeur, as we
<lb/>find it drawn by the simple but inspired pens of the apostles.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps the statue of Christ by Thorwalsden embodies more of
<lb/>this conception than anything ever executed in marble, in
<lb/>great man seldom made a failure; and he has gone over a
<lb/>the whole empire of sculpture. There is a very touching incident
<lb/>connected with his Christ. He first made the disciples and sold
<lb/>‘hem to his Government at Copenhagen. He then executed for</p><p>them his Christ, and presented it to them “without money and
without price” to complete the group.
</p><p>Some have said, and others no doubt will affirm that a grand
<lb/>masculine character is inconsistent with the mildness and benevo-
<lb break="no"/>lence of the Saviour; but I do not think so. As a proof that all
<lb/>these characteristics may be written in one individual, I need on-
<lb break="no"/>ly mention the bust of Washington by Houdon—where we see not
<lb/>only the highest degree of goodness and benevolence, but all the
<lb/>elements of the most grand and lofty character. I have heard
<lb/>foreigners delare, while gazing on this bust, that he was not only
<lb/>the best of men, but the wisest and most majestic of all human
<lb/>beings. His bust expresses the fulness of his character. There
<lb/>is no head among all the ancients so grand and noble; and while
<lb/>looking at it, I have often questioned myself after the following
<lb/>manner: if I wanted counsel, he is the man I would go to; if I
<lb/>wanted one to defend me, here is one with the courage and the
<lb/>prudence to do it; a confidant, who so trustworthy; a friend, who
<lb/>so constant? But there are certain qualities not to be found there.
<lb/>He was a practical man, and not a poet. I should never expect
<lb/>rhetorical eloquence from such a man, nor low wit, nor anything

</p><p>Grand Oratorio at the Tabernacle.—Beethoven’s
<lb/>Mount of Olives, and Dr. Loewe’s Seven Sleepers, were
<lb/>performed at the Tabernacle on Thursday evening, under
<lb/>the direction of Mr. George Loder. The vast building
<lb/>was more crowded upon this occasion than we ever re-
<lb break="no"/>member to have seen it; there could not have been less
<lb/>than three thousand people present. This fact proves tri-
<lb break="no"/>umphantly that the name of any Society has but little to
<lb/>do with attracting people; good performances given un-
<lb break="no"/>der the direction of a competent person, and upon a scale
<lb/>of respectable magnitude, will never fail to ensure a large
<lb/>share of public patronage. The small amount of con-
<lb break="no"/>certs of choral kind given in this city, during the few
<lb/>past years, has caused us both surprise and regret. There
<lb/>is such a vast field for entertainments of this kind, such
<lb/>an endless quantity of fine choral works, both ancient and
<lb/>modern, and so strong a feeling in favor of this class of
<lb/>music among the body of the people, that it becomes a
<lb/>matter of surprise that but one choral Society should ex-
<lb break="no"/>ist in this great city. We could, however, give the key
<lb/>to this mystery, but we will leave it for some future oc-
<lb break="no"/>casion. We cannot however leave this portion of our
<lb/>subject, without congratulating our readers and the pub-
<lb break="no"/>lic generally, upon the establishment of this large body
<lb/>of amateurs, under the direction of Mr. Loder, for we
<lb/>have already seen the good fruits which spring from it.
<lb/>Mr. Meiggs, the projector of the concerts, deserves our
<lb/>thanks for his enterprising spirit, and the public an equal
<lb/>share for their discrimination in supporting him so libe-
<lb break="no"/>rally. May they continue to work together, to their mu-
<lb break="no"/>tual satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>Beethoven’s great work, the Mount of Olives, forms a
<lb/>striking instance of the combination of the sublime and
<lb/>the beautiful. Several of the solos are exquisite in their
<lb/>melody, of a chastly, passionate and pathetic character,
<lb/>interspersed with passages of great beauty; while the
<lb/>choruses are distinguished for their singularly dramatic
<lb/>or rather descriptive qualities. The last chorus, “Hal-
<lb break="no"/>lelujah to the Father,” in grandeur and sublimity of
<lb/>thought and expression, not even Handel, in his moments</p><p><pb n="230"/>
</p><p>of highest inspiration, could hardly equal—certainly not
<lb/>excel What can be more vividly descriptive than the
<lb/>chorus of “Roman Soldiers,” “He came towards this
<lb/>Mountain,” and the following one in which the Disciples
<lb/>arә supposed to join in with the Soldiers, who cry,
<lb/>“ Here, seize him—we have found him who dares him-
<lb break="no"/>self to call the Mighty King of Israel”? While the Dis-
<lb break="no"/>ciples murmur out fearfully, “The Soldiers seek our Mas-
<lb break="no"/>ter; what dreadful fate awaits Him surrounded by His
<lb/>foes.” Nothing can exceed these compositions in vigor
<lb/>of thought, boldness of design, and artistical effect by
<lb/>powerful contrast.</p><p></p><p>How entirely truthful is the trio, “My soul with rage
<lb/>and fury for just revenge o’erflows.” This is a bold and
<lb/>impetuous movement, indicating the feelings of the fiery
<lb/>Disciple, who would strive to avert his Master’s fate, by
<lb/>force of arms. He is answered by this mild reply, “No,
<lb/>thou shalt do no murder! the lesson of meek patience
<lb/>taught by the Son of God, is love and peace on earth,
<lb/>good will to man.” The great beauty of this movement
<lb/>can only be imagined, by getting the words deeply en-
<lb break="no"/>graven on the heart, and then thinking them in music.
<lb/>Altogether the trio is a masterly work, and reminds us,
<lb/>in its situation and design, of that exquisite trio, “The
<lb/>flocks shall leave the Mountain,” in Handel’s charming
<lb/>Seranata, acis Galatea.</p><p></p><p>The next point of beauty that we arrive at in this com-
<lb break="no"/>position—and it is its crowning beauty—is the instru-
<lb break="no"/>mentation. It is in this that Beethoven rises above all
<lb/>his competitors, if we except Mendelssohn Bartholdy;
<lb/>for as an instrumentalist he will, we believe, ever stand
<lb/>pre-eminent. To attempt to describe instrumentation,
<lb/>would be to strive to do that which cannot be done, but
<lb/>thus far we can say that the only instrumentation that ri-
<lb break="no"/>ses to an art, is that which carries out the thought—not
<lb/>a mere accompaniment, subservient to the voice, but an
<lb/>integral portion of the idea, which without it would be
<lb/>but. the bare outline. The instrumentation is the color-
<lb break="no"/>ing of the tone-picture—forms its lights and shadows,
<lb/>and imparts its grand effects. Of such a sort is the par-
<lb break="no"/>tition of the Mount of Olives, and without doubt it is the
<lb/>highest of its class. After our definition of instrumenta-
<lb break="no"/>tion as an art, and the position we have awarded to that
<lb/>of the Mount of Olives, to say more upon the subject
<lb/>would be useless.</p><p></p><p>We regret that we cannot award much praise to the
<lb/>solo singers. The music is too difficult for Mrs. Strong,
<lb/>and also for Mr. Pearson. There is a hardness about
<lb/>Mrs. Strong’s style, a want of delicate finish, and a cold-
<lb break="no"/>ness of manner, which renders her execution of such mu-
<lb break="no"/>sic, in a measure painful to hear. She has one peculiari-
<lb break="no"/>ty totally at variance with the style of Sacred Music:—
<lb/>we allude to her staccato method of execution. Even the
<lb/>simple turn (which by the by she uses most lavishly and
<lb/>not in the best taste) even the simple turn, we say, she
<lb/>sings staccato, and every note of every cadence is as dis-
<lb break="no"/>tinctly articulated as it would be in a marked passage
<lb/>for a flute where every note is tongued. Mrs. Strong re-
<lb break="no"/>quires more portamento in her singing, which if acquired
<lb/>would produce a fine effect with her beautiful voice.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Pearson sang his music very correctly, but it ran-
<lb break="no"/>ges too high for his compass of voice. He also wants
<lb/>finish; he has a method of drawling out his notes, and a
<lb/>bad habit of broad pronunciation, which produce a style
<lb/>smacking much of the country psalm-singing. These de-
<lb break="no"/>fects could be remedied by a strong infusion of vigor and
<lb/>careful study for a purer intonation. We should be de-</p><p></p><p>lighted to find our suggestions acted upon, for Mr. Pear-
<lb break="no"/>son has been gifted by nature with a voice which pro-
<lb break="no"/>perly trained would be a fortune to him.</p><p></p><p>Mr. S. Pearson had not much to do, but what he did he
<lb/>did respectably. Of the chorus we cannot speak too
<lb/>highly. Never have we heard in this city so large a bo-
<lb break="no"/>dy of choristers so admirably well trained. To use a
<lb/>homely expression, everything went like clock-work.—
<lb/>There was no hesitation, no wavering, from the begin-
<lb break="no"/>ning to the end of the performance, including both Ora-
<lb break="no"/>torios. The choruses we have mentioned in the Mount
<lb/>of Olives were executed in a masterly manner, not only
<lb/>as regards precision and force, but in sentiment and ef-
<lb break="no"/>fect. They were subdued to a whisper—they rose to the
<lb/>crescendo, and overwhelmed our ears upon the fortissimo.
<lb/>Upon no occasion were the fugues in the Seven Sleepers
<lb/>so clearly developed; hitherto a certain degree of confu-
<lb break="no"/>sion was evident—the points did not come out distinctly—
<lb/>but on this occasion every opposing point was made out
<lb/>with remarkable fidelity and force. The Alto voices told
<lb/>out admirably, the Second Trebles were capital, and the
<lb/>Basses were remarkably prompt and efficient: nor were
<lb/>the other voices deficient in excellence, although we must
<lb/>remark that the Tenors were, for a short time, sadly out
<lb/>of tune (flat) in the first chorus in the second act of the
<lb/>Seven Sleepers.</p><p></p><p>The band was better controlled than upon any other
<lb/>vocal concert ever given in this city. The accompani-
<lb break="no"/>ments to the Mount of Olives, require the most delicate
<lb/>execution, and excessive promptness, to render them ef-
<lb break="no"/>fective, and so admirably did the band perform on this
<lb/>occasion, that it appeared to every one the prominent
<lb/>beauty of the Oratorio. The Violins were excellent;
<lb/>also the wind instruments, particularly the Flutes and
<lb/>Fagotti. Indeed it is invidious to point out any portion
<lb/>for particular praise, so admirablә was the whole.</p><p></p><p>The Oratorio of the Seven Sleepers has been so fully
<lb/>discussed during the last two weeks, that any remarks
<lb/>upon its merits on this occasion would be out of date.
<lb/>We will say however, that being better understood it
<lb/>was better appreciated and that it evidently gains favor
<lb/>with the public on each performance.</p><p></p><p>Mrs. Strong and Mrs. S. Pearson acquitted themselves
<lb/>better in this than in the previous Oratorio. Mrs. E.
<lb/>Loder by her chaste and classical style, pure intonation,
<lb/>and emphatic enunciation, won the approbation of the
<lb/>large assembly in the part of Malchus the youngest of the
<lb/>Seven Brothers. Miss De Luce displayed her fine voice
<lb/>to great andvantage, and the other solo performers ac-
<lb break="no"/>quited themselves very creditably.</p><p></p><p>Mr. H. C. Timm displayed his usual skill at the organ,
<lb/>bringing it in most judiciously to enforce the fortes and
<lb/>to strengthen the Bass in the Organ points.</p><p></p><p>Mr. George Loder has added still more to his already
<lb/>extensive, and well earned reputation. He has all the
<lb/>qualities necessary for a conductor, energy, firmness, ap-
<lb break="no"/>preciation, refined taste and knowledge, and to all these
<lb/>qualifications he adds experience to direct them all. We
<lb/>congratulate him upon his successful performance.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Loder announced from the Orchestra that early in
<lb/>November, Mendelssohn's magnificent Oratorio of St.
<lb/>Paul, would be produced under his direction. We are
<lb/>glad of this for it is the greatest Sacred Composition of
<lb/>modern days.</p><p>THE BROADW AY JOURNAL.

</p><p>Worcester’s Piano Forte Manufactory.—Having
<lb/>occasion to visit this establishment a few weeks since,
<lb/>our ears were assailed, on every side, by the “busy note
<lb/>of preparation” for the autumn campaign. We saw
<lb/>around us a very large number of instruments in every
<lb/>stage of advancement, besides a formidable array finish-
<lb break="no"/>ed and ready to be sent from the factory. We tried and
<lb/>examined many of the finished instruments, and feel much
<lb/>pleasure in recommending them cordially to our friends
<lb/>and the public. The seven octave pianos pleased us the
<lb/>most; they are brilliant, full toned, and substantial in-
<lb break="no"/>struments, and would wear out a half a dozen of the more
<lb/>popular, but less carefully made pianos, the interior be-
<lb break="no"/>ing considered of more consequence than the exterior by
<lb/>Mr. Worcester; although the exteriors are all carefully
<lb/>and elegantly finished.</p><p></p><p>We trust that our professional friends and the purchas-
<lb break="no"/>ing public will call upon Mr. Worcester, at his factory,
<lb/>139 Third Avenue, corner of Fourteenth street, and judge
<lb/>for themselves of his instruments.</p><p></p><p>The Bell Ringers, under the direction of Mr. Corbyn,
<lb/>have been literally coining money the past week in New-
<lb break="no"/>York, Boston and other places. They are at present in
<lb/>this city, and all who have not heard them, would do well
<lb/>to visit them this week, as they start en route for Mexico
<lb/>in a few days, and will not return probably for two years.</p><p></p><p>Wherever they go, we wish them success, for they in
<lb/>every way merit it, and our good wishes extend most cor-
<lb break="no"/>dially to their worthy director, Mr. Corbyn.</p><p></p><p>The Cheney Family gave a concert on Monday last.
<lb/>We arrived too late to hear them, but we have been told
<lb/>that their performance was excellent. They should be
<lb/>encouraged.</p><p></p><p>We are unable to notice Mr. Templeton’s performance
<lb/>this week, in consequence of the early hour at which we
<lb/>go to press; but we will do him ample justice in our
<lb/>next.</p><p></p><p>Trinity Church Organ.—The beautiful engraving of
<lb/>this splendid instrument, which we promised our readers
<lb/>last week, will be delivered with our present number.—
<lb/>We must apologise for the delay, which was caused by
<lb/>an accident which could not be avoided in time for publi-
<lb break="no"/>cation.</p><p></p><p>A few fine impressions of this remarkable instrument,
<lb/>on extra sized paper, are on sale at the office, 135 Nassau
<lb/>atreet, price 12 1/2 cents, including the paper which con-
<lb break="no"/>tains the description.</p><p></p><p>We have received numbers 1 and 2 of a new periodi-
<lb break="no"/>cal called the Boston Musical Review, edited by G. W.
<lb/>Peck, Esq., and published by L. H. Bridgeman, 6 Water
<lb/>Street Boston. It is published every two weeks; con-
<lb break="no"/>tains one sheet of twenty-four duodecimo pages; price
<lb/>three dollars a year in advance. Musical periodicals,
<lb/>conducted with a view to the encouragement and im-
<lb break="no"/>provement of the science, are much needed, and when
<lb/>found worthy should be liberally encouraged by the pro-
<lb break="no"/>Profession, by amateurs, and by all lovers of the Art.
<lb/>The numbers of the Boston Musical Review before us,
<lb/>contain some interesting articles, and some articles
<lb/>which had better been omitted. The essays on Musical
<lb/>expression contain some very clever writing, and display</p><p></p><p>fair appreciation of the subject, but we confess we have
<lb/>very little faith in the influence of Musical essays. The
<lb/>style in the first place is happily exploded, and in the
<lb/>next place the taste of those who read periodicals de-
<lb break="no"/>voted to Music, is opposed to such a dry mode of convey-
<lb break="no"/>ing information, and tends to that style which discourses
<lb/>of passing events and things of present interest. The
<lb/>essay style may please six out of every thousand readers
<lb/>but those who would do good to any science must write
<lb/>for the mass and not for the few.</p><p></p><p>With regard to its character as a science, we can
<lb/>scarcely at present form an opinion, though from what
<lb/>we have as yet seen we should think the  'Reviews’ will
<lb/>prove to be notices by no means critical. We shall,
<lb/>however, be glad to know that the work succeeds, for
<lb/>every help that is given to the cause of Music should be
<lb/>welcomed cordially.</p><p></p><p>New-York Musical Convention.—We were in error
<lb/>in stating last week that this Convention was got up
<lb/>chiefly for the sale of Boston books. We were, howev-
<lb break="no"/>er, only to a certain extent in error; if New-York be sub-
<lb break="no"/>stituted for Boston, the sentence would contain the fact.
<lb/>Patent Music Books, of all descriptions, were crowded
<lb/>into every pew in the Tabernacle, and printed circulars
<lb/>descriptive of the extraordinary merits of each of them,
<lb/>were scattered everywhere about. We cannot for a mo-
<lb break="no"/>ment doubt that if these works were properly apprecia-
<lb break="no"/>ted, every man, woman and child would be accomplished
<lb/>musicians in less than no time.</p><p></p><p>We had determined to report fully the proceedings of
<lb/>this Convention; but on attending its sittings, we found
<lb/>it to be, as we expected, nothing more nor less than a
<lb/>solemn humbug. We were surprised that such a farce
<lb/>could be enacted in the city of New-York, but we were
<lb/>pleased to find that no musician of eminence was present
<lb/>to sanction such a mockery. It is true that Dr. Hodges
<lb/>and Mr. Hill were present; but Dr. Hodges merely ad-
<lb break="no"/>dressed the meeting, and the members of the Convention
<lb/>will not readily forget the caustic severity of that address.
<lb/>The patent-book men must have felt especially small.</p><p></p><p>Well, this Convention met and propounded a list of
<lb/>questions for discussion, so trivial in themselves that they
<lb/>threw into the shade the sensibilities evolved in the ar-
<lb break="no"/>guments pro and con. We will not trouble our readers
<lb/>with the eighteen questions before the Convention, but
<lb/>we copy a clever satire, in which the questions will be
<lb/>discovered; and we assure our readers that it contains
<lb/>more common sense than was uttered during the sitting
<lb/>of this remarkable Convention:</p><p></p><p>1.	Resolved, That the obstacles to the advancement of Sacred
<lb/>Musie are so formidable that the least said at present about them
<lb/>the better.</p><p></p><p>2.	That there are many practical benefits from oratorial singing
<lb/>to psalmody, but as all persons have not musical ears, there is no
<lb/>use in specifying them now.</p><p></p><p>3.	That musical instruments may be of great use in religious
<lb/>edification—the tambour, triangles, sackbut, dulcimer, and big
<lb/>drum particularly.</p><p></p><p>4.	That good musical performances to a certain extent depend
<lb/>on the ability to read music at sight; but that it is not judicious
<lb/>to define that extent just now, nor just to omit saying that those
<lb/>who can read without their sight are to be accounted as among the
<lb/>most skilful.</p><p></p><p>5.	That the cultivation of secular music conduces to the ad-
<lb break="no"/>vancement of sacred music, just as far as it is kept secret, and its
<lb/>utility is in the inverse ratio to its prevalence.</p><p>6.	That some of the best ways of sustaining competent teachers
in our churches are to allow them their own way entirely in the
<pb n="232"/>
</p><p>tuition of classes—females especially—to give them good pay, and
<lb/>not allow them to chew honey dew, or drink gin slings, or Gough
<lb/>cordials, those beverages tending to injure the voice, and promote
<lb/>all manner of discords.</p><p></p><p>7.	Taat churches should hold themselves, and be held by others,
<lb/>as responsible lor the maintenance of their sacred music, accord-
<lb break="no"/>ing to the French proverb, “aide-toi et le ciel t’aidera.”</p><p></p><p>8.	That, popularly considered, the best means for diffusing musi-
<lb break="no"/>cal knowledge, is to persuade all persons who have the capacity to
<lb/>learn music, to develope the organs of time and tune, and issue
<lb/>testimonials, and give small premiums to those who excel in
<lb/>whistling, singing, or cleverly attempting to do either.</p><p>9.	That the principal advantage derivable from quartette choirs
is best known to those who have experienced it.
</p><p>10.	That churches are benefitted by religious music, as far as
<lb/>they themselves, as well as the music, are religious; which means,
<lb/>of course, the opposite of profane; and that if this does not always
<lb/>hold good, it is owing to some fault in the instrument, the voice, or
<lb/>faith of the performer.</p><p></p><p>11.	That the most excellent kind of melody is the melody of the
<lb/>heart; therefore, to effect this organ ought always to be a primary
<lb/>object of the singer or player, and that, in order to do this, it would
<lb/>be wise to write all semibreves, minims, crotchets, quavers, &amp;c.,
<lb/>heart-shaped instead of globular.</p><p></p><p>12.	That good musical taste is one thing, and religious influence
<lb/>another; therefore, as they are distinct, separate, but friendly ob-
<lb break="no"/>jects, they cannot in any shape or form conflict with each other.</p><p></p><p>13.	That the propriety of giving public concerts of sacred music
<lb/>in a great measure depends on the popularity of the practice, the
<lb/>cash receipts derivable from them, and the degree in which musi-
<lb break="no"/>cal professors acquire reputation and emolument by the practice.</p><p></p><p>14.	That the best mode of teaching religious music is for every
<lb/>person to learn it himself, but to be sure and pay the professor who
<lb/>lives by it.</p><p></p><p>The number of people present at the meetings during
<lb/>the “Musical Week,” might amount to (spectators inclu-
<lb break="no"/>ded) some eighty or ninety. The Convention threaten the
<lb/>city with another meeting in the ensuing year.</p><p>The Drama.
</p><p>Mr. Murdoch.—Our readers will recollect the com-
<lb break="no"/>mendation bestowed by us on certain Shakespearian re-
<lb break="no"/>citations at the Society Library in the spring of the pres-
<lb break="no"/>ent year. There were not a few persons of discrimina-
<lb break="no"/>tion and taste who discerned in their deliverer, Mr. Mur-
<lb break="no"/>doch, the elements and capabilities of a first rate per-
<lb break="no"/>former. Their faith will be dashed or confirmed by the
<lb/>results of next Tuesday evening, at the Park. Mr. Mur-
<lb break="no"/>doch on that occasion presents himself in Hamlet, and
<lb/>will contend for a position among the tragic actors of
<lb/>the day. In our judgment, while allowance being made
<lb/>for difference of years and opportunity, he will fall be-
<lb break="no"/>hind the greater names of his art, he will triumphantly
<lb/>overleap many performers who have borne the palm and
<lb/>made conquest of popular support.</p><p></p><p>We do not name names, but we shall be glad to see
<lb/>our American taking the field against all comers; we
<lb/>are satisfied, from what we know and have seen of the
<lb/>man, that he will acquit himself honorably. He appears
<lb/>at a period when the public are, so to speak, in expecta-
<lb break="no"/>tion: the tide has at length turned in favor of home tal-
<lb break="no"/>ent, and they are ready to welcome any one who may
<lb/>justify their national hope. Nationality at length steps
<lb/>forward to plant its standard in Literature, in Art, and on
<lb/>the Stage. Mr. Murdoch is destined to be one of its best
<lb/>and most resolute supporters. He comes at a time when
<lb/>he is needed. It is a long day since the American stage
<lb/>has presented to the public a native-born performer, whom</p><p></p><p>they could receive and adopt. Unless all augury derived
<lb/>from youth, person, voice, discipline and experience prove
<lb/>false, he is destined to become not only their child, but
<lb/>their favorite, and it will give us great pleasure to see
<lb/>him measured not only by the side of competitors, here-
<lb break="no"/>tofore, from abroad, hut keeping the field against all
<lb/>new-comers. We look for the prosperity of the drama
<lb/>here, at home. The hope of the drama is as great—great-
<lb break="no"/>er acording to our notion — here in New-York and in
<lb/>America than anywhere on the face of the globe; and we
<lb/>venture to predict that a school of dramatic writing, and
<lb/>a succession of performers, eminently national, having
<lb/>the color of the climate and the heart of the people in
<lb/>them, will ere long appear.</p><p></p><p>We look toward the drama, therefore, as a form in
<lb/>which the national spirit shall early show itself, with
<lb/>great anxiety. We are determined to watch its promise,
<lb/>and to give it every aid in our power. It is on this ac-
<lb break="no"/>count that we dwell on this first appearance of Mr. Mur-
<lb break="no"/>doch; and in his reception we expect to be furnished
<lb/>with an evidence and confirmation of our hopes. He pre-
<lb break="no"/>sents such claims, and has every circumstance that can
<lb/>attract and interest the public in his favor, so clearly on
<lb/>his side, that we are sure we cannot be mistaken in pre-
<lb break="no"/>dicting a reception in every way flattering to him, and
<lb/>honorable to American feeling and-pride of country.</p><p>Editorial Miscellany. 
</p><p>If any inference may be drawn from the constant is-
<lb break="no"/>sues of the press, poetry is ascending in America to a
<lb/>popular level. We have every week occasion to notice
<lb/>some new publication of this kind, on good paper, well
<lb/>bound, and altogether elegantly set forth. We have had
<lb/>or are to have within a very short time a sample from
<lb/>almost every one of the better known female writers of
<lb/>the country. Messrs Wiley &amp; Putnam are about to in-
<lb break="no"/>corporate poetical writings in their Library of Ameri-
<lb break="no"/>can Books. Paine &amp; Burgess, the new and spirited pub-
<lb break="no"/>lishers in John Street, are issuing a Miniature Edition of
<lb/>American Poets, in handsome style. Mr. Redfield has
<lb/>lately published a neat volume. Clarke Sc Austin are
<lb/>busy in the same direction—so that the opinion we have
<lb/>long entertained that poetry was destined to lift its fair
<lb/>front, next, in America, in new and attractive forms, will
<lb/>not be defeated by the absence of popular sympathy or
<lb/>a want of a disposition on the part of our publishers to
<lb/>further its approaches towards the public.</p><p></p><p>We have called attention under the Dramatic head, to
<lb/>the appearance of Mr. Murdoch at the Park Theatre,
<lb/>next week. To that occasion we again invite the atten-
<lb break="no"/>tion of our readers. The Drama is destined, we believe>
<lb/>to acquire a consequence in this country greater than it
<lb/>has enjoyed among any people since the ancient Gre-
<lb break="no"/>cians. We see on every side of us many indications of
<lb/>such a result. We are not sure but that the first form
<lb/>in which our Literature is to triumphantly vindicate it-
<lb break="no"/>self will be in that of dramatic writing. There will be
<lb/>and has been exceptions, in single productions in other
<lb/>departments: But we are not sure that the first school to
<lb/>rise will not be the dramatic. In the founding of such a
<lb/>school, good actors are as greatly needed as great writers:
<lb/>and it is on this account that we hope that every genu-
<lb break="no"/>ine American and well-wisher to the hopes of the coun-
<lb break="no"/>try, will sustain trials and attempts like this of Mr. Mur-
<lb break="no"/>dock.</p><p><pb n="233"/>

PUBLISH THIS DAY,
Elements of Morality and Polity.
BY PROF. WHEWELL.
THIS valuable new production, from the pen of
one of the most eminent scholars of the age,
</p><p>exhibits, in a most lucid, exact, and elegant state,
<lb/> the great principles of moral, political, and ecclcsi-
<lb break="no"/> slical science in a far more complete and methodi-
<lb break="no"/>cal manner than has ever yet been presented to the
<lb/> public. In offering this great work to the American
<lb/> reader, the publisher begs leave to introduce it as
<lb/>the commencement of a new and attractive series
<lb/>of sterling books, to be issued by them, under the
<lb/>general designation of</p><p>HARPER’S NEW MISCELLANY;
the volumes of winch will be legibly printed, in
duodecimo, on fine paper, and
Bound in extra Muslin Gilt—Price
Fifty Cents a Volume,
</p><p>land issued at short interval To render accessible
<lb/>to the million, the fullest advantage- of popular in-
<lb break="no"/>struction in the various divisions of human know-
<lb break="no"/>ledge, is the design of the above series. It is appa-
<lb break="no"/>rent in the present day, that books of intrinsic value
<lb/>are demanded by the people. Formerly the popu-
<lb break="no"/>lar taste preferred mainly works of mere amusement
<lb/>—the great body of readers now seek them as vehi-
<lb break="no"/>cles of general knowledge books of a more per-
<lb break="no"/>manently valuable caste—devoted to some of the
<lb/>departments of science, or general literature. A
<lb/>new race has sprung up, glowing with the first
<lb/>energies of youth, requiring more expanded ideas
<lb/>of the world in which they live, and a more reliable
<lb/>and well-digested knowledge of the men. and the
<lb/>events of other times and countries. A class of
<lb/>books expressly adapted to this demand, it is the
<lb/>aim of the publishers to supply; and at a price so
<lb/>exceedingly cheap that every person of ordinary
<lb/>taste and advantages may thus become possessed
<lb/>of a</p><p>Complete Library of the Best Litera-
ture of the Age.
</p><p>In this collection it is intended to include the best
<lb/>productions in every department of knowledge;
<lb/>| popular philosophical treatise- on topics of univer
<lb/>-sal interest; the most compact and brilliant histori-
<lb break="no"/>cal books; valuable biographical memoirs; modern
<lb/>voyages and travels, &amp;c.; together with scientific
<lb/>and other collateral divisions; in the selection of
<lb/>all which, the most careful discrimination will be
<lb/>observed A mere glance over the wide domain of
<lb/>our English literature will exhibit much yet unex-
<lb break="no"/>plored and uncultivated, from which might be ga-
<lb break="no"/>thered the fruits of a rich, luxuriant harvest; besides
<lb/>which, the ever-teeming issues of the European
<lb/>press open a vast revenue of literary wealth, from
<lb/>which the above collections may be liberally suppli-
<lb break="no"/>ed. Original productions from American writers
<lb/>I will also occasionally be introduced In submitting,
<lb/>therefore, the esteemed work of Prof. Whewell
<lb/> as a kind of first fruits of their ‘‘New Miscellany,”
<lb/>the publishers deem it only necessary to add, that
<lb/>their arrangements for carrying forward the enter-
<lb break="no"/>prise of being of the most complete and efficient kind,
<lb/>    they confidently rely upon their efforts being met
<lb/>with a ready response from the entire reading com-
<lb break="no"/>munity.</p><p></p><p>This, they venture to believe, will be insured to
<lb/>other Miscellany, no less from the intrinsic value
<lb/>of the collection, than from its unparalleled econo
<lb/>my: each volume being elegantly produced, bound</p><p>IN HANDSOME AND SUBSTANTIAL STYLE. FITTED WITH-
OUT FARTHER EXPENSE FOR PERMANENT PRESERVA-
</p><p>TION in the library; the whole series being issued
<lb/>in uniform binding while the price of each volume
<lb/>will be only Fifty Cents—far below the cost of

<lb/>or, it is believed, any other country.</p><p>PIANO FORTES.—THOMAS II. CHAMBERS,

J. F. BROWNE &amp; CO.
MANUFACTURER OF THE
IMPROVED PATENT DOUBLE-ACTION HARP,
By Royal Letters Patent, London. Established 1810. (Many years with Erard.
J F. BROWNE respectfully informs his Friends and the Musical World, that he has established himself for the manufacture
 and importation of  these very beautiful instruments, at
281 BROADWAY, and 73 1-2 CHAMBERS STREET.
His arrangements are such as to enable him to transact business at European prices, thereby saving purchasers the duties
imposed by Tariff on these Instruments.	
</p><p>J. F. Browne would observe these Harps are constructed on the most approved principles, with all the modern improvements of
<lb/>London and Paris, are unequalled in brilliancy of tone, fineness of touch, and perfectness of mechanism Particular care is taken
<lb/>to fit them for the extremes of climate in this country, in which respect they will be found far superior to any of European manufac-ture, imported in the usual way.	</p><p>These Harps are patronized by the elite of musical taste and professional talent in Europe; among the latter, he would mention
N.C. Boscha, who invariably selects from this establishment.
J. F. Browne begs to offer the opinions of some of the first professional talent in this country.
Mr. J. F. Browne, Sir:—Having had for several years past, the opportunity of making a professional use of your Harps, and of 	
</p><p>testing their qualities, it affords me pleasure to certify, that in point of tone, workmanship, and above all, a solidity that stands proof
<lb/>against the inconstancy of our trying climate, they have in all cases given me the most entire satisfaction.
<lb/>January, l845.	I am yours, CHARLES THIBAULT, No. 40 Beach St., N. Y.</p><p>Dear Sir:—I write to express the delight I experienced in performing on one of your Harps at Sig. Casella's Concert in this city.—
The mechanism is perfect, and the quality of Tone certainly superior to any harp I have heard for many years. I remember my old	
Master, Boscha, always gave the preference to your Harps, indeed he himself used no other.
Philadelphia, March 4th, 1841.		 Yours, most truly, H. G. TRUST.
 Mr. J. F. Browne, Sir:—I have much pleasure in saying, that the Harp of your make I performed on at the St. George's Society
 Concert, is, in brilliancy of tone, touch, and elegance of workmanship, the finest I ever  played on. This will apply to all your Harps.
The grand six and a half Gothic Double action, is a most splendid instrument. Yours, with respect, ELIZABETH  SLOMAN.
New York, January 16th, 1845.	
	A pupil of N. C. Boscha.
Mr. J. F. Browne, Sir Having at your request closely scrutinized your double-action Harps, I find they possess the best quali-	
ties of the first makers in Europe combined. That in the ease of touch by which the most brilliant tone is obtained in perfection and 
ease of modulation, they are superior to any I have used: their elegance of exterior must gratify the most refined taste. Your new 
Grand Gothic six and a half octave, is the most splendid effort of art yet produced in the musical world; it will give me great pleasure 
in recommending your Harps at every opportunity.	
January 12th, 1845.			Yours Truly, HENRY HORN.
                An eminent professor, and Member of the Royal Academy.
These are but a very small part of the testimonials received, but will suffice to show the estimate of persons every way capable of
making a correct decision. J.F. Browne has also received the Franklin Medal of the Society of Arts, Philadelphia, for his splendid 
 improvements in this delightful Instrument. 
Harps from 300 to 1000 dollars. Harps repaired, strings, &amp;c.
