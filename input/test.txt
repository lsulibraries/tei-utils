PORTRAITS.

Every year upon the opening of the exhibition, we hear
the senseless cry repeated from shallow-thoughted writers,
"too many portraits—who wants to see men’s faces—why
don't they give us more historical works?” as if historical
pictures were anything but groups of men’s faces. A portrait is 

to a historical composition what a biography is to history,
or a legend to a novel. For ourselves, we prefer portraiture
to historical compositions; and we regard a good portrait as
the very highest reach of art: and so does the world at large
regard it. The most valuable paintings in the world are por-
traits ; they sell at higher prices than any other pictures, and
give the highest degree of pleasure. Even the gross beauties

of Rubens are valued more highly than any other of his
paintings, and the portraits of Van Dyke and Titian are the
most esteemed of their productions. Take the portraits from
the list of Reynolds’ works, and there would be nothing left
worth having. Among our own painters, Copley, Stewart,
Trumbull, and Alston’s portraitures comprise the best and
most numerous of their productions. Perhaps the finest col-
lection of pictures in the country, is the Portrait Gallery of
Harvard College, which contains some of the finest of Cop-
ley’s and Stuart’s heads. A bad portrait of a bad subject
is certainly not a pleasant thing to contemplate ; but a fine
portrait of a fine head, is one of the most charming and pro-
fitable objects in Art. A portrait of Shakspeare by such an
artist as Van Dyke, would be worth more than all the histo-
rical pictures painted in his century. It is the true object of

Art to counterfeit Nature, and preserve the forms which
would be forever obliterated without its aid. We would by
no means discourage historical composition, but then we
would have each century paint its own history. It is very
obvious that no painter can give us a reflection of a past age.
We do not want mockeries in a picture, but realities. The
modest sculptures on the ruins of Palenque, give a more vivid
impression of the life of the Mexicans, than such pictures as
that by Mr. Rothermel in the present exhibition can do. The
two little pictures by Mr. Mount, numbers 145, 242, will
convey to our descendants a better idea of their ancestors,
than the most learned composition by one of themselves ever
can. If we must paint historical pictures, let us paint our
own history, which we thoroughly understand, and leave
the dead to paint themselves. We want no masquerades on
canvas, but living men and women in their real characters.

Our exhibition is rich in portraits, and particularly poor
in history pieces, which we are extremely happy to see; and
we draw more hopeful auguries for the Arts among us, than
if the case were reversed.

We miss from the walls of the Academy the perfect por-
traits of Page, which for many years were its chief glory in
portraiture. It is a puzzling anomaly that one of the great-
est artists in the country should be compelled to leave the
metropolis, and seek for employment in a provincial town.
But such is the truth, and a mortifying truth it is, for it
proves that there is a want of appreciation of the highest
order of talent in the community, or at least it seems to prove
it, for we do not believe that there is any lack of enthusiasm
for high Art, although fortuitous circumstances may some-
times defeat its manifestation.

New York has just cause to feel pride in her portrait pain-
ters, for she monopolizes nearly all the talent of the country
in this department of Art. And we doubt whether any school
in Europe can produce so large a number of good portrait
painters in the same number of artists.

We have already given the post of honor in The present
exhibition to Wenzler, a young German artist, who has here-
tofore given his attention to miniatures. The defect of his
portraits is their color, which is harmonious, but cold and
leaden. It must be owing, we think, to his painting in a
northern light. The portraits of Hugh Maxwell and Mr.
Furness are among the very best examples of portraits that
we have ever seen, but they are hung in a very bad position,
and it is not easy to pronounce very clearly upon their tech-
nical merits; yet they appear perfect in drawing, and only
lacking in a little warmth of tone. Next to these portraits
we must place No. 119, a portrait of Captain Erricsson, by
Elliott, a young artist, who exhibited his first picture, a por-
trait of Governor Seward, last year. Mr. Elliott is a native
of the western part of the State, Syracuse; he is destined to
occupy a very high position among the artists of the New
World. His great danger is facility of execution ; he paints
with great rapidity, and rarely or never fails in the like-
ness of his subject. The portrait of the celebrated engi-
neer is one of the most pleasing in the exhibition. We look
at it in vain, seeking for a fault, for it is very perfect in its
kind, harmonious in color, correct in drawing, free in execu-
tion, and altogether a most life-like, speaking portrait. We
are loth to qualify our praise, but it is the least degree in the
world sketchy. However, it gains in grace what it lacks in
solidity and finish. It is truly an admirable picture. No. 220,
a portrait of Horace Kneeland, is a stronger head and more
substantial, and quite as good as a likeness, but it lacks the
dignified repose indispensable in a portrait. No. 190, the
head of an old man with a flowing black beard, is an admi-
rable study, painted with surprising freedom and truth. No.
128, a Portrait of Mr. Spencer the artist, is a good sober pic-
ture. No. 200 is a sweet face—the position exceeding grace-
ful and unaffected. It is the least like a portrait, and the
most like nature, of any one in the room. It is a dewy rose,
compared with some of the artificial flowers near it.

No. 199. Portrait of T. Hicks—painted by himself. Law-
yers say that the advocate who pleads his own cause has a

fool for his client, and the artist who paints his own portrait
is sure of satisfying his sitter. Perhaps this is the reason
why artists are so fond of painting themselves. We believe
there are few painters who have not multiplied their own
faces. The Academy has an absurd rule, requiring its asso-
ciates to present their own portraits to he hung on its walls.
They could not have hit upon a better plan for securing a
collection of bad pictures. At the top of the great stairway,
as the visiter mounts into the sky-parlor, where, for some
inscrutable reason, the Academy holds its exhibitions, may
be seen the best collection of caricatures in the city. One
of the greatest curiosities among them is a head labelled
“Bryant,” which nobody would suspect was meant for the
poet of that name. Mr. Hicks's portrait, though painted by
himself, is very like him, but it is not equal to some of his
other portaits.

No. 23. Portrait of Col. Thayer—R. W. Weir, N. A. A
full length portrait in regimentals. The position is exceed-
ingly bad. A suspended action in a single figure produces a
very unpleasant sensation. The head is better painted than
any that we have seen by this artist before. The legs are
admirably foreshortened, but if they had been shortened still
more by being left off altogether, it would have been a bet-
ter picture. There cannot possibly be a more uninteresting
sight than a pair of long legs covered with white linen trow-
sers sticking out of a portrait. The accessories in this portrait
are finished with great care, but they are just the parts of
the picture which are of not the least consequence. It is the
only picture that Mr. Weir has in the exhibition.

No. 27. Portrait of Dr. Macready—J. J. Mapes, H. We
knew that Professor Mapes was master of an infinite variety
of accomplishments, but we were not prepared to see so good
a portrait as this from his easel. It is a speaking likeness.

No. 36. Portrait of a Child—J. H. Lazarus. A very sweet
picture, but it is so badly hung that it can hardly be seen to
advantage.

No 48. Portrait of D- Bryson—E. Mooney, N. A. A sober
truthful portrait. No. 55, W. Rowell, by the same artist, is
equally good. These pictures only lack a little warmth of
color to render them among the best in the exhibition. Their
coldness must be owing to the light in which the artist
works, for some of his portraits are almost hot in color.

No. 54. Portrait of Mrs. H. Shelton—F. Boyle. An ad-
mirable portrait; well drawn and well colored, excepting a
sooty hue which Mr. Boyle contrives to invest all his pictures
with. The position is graceful, the arms well disposed, and
the drapery elaborated with great care. Mr. Boyle is a
painter.

No. 67. Portrait of Captain Cropper—C. C. Ingham.
If Mr. Ingham will do himself the harm to paint portraits of
men, we hope for his own sake that he will eschew sailors.
He cannot put the rough externals of a weather-beaten face
upon canvass. 169 and 184, two portraits of young ladies,
are in his happiest manner. The shotted silk in 169 is a
miracle, and the gauze scarf might deceive one of Stuart’s
clerks. The ladies themselves appear to be made of finest
clay—porcelain.

No. 69. Portrait—E. H. May. This young artist has two
other portraits in the exhibition ; the best of the three, and
indeed among the best portraits in the room, is No. 130; it is
altogether a most admirable portrait, modest, substantial,
and fleshly.

No. 83. Brig. Gen. Roumfort, of the Second Brigade,
Philadelphia.—W. E. Winn. We are very happy to per-
ceive that this is a production of the right-angled city. Why
it was sent here for exhibition we are at a loss to conceive.
Gen. Roumfort may be a brave man and good citizen, for
aught we know to the contrary, but the artist appears to
have tried hard to make him look like the reverse. Not
content with giving him all the swagger possible, he has
made the gallant General’s sword several inches longer
than its scabbard. It is a woful picture, and it brings to
mind most woful events, which the Philadelphians should be
ambitious to forget.

No. 158. Portrait of a Gentleman.—T. H. Smith. There
is nothing in this modest picture, excepting the marked
character of the subject, to attract attention, and the posi-
tion in which it is hung not being a favorable one. we should
hardly have noticed it had we not known the painter to be
one of the most industrious, most enthusiastic, and most-

promising of all our young artists. No. 221, another head of
an old gentleman, is a very truthful, unpretending portrait.

No. 165. A Greek.—By F. Fink. This portrait attracts a
good deal of attention, and is universally admired. The
hands are exquisitely painted, and the whole picture reflects
great credit on the artist. But it is not the portrait of a
Greek ; it is a gentleman in a greek costume, and so it should
have been called.

No. 172. Portrait of Jacob Barker.—By H. Inman, N. A.
This is the only portrait by this gentleman in the exhibi-
tion ; but this is one of the best that he has ever painted. It
is a good likeness and a very pleasing picture. Considering
that it was painted from three sittings, and those short ones,
it must be regarded among this distinguished artist happiest
efforts. It is somewhat slight and sketchy, but we see that
it is just what the artist aims at in painting. The resem-
blance of the head to the portraits of Doctor Franklin is very
remarkable.

Bust of J. J. Mapes. By H. Kneeland. It is to the disadvan-
tage of this excellent bust that it is the only one in the exhibi-
tion, for it is so true to nature, so finely and purely model-
ed that it requires to be seen by the side of ordinary works
to make its superiority apparent. It is admirably chiseled,
and makes the nearest approach to the perfection of Power’s
busts of any that we have seen in any previous exhibition.
There are many portraits still left of real merit which we
shall notice hereafter.

		HORUS.

ON WRITING FOR THE MAGAZINES.

Before the days of magazines, wit and mirth, and quibs
and jests, and glorious outbursts of temperament, must have
lost half their relish without the after enjoyment of being
produced in the magazines—if indeed they could ever exist
in any conversational perfection without the suggestions and
stimulus of the press. It is notorious now-a-days, or if not,
it may be very readily observed that men talk to write, and
write to talk—that the mutual collision of the babble of the
club room and the soiree with the silence of the writing ta-
ble, broken only by the music of the pen on paper, makes
them perfect in both. One never talks with any knowledge
till he writes, travelling into the secret labyrinths of thought,
or writes with feeling till he has been warmed by the coun-
tenance and sympathy of the living eye and voice. Our ante-
magazinists had none of this; they left few records to their
children of their swift passing moments; they appeared only
in state, on special occasions in print, and handed down his-
tory to us as little better than a Parish Register.

Negligence and ease, with enthusiasm and refinement, are
the charms of a magazine. No one should care what a
writer is deficient in, for this purpose, if he only excite our
sympathy and awaken our enjoyment. Who is the prince of
the magazinists but Christopher North, the careless slipshod
enthusiast, a glowing Sun breaking upon us all the brighter
out of the polar austerities of Scotland ? It was a merciful
dispensation which sent this tropical genius to a clime
which might naturally produce only Chamber’s Journals and

Information for the people. Soul, soul, soul are the three
requisites for the great magazine. We like the dishabille
air and demi-toilette of authorship, for we feel, where these
are worn, the surrounding atmosphere is warm and genial.
Here we prefer sensibility to sense. Political economy may
take care of the pocket elsewhere, and the didactic play on
some other instrument of its own. Our organ should
breathe only the heart-stirring symphonies of Beethoven.
We would have one shelf or more in our library for solid
Encyclopedias and books of business, and another distinct
 where the eye may catch the golden lettering of the poets,

and those prose legers of the heart where the best affections
are entered up monthly, and an open account kept against
Time to the end. What a good round balance there will be
in favor of John Wilson, Leigh Hunt, and Thomas Hood for
instance, when three score and ten brings its settlement!

It will be seen that we restrict the magazine article pro-
per to but one species of writing, or rather one way of think-
ing or feeling, for the illustrations of the faculty may be va-
rious, ranging through all the wide world of fancy, humor,

pathos, not forbidding satire—for satire, when it is not pure-
ly malevolent, may be enjoyable, bringing us into closer com-
panionship with our fellows. The rough points of a satirist’s
temperament may be the cog-wheels which link us in more
closely with the general movement from which we might
else be separated and unhappy.

Above all things the magazine must depend upon its inte-
rest to us for its contemporary matter. It must talk of the
day and the hour, the whim or philosophy of the moment,
it must be immediate and local. It must discourse readily
upon the fashionable notoriety of the time, or read its homily
for the benefit of the newest politician, or satirize the latest
folly, and turn round to put us in conceit again with its con-
veniences and virtues. Its great aim is to make us pleased
with the world as it is, its praise must be the very otto of
egotism and complacency, its “ feigned abuse such as per-
plexed lovers use.” It should purify the soiled temple of the
world, by causing us to forget all the evil and reminding us
of all the good, removing the mildew of weariness and dis-
gust from its shrines and altars, that the spirit may return
and worship again pure and undismayed. Life would some-
times pall upon us, were it not relieved by the playful graces
of the essayist. In this day no one can be insensible to the
benefits of literature. The most heroic act is incomplete till
it receive the welcome, the All Hail! of the orator and poet.
Fame dwells in books. The guardian being wanting, the
virtue becomes extinct. If the magazines had more power it
would be better for the state. We know not what cultiva-
tion our statesmen, for instance, might receive if their mea-
sures were ably reviewed by faithful writers, and their
speeches commented upon by a body of critics who would
be the protectors of manly eloquence. No one will long
waste intellect where it is unheeded. “ Do not use fulmina-
ting gold when common gunpowder will do the same,” wrote
Moore to Leigh Hunt, when Moore thought his friend wus
writing too well in the pages of the Reflector. Our politi-
cians are in little danger of resorting to such a costly alchy-
my. It is different abroad. Pulic men approach the public
with the fear of the press before their eyes. An English de-
bater rounds his periods by the music of the eloquent Times
or Examiner, as by the flute of Gracchus. Our orators, with
no such clarifying medium, speak direct to Bunkum. It is
by the support and influence of the best men that the best
things are done, the best words spoken, and the best books
written. Pope has explained this in his courtly graceful

way:

“ But why then publish? Granville the polite,

And knowing Walsh, would tell me I could write ;
Well-natured Garth inflamed with early praise,

And Congreve lov’d, and Swift endur’d my lays!

The courtly Talbot, Somers, Sheffield read,

E'en mitred Rochester would nod the head,

And St. John’s self, great Dryden’s friend before,

With open arms receive one poet more.”

There is nothing more delightful in authorship, than an
unchecked genial strain of friendly altercation, a rivalry in
the appreciation of one another’s qualities, where it takes
place between men who possess something in themselves
worth eulogizing, and are of sufficient importance for the
world to take an interest in the matter. We know what a
much dreaded word egotism is in society and among critics,
and how instinctively alarm is taken by a class of very sensi-
tive persons at the slightest approach to personality; how

292

THE BROADWAY JOURNAL.

many very careful guardians there are in the world with the
zeal of duennas, whose prudish, nicely-educated souls are of-
fended at an improper exhibition of self, and we appreciate
very kindly the good taste which would reduce men and wo-
men to a vapid state of insipidity, by closing the mouths of
everybody to anything which might prove hazardous to the
personal comfort of—fools. Yet in spite of all this, we are
advocates of plain speaking, downright thinking, egotism,
personality, and any other terror “within the limits of be-
coming mirth,” and guarded by a never to be relinquished
spirit of honest dealing. So long as fair play is shown, let
us have the game out, come the good or ill fortune of it
where it may.

One large class of objectors to the egotism of authors is
that numerous body who are not authors, and who some-
times affect to be superior to the supposed vanity which,
they imagine, is at the bottom of these exhibitions in print.
Let us look into the matter. Waiving, for a moment, all
questions of the kind of notoriety, in the case of the author,
it may be, as it very often is, that the name of a fault-finder,
if he be a merchant, for instance, is a hundred times in the
paper to the author’s once. The most greedy, carnivorous
candidate for fame, who bites with the avidity of a pike at a
newspaper puff, and urges his literary wares upon the pub-
lic, amid the general laughter, and particular contempt of
his own class, is not half so industrious as the tradesman
with his signs, bill-heads, check-books, agencies, correspon-
dences, runners, gazetteers, advertisements, with his name
on every packing box, placarded on every dead wall, running
about the streets on carts, labelled on sloops, making the
tour of rivers on steamboats, from the broad bunting to the
very plates and dishes in cabin, and the last pewter spoon,
or reaching that apotheosis of reputation, the figure head
and bow of a ship ploughing the ocean. A prolific literary
rabbit keeps before the people with some diligence, but not
with half the success of the last pill manufacturer. But, it
will be said, the fact is nothing, the motive is everything.
The merchant pursues notoriety purely as an affair of busi-
ness, of dollar and cents, and, when these are attained, his
own private character, his domestic interests, his heart and
soul, are his own uncorrupted, while the author is making
trade and merchandize of all that a man should hold most
dear and secret, of his affections, his sensibilities, the pre-
tended goodness of his heart, and nicety of his feelings. Is
the merchant so entirely uncorrupted as he represents him-
self? Is there nothing involved in his notoriety-seeking but
matters of interest and profit ? Is it all outward, material,
separable from the man ? No, his good name stands for a
thousand things besides his dollars and cents. Go into the
interior of the country, and see the fluttering which the pre-
sence of a man whose name has stood a quarter of a century,
with honor, in Pearl Street, creates. He may be courted for
his wealth, but he is respected for all that stands behind it,
the probity, the self-denial, the industry, the talent, the en-
ergy, which have made him celebrated. Is name, is notori-
ety nothing? Why, without any impeachment to his mo-
desty, he goes up to the desk of the hotel, and writes his
autograph, in the traveller’s book, with the air of a man
drawing a check on the spectators for an unlimited amount
of respect, attention and deference, with the certainty of its
being honored. The merchant seeks notoriety for the same
ends, and as nearly as he can, with the same means as the
author. Talk not of the vanity of authors, and the love of
puffs and notoriety, ye merchants, before editors. As sooth-
ing to the soul of the ship-owner in South st., or the Captain
on the seas, is a few inches of type, eulogistically arranged,
as to the glistening eyes of the most self-idolatrous youngster,
who ever perpetrated rhyme or prose.

We see that the merchant, in his own argument, does not
stand quite clear of the suspicions he urges against the au-
thor. He is very righteously and commendably strengthen-
ing his own convictions and deference to duty by the voice
of public opinion. And he is by no means necessarily mak-
ing sale of his virtues, because he is prosperous by the credit
he gets for them. The author assuredly goes further in the
voluntary exhibition of himself,—in his egotism,—to admit
the point at once. It is his vocation. To find fault with
him for this is to beg the whole question. It is his business
to write out what he knows, thinks and feels, that other men
may learn to know, think and feel. If he were to do other-
wise, and cease to exhibit, directly or indirectly, his own
personal character on the page, biography would soon be an

enumeration of mere platitudes, and would fall into the very
pretence and puffery sought to be avoided; ignorance would
be unquestioned, folly respected, and vice unscathed ; there
would be one biographical formula, something like that in
the ladies’ magazines, where character and reputation are
dispensed as freely as tin money on the stage, where genius,
that century-blooming aloe, blooms as rankly as the "dande-
lion in the field, and Shakspeares and Miltons go staggering
about in bibs and petticoats. What a blessed uniformity of
praise there would be !—what charity, what kind-hearted-
ness!—how perfect a Utopia, how benevolent a Millennium,
if heroes of various kinds could have it all their own way,
unchallenged by the occasional impertinence of interfering
sensibility and justice. What is genius but this secret
spring of egotism, everywhere giving life to books as the
water to the landscape which is sometimes hidden deep be-
neath the surface, at others half concealed by foliage, then
playing, laughing and rejoicing in a thousand streams and
rivulets in the full blaze of day ? Egotism will be valued al-
ways in proportion to the character of the author, as a soil
that betrays a vein of gold is worth more than one of coal or
slate. That it may become a nuisance, is undoubted; but
in its annoying forms, it carries its own antidote in its very
barefacedness. But even in its coarser and common forms,
it has its value, as in the autobiography of Benvenuto Celli-
ni, while no passages of the great authors are treasured
more than those in which they pause, parenthetically, to
convey some allusion to themselves. Who would lose the
supposed personal reference to the blind bard in Homer, or
the passage on Light in Milton ? and, in spite of what is
generally said to the contrary, who does not fancy Shaks-
peare, probably with justice, a thousand times interposing
his own sentiments ?

We have certainly " fetched a compass” to get to our port
of magazine writing, and vindicate its personalities. Are
not our American writers, lecturers, preachers, politicians,
editors, actors and other publicans, enough talked about ? It
may be that they are too much talked about, and too little
—that their names are better known than their actions—that
they are often heard of, but poorly understood. We want
the niceties of knowledge: all is nothing, mere barrenness,
till we find out or are taught the peculiar secret principle
which constitutes their vitality. We do not know anything
of the men till we know that. We must have a niche for
our writers, in the gallery of the mind, otherwise they are
so much lumber thrown together at the threshold. No man’s
knowledge is to be valued till he offers you something of his
own, which is not to be picked up on the highway, or to
which has been added some value from use or keeping. We
get this rarely. Every one knows everything about our pub-
lic men, few know anything. How little of all that has
been written can we refer a stranger visiting the country to
for a keen, just, appreciative character of our worthies!
The magazines should be looked to for its criticism. Here
is a field where the genuine writers of the country should
come to one another’s help, and not leave the best charac-
ters of our authors and statesmen, as is the fact at present,
to be written abroad. If we wish to learn anything of our
great men, beyond, of course, the fact that they are great,
we must go to Miss Martineau and the foreign reviews.

Authors have always been a generous body of men to one
another in dedications, compliments, reviews, &c., and there
is nothing more graceful or valuable than these things, when
they are conscientiously bestowed by good and true men.
The old scholarship of the Continent, the verses prefixed to
the Elizabethan editions, the tributes in the writings of
Hazlitt and his friends, are so many well remembered in-
stances among others. It was a peculiarity of the old Eng-
lish authors—insomuch that Leigh Hunt in his new work on
Imagination and Fancy, has gone somewhat at length and
apologetically into the matter, in reference to Shakspeare,
who mentions none of his contemporaries. “ Has any body,’’
says he, “discovered the reason why he never noticed a liv-
ing contemporary, and but one who was dead ? and this too,
in an age of great men, and when they were in the habit of
acknowledging the pretensions of one another.”

How necessary this spirit of appreciation is among others,
where literature is an affair sustained and defended by the
few, is a point only to be suggested. In the present state of
our literature it is of the next importance to being true to
themselves, that literary men should be true to one another.
Short as our history has been, and comparatively few as

AURORA AGRICULTURAL INSTITUTE.

A circular has been issued by several gentlemen of this County,
for the establishment of an Institute at Aurora, in which young men
may become thoroughly acquainted with “the principles of Agricul-
tural Science, and their application to Practical Husbandry."
The plan is one which received the fullest approval of the late Judge
Buel; and the arrangements made, are such as cannot fail to offer
every desirable inducement to those interested. The farm chosen
consists 212 acres, adjoining the beautiful village of Aurora, which is
well fitted by soil, location, improvement, &c., for such purpose. No
pupils under 14 years of age received. Charles C. Young, A. M. is
Proprietor and principal; A. Thompson, A. M., M. D. Lecturer on
Botany, Geology, Agricultural Chemistry, &c., and David Thomas,
Visitor and Adviser.—Auburn Journal.

Some of our readers may smile at seeing the announce-
ment of an “Agricultural Institute” made the subject of an
article in the “Broadway Journal,” but we trust that those
who have had their eyes filled with the dust of Broadway
since the breath of Spring has swept our streets, (the only
sweeping by the way that they get,) will pardon us if we
carry their mind's eyes to the contemplation of green fields
and budding flowers. We are not without precedent, too,
for introducing rustic themes even into “Broadway,” for
which we cite the display of huge squashes and mammoth
turnips at Niblo’s Saloon every autumn, to say nothing of
that learned body of citizens called “The Farmer’s Club,”
who meet weekly in the Park to discuss soils and fertiliz-
ing powders.

Our readers must not suppose that we intend to cut Broad-
way ; we have no such cruel design. We confess too much
attachment to city life, to its libraries, and lectures, its soci-
eties of learned men and its social advantages; we are not
yet tired of even coal fires and gas lights; we still love to
contemplate the various phases of human nature only to be
found in a large city. Yet with all this admiration for the
“town,” we are troubled at times with the “spring fever.”

No sooner does the Battery become green, or the trees in
the Park unfold their leaves, than we feel an instinctive long-
ing to look at the country. We yearn to pluck the first hya-
cinth of the garden, the earliest blue violet of the field, or
the first trilium erectum of the woods. We attribute this in-
clination to the fact of our having spent some portion of our
early life in the country, a pleasure which we sincerely wish
many of the young people we meet in our walks could enjoy,
while their hearts are fresh, and their tastes unformed by
the conventional standards of town life.

It is not our purpose to discourse at length on the impor-
tance of an institute founded on the plan above stated its
benefits to our youth, and especially to the young men of our
cities, must be apparent to all. Farming, as a learned pro-
fession, (we mean a profession that requires learning,) is be-
coming more and more popular; as an accomplishment, it is
likely soon to become fashionable, and we think the sooner
the better ; as an occupation, it has charms and advantages
to which no other pursuit can lay claim.

A well ordered school of Agriculture, we conceive to be a
great desideratum; and we are pleased to see public atten-
tion directed to the subject. The day seems to have gone
by, when education consisted only in learning words, and the
whole youthful life must be spent on a form, torturing the
brain and destroying the body. It has been discovered that
physical as well as mental training is necessary to the full
development of our nature. The philosophy of Socrates and
Plato—the philosophy of words has long since given way to
the philosophy of Bacon—the philosophy of works.

To those boys who have for years been poring over dull
pages of Greek and Latin, whose eyes have become weak
and weary with much study—whose brains have been puz-
zled with irregular verbs and heathen Mythology, and their

bodies enervated by the confinement of the school-room,____

how delightful must be the change, to the pure fresh air of
the fields and the invigorating labor of practical husbandry.

The situation of the Aurora Institute is peculiarly favora-
ble to the objects for which it is established. The eastern
bank of the Cayuga Lake, the site of the beautiful village of
Aurora, is in the centre of the famous wheat growing dis-
trict of this State ; for beauty of scenery, fertility of soil, and
salubrity of climate it is not surpassed by any section of our
country.

In the capacity of Visitor and Adviser, this institute will
have the services of one of the most competent men in the
State. There are many men better known to the public
than David Thomas, but none more esteemed by the large
number of scientific men who rejoice in his acquaintance.
Well versed in the natural sciences, and peculiarly gifted
with the faculty of imparting his knowledge to others, he is
most fitly chosen for his office.

Whatever advantages this institution may possess, none
will be more truly appreciated by the youth who resort thith-
er, than the society and instruction of this learned and good
man.

THREE SUNDAYS IN A WEEK.

“You hard-hearted, dunder-headed, obstinate, rusty,
crusty, musty, fusty, old savage !” said I in fancy, one after-
noon, to my grand uncle Rumgudgeon—shaking my fist at
him in imagination.

Only in imagination. The fact is, some trivial discrepan-
cy did exist, just then, between what I said and what I had
not the courage to say—between what I did and what I had
half a mind to do.

The old porpoise, as I opened the drawing-room door,
was sitting with his feet upon the mantel-piece, and a bum-
per of port in his paw, making strenuous efforts to ac-
complish the ditty,

Remplis ton verre vide !

Vide ton verre plein !

“My dear uncle,” said I, closing the door gently, and ap-
proaching him with the blandest of smiles, “you are always
so very kind and considerate, and have evinced your benevo-
lence in so many—so very many ways—that—that I feel I
have only to suggest this little point to you once more to
make sure of your full acquiescence.”

“ Hem!” said he, “ good boy ! go on !”

“ I am sure, my dearest uncle [you confounded old rascal!]
that you have no design really, seriously, to oppose my union
with Kate. This is merely a joke of yours, I know—ha! ha!
ha !—how very pleasant vou are at times.”

“ Ha! ha ! ha !” said he, “ curse you ! yes!”

“ To be sure—of course ! I knew you were jesting. Now,
uncle, all that Kate and myself wish at present, is that you
would oblige us with your advice as—as regards the time—
you know, uncle—in short, when will it be most convenient
for yourself, that the wedding shall—shall—come off, you
know?”

“ Come off, you scoundrel!—what do you mean by that ?
Better wait till it goes on.”

Ha ! ba! ha !—he ! he! he!— hi! hi! hi!—ho! ho! ho !—
hu!hu!hu!—oh, that’s good!—oh, that’s capital—such a
wit! But all we want, just now, you know, uncle, is that
you would indicate the time precisely.”

“Ah !—precisely ?”

“ Yes, uncle—that is, if it would be quite agreeable to

yourself.”

 “ Would’nt it answer, Bobby, if I were to leave it at ran-
dom—some time within a year or so, for example ?—must I

say precisely ?”

“If you please, uncle—precisely.-

“Well, then, Bobby, my boy—you’re a fine fellow, are’nt

294

THE BROADWAY JOURNAL.

you ?—since you will have the exact time, I’ll—why, I’ll
oblige you for once.”

“ Dear uncle !”

“Hush, sir!” [drowning my voice]—“I’ll oblige you for
once. You shall have my consent—and the plum, we mus’nt
forget the plum—let me see ! when shall it be ? To-day’s
Sunday—is’nt it? Well, then, you shall be married precise-
ly—precisely, now mind!—when three Sundays come toge-
ther in a week ! Do you hear me, sir! What are you gaping
at ? I say, you shall have Kate and her plum when three
Sundays come together in a week—but not till then—you
young scapegrace—not till then, if I die for it. You know
me—I’m a man of my word—now be off!” Here he swal-
lowed his bumper of port, while I rushed from the room in
despair.

A very “fine old English gentleman," was my grand-
uncle Rumgudgeon, but unlike him of the song, he had his
weak points. He was a little, pursy, pompous, passionate,
semicircular somebody, with a red nose, a thick scull, a long
pur e, and a strong sense of his own consequence. With the
best heart in the world, he contrived, through a predominant
whim of contradiction, to earn for himself, among those who
only knew him superficially, the character of a curmudgeon.
Like many excellent people, he seemed possessed with a
spirit of tantalization, which might easily, at a casual glance,
have been mistaken for malevolence. To every request, a
positive " No!” was his immediate answer ; but in the end—
in the long, long end—there were exceedingly few requests
which he refused. Against all attacks upon his purse he
made the most sturdy defence; but the amount extorted from
him, at last was, generally, in direct ratio with the length of
the siege and the stubbornness of the resistance. In charity
no one gave more liberally or with a worse grace.

For the fine arts, and especially for the belles lettres he
entertained a profound contempt. With this he had been in-
spired by Casimir Perier, whose pert little query “ A quoi un
poete est il bon?" he was in the habit of quoting, with a very
droll pronunciation, as the ne plus ultra of logical wit. Thus
my own inkling for the Muses had excited his entire dis-
pleasure. He assured me one day, when I asked him for a
new copy of Horace, that the translation of “ Poeta nascitur
non fit"  was a nasty poet for nothing fit”—a remark which
I took in high dudgeon. His repugnance to “ the humani-
ties had, also, much increased of late, by an accidental bias
in favor of what he supposed to be natural science. Some-
body had accosted him in the street, mistaking him for no
less a personage than Doctor Dubble L. Dee, the lecturer
upon quack physics. This set him off at a tangent; and just
at the epoch of this story—for story it is getting to be after
all—my grand uncle Rumgudgeon was accessible and paci-
fic only upon points which happened to chime in with the
caprioles of the hobby he was riding. For the rest, he laugh-
ed with his arms and legs, and his politics were stubborn and
easily understood. He thought, with Horsley, that “the
people have nothing to do with the laws but to obey them."

I had lived with the old gentleman all my life. My pa-
rents, in dying, had bequeathed me to him as a rich legacy.
I believe the old villain loved me as his own child—nearly
if not quite as well as he loved Kate—but it was a dog’s ex-
istence that he led me, after all. From my first year until
my fifth, he obliged me with very regular Hoggings. From
five to fifteen, he threatened me, hourly, with the House of
Correction. From fifteen to twenty, not a day passed in
which he did not promise to cut me off with a shilling. I
was a sad dog, it is true—but then it was a part of my na-
ture—a point of my faith. In Kate, however, I had a firm
friend, and I knew it. She was a good girl, and told me
very sweetly that I might have her (plum and all) whenever
I could badger my grand uncle Rumgudgeon, into the neces-
sary consent. Poor girl!—she was barely fifteen, and with-
out this consent, her little amount in the funds was not come-
at-able until five immeasurable summers had “dragged their
slow length along.” What, then, to do? At fifteen, or even
at twenty-one [for 1 had now passed my fifth olympiad] five
years in prospect are very much the same as five hundred.
In vain we besieged the old gentleman with importunities.
Here was a piece de resistance (as Messieurs Ude and Ca-
reme would say) which suited his perverse fancy to a T. It
would have stirred the indignation of Job himself, to see how
much like an old mouser he behaved to us two poor wretch-
ed little mice. In his heart he wished for nothing more ar-
dently than our union. He had made up his mind to this

all along. In fact, he would have given ten thousand pounds
from his own pocket (Kate’s plum was her own) if he could
have invented anything like an excuse for complying with
our very natural wishes. But then we had been so impru-
dent as to broach the subject ourselves. Not to oppose it
under such circumstances, I sincerely believe was not in his
power.

I have said already that he had his weak points; but, in
speaking of these, I must not be understood as referring to
his obstinacy: that was one of his strong points—“assure-
ment ce n’etait pas sa foible.” When I mention his weakness
I have allusion to a bizarre old-womanish superstition which
beset him. He was great in dreams, portents, et id genus
omne of rigmarole. He was excessively punctilious, too, upon
small points of honor, and, after his own fashion, was a man
of his word, beyond doubt. This was, in fact, one of his
hobbies. The spirit of his vows he made no scruple of set-
ting at naught, but the letter was a bond inviolable. Now
it was this latter peculiarity in his disposition, of which
Kate’s ingenuity enabled us, one fine day, not long after our
interview in the dining room, to lake a very unexpected ad-
vantage ; and, having thus, in the fashion of all modern bards
and orators, exhausted, in prolegomena, all the time at my
command, and nearly all the room at my disposal, I will sum
up in a few words what constitutes the whole pith of the
story.

It happened then—so the Fates ordered it—that among
the naval acquaintances of my betrothed, were two gentle-
men who had just set foot upon the shores of England, after
a year’s absence, each, in foreign travel. In company with
these gentlemen, my cousin and I preconcertedly, paid uncle
Rumgudgeon a visit on the afternoon of Sunday, October the
tenth—just three weeks after the memorable decision which
had so cruelly defeated our hopes. For about half an hour
the conversation ran upon ordinary topics; but at last, we
contrived, quite naturally, to give it the following turn:
Capt. Pratt. “Well, I have been absent just one year.—
Just one year to-day,as I live—let me see! yes!—this is Oc-
tober the tenth. You remember, Mr. Rumgudgeon, I called,
this day year, to bid you good-bye. And by the way, it does
seem something like a coincidence, does it not—that our
friend Captain Smitherton, here, has been absent exactly a
year also—a year to-day ?”

Smitherton. “Yes! just one year to a fraction. You will
remember, Mr. Rumgudgeon, that I called with Capt. Pratol
on this very day, last year, to pay my parting respects.”
Uncle. “Yes, yes, yes—I remember it very well—very
queer, indeed ! Both of you gone just one year. A very strange
coincidence, indeed ! Just what Doctor Dubble L. Dee would
denominate an extraordinary concurrence of events. Doctor
Dub—”

Kate. (Interrupting.) “ To be sure, papa, it is something
strange; but then Captain Pratt and Captain Smitherton
didn’t go alttogether the same route, and that makes a
difference, you know.”

Uncle. “I don’t know any such thing, you huzzey ! How
should I ? I think it only makes the matter more remarkable.
Doctor Dubble L. Dee”—

Kate. “Why, papa, Captain Pratt went round Cape Horn,
and Captain Smitherton doubled the Cape of Good Hope.”
Uncle. “ Precisely !—the one went east and the other went
west, you jade, and they both have gone quite round the
world. By the bye, Doctor Dubble L. Dee"—

Myself, (hurriedly.) “ Captain Pratt, you must come and
spend the evening with us to-morrow—you and Smitherton—
you can tell us all about your voyage, and we’ll have a game
of whist, and”—

Pratt. “Whist, my dear fellow—you forget. To-morrow
will be Sunday. Some other evening’’—

Kale. “Oh no, fie !—Robert’s not quite so bad as that.
To-day's Sunday.”

Uncle. “To be sure—to be sure !’’

Pratt. “ I beg both your pardon’s—but I can’t be so much
mistaken. I know to-morrow's Sunday because”—

Smitherton, (much surprised.) “What are you all think-
ing about? Was’nt yesterday Sunday, I should like to
know ?”

All. “ Yesterday, indeed ! you are out."

Unde. “ To-day’a Sunday, I say—don't I know ?’’

Pratt. Oh no !—to-morrow's Sunday.”

Smitherton. “ You are all mad—every one of you. I am

as positive that yesterday was Sunday as I am that I sit upon
this chair.”

Kate, (jumping up eagerly.) “I see it—I see it all. Papa,
this is a judgment upon you, about—about you know what.
Let me alone, and I’ll explain it all in a minute. It’s a very
simple thing, indeed. Captain Smitherton says that yester-
day was Sunday: so it was; he is right. Cousin Bobby, and
uncle and I, say that to-day is Sunday: so it is; we are right.
Captain Pratt maintains that to-morrow will be Sunday; so
it will ; he is right too. The fact is, we are all right, and
thus three Sundays have come together in a week."

Smitherton, (after a pause.) “By the bye, Pratt, Kate has
us completely. What fools we two are! Mr. Rumgudgeon,
the matter stands thus: the earth, you know, is twenty-four
thousand miles in circumference. Now this globed the earth
turns upon its own axis—revolves—spins round—these
twenty-four thousand miles of extent, going from west to
east, in precisely twenty-four hours. Do you understand,
Mr. Rumgudgeon ?”

Uncle. “ To be sure—to be sure—Doctor Dub”—

Smitherton, (drowning his voice.) “Well, sir: that is at
the rate of one thousand miles per hour. Now suppose that
I sail from this position a thousand miles east. Of course, I
anticipate the rising of the sun here at London, by just one
hour. I see the sun rise one hour before you do. Proceed-
ing, in the same direction, yet another thousand miles, I an-
ticipate the rising by two hours—another thousand, and I
anticipate it by three hours—and so on, until I go entirely
round the globe, and back to this spot, when, having gone
twenty-four thousand miles east, I anticipate the rising of
the London sun by no less than twenty-four hours; that is to
say, I am a day in advance of your time. Understand, eh ?"

Uncle. “ But Dubble L. Dee”—	.

Smitherton, (speaking very loud.) “Captain Pratt, on
the contrary, when he had sailed a thousand miles west of
this position, was an hour, and when he had sailed twenty-
four thousand miles west, was twenty-four hours, or one day,
behind the time at London. Thus, with me, yesterday was
Sunday—thus, with you, to-day is Sunday—and thus, with
Pratt, to-morrow will be Sunday. And what is more, Mr.
Rumgudgeon, it is positively clear that we are all right; for
there can be no philosophical reason assigned why the idea
of one of us should have preference over that of the other.

Uncle. “ My eyes !—well, Kate—well, Bobby !—this is
a judgment upon me, as you say. But I am a man of my
word— mark that! you shall have her, boy (plum and all,)
when you please. Done up, by Jove ! Three Sundays all in
a row! I’ll go,and take Dubble L. Dee’s opinion upon that.

TO ONE IN PARADISE.

Thou wast all that to me, love,

For which my soul did pine—

A green isle in the sea, love,

A fountain and a shrine,

All wreathed with fairy fruits and flowers,

And all the flowers were mine.

Ah, dream too bright to last!

Ah, starry Hope ! that didst arise
But to be overcast!

A voice from out the Future cries,

"On ! on !”—but o’er the Past

(Dim gulf!) my spirit hovering lies
Mute, motionless, aghast!

For, alas! alas ! with me
The light of Life is o’er!

(Such language holds the solemn sea
To the sands upon the shore)

Shall bloom the thunder-blasted tree,

Or the stricken eagle soar!

And all my days are trances,

And all my nightly dreams 

Are where thy dark eye glances,

And where thy footstep gleams—

In what ethereal dances,

By what eternal streams.

REVIEWS.

The first Three Books of Homer’s Iliad, according to the Ordi-
dinary Text, and also with the restoration of the Digamma, to
which are appended English Notes, critical and explanatory, a
Metrical Index, and Homer’s Glossary. By Charles Anthon,
L.L. D., Jay Professor of the Greek and Latin Languages in Colum-
bia College, New York, and Rector of the Grammar School. New
York: Harper & Brothers.

This is one of the series of “School and College Classics”
which have attracted so general an attention, first, from their
comprehensiveness, and admirable adaptation to their ob-
jects, and, secondly from their punctilious accuracy and beau-
ty of typographical execution. We have seen richer, gaudier,
but never more truly beautiful books. The Greek text, in
this Homer, with the frequent digammas, is certainly the
most graceful and picturesque specimen of printing we ever
beheld.

The volume contains all of the Iliad which is usually read
at school, as preparatory to a collegiate course—sufficient
to furnish the student with the principles of Homeric trans-
lation and analysis. The text is, in the main, that of Spitz-
ner, which is now generally regarded as the best;—although
on some occasions, alterations have been adopted, and the
reasons given in a note. Besides the regular text of Spitzner,
there is that of Richard Payne Knight, with the digamma
restored according to his views. In fact, it is by no means
improbable that this secondary text is at least a close ap-
proximation to the ancient orthography of Homer—although
many discrepancies might be pointed out, going to show that
in many cases the learned commentator could not have been
otherwise than wrong in his conjectures. The work of
Knight is extremely rare in this country, and even as a mere
matter of curious speculation, Dr. Anthon has rendered a
public service by introducing the restorations in question.

The commentary, as in all this series of classics, is pecu-
liarly full and explicit—proceeding on the sole ground which
is admissible in matters of scholastic instruction—the ground
that the scholar is absolutely ignorant, and has need of infor-
mation at all points, however seemingly trivial. No error is
more fatal in tuition, than that of taking it for granted that
the student knows any thing at all. The materials of the
Notes are derived, chiefly, from Wolf, Heyne, Buttman, Na-
gelsbach, and Stadelmann, and the Commentary includes
every thing that is really valuable in the works of these
eminent scholars. The Glossary is separated from the Notes,

 - a very judicious arrangement—and contains a great deal

of novel information in regard to the parsing of the Homeric
Greek. It is distinguished, also, from every Homeric Lexicon
which has preceded it (in English) by its introduction and
application to the Homeric text, of the Sanscrit and Lin-
guistic Etymologies:—an Index to the Glossary is subjoined.
The Metrical Index has been constructed with especial refer-
ence to the doctrine of the digamma and its bearing upon
the Homeric versification.

Upon the whole, this edition of Homer is not only one of
the most valuable of the series, but one of the most impor-
tant additions to classical literature which this country or
any other has produced.

Letters from New York. Second Series. By L. M. Child. New
York. C. S. Francis, & Co. 1845.

The great popularity of the first series of Mrs. Child’s let-
ters from New York, will insure a hearty welcome and a
large sale for this new volume. Without possessing any of
the charms which private epistles derive from their confi-
dential revelations and bits of private scandal that all peo-
ple love, the letters of Mrs. Child make a direct appeal to

every human heart and cause the reader to feel as though
they had been addressed to himself personally. It is because
the author opens her own heart that she gains admission to
the hearts of others so rapidly. Nothing will so disarm re-
serve as confidence; ice can alone be melted by heat; hatred
and anger must be overcome by love and kindness. Bitter,
sarcastic writers can never hope for popularity, or at least
love. We rarely see one of Swift’s essays carried about as a
pocket companion, but the good natured genial writings of
Goldsmith are oftener bound up as pocket volumes than the
works of any other author. The popularity of Mrs. Child’s
letters must be attributed to a similar cause ; and to the fact
that they treat of human beings and things that interest hu-
manity. The sympathies of men are more wide than we
are apt to believe. The stories of washerwomen, of street-
sweepers and little beggar children, interest us beyond the
most elaborate histories of merely official personages. Mrs.
Child instinctively seizes upon subjects which are interesting
to all classes, to men and women rather than to statesmen,
or ladies and gentlemen. The present volume of her letters
has a most taking table of contents. 'Christmas,’ 'Ole Bul,’

'New Year’s Festivities,’ 'Valentine’s Day,’ 'Fourth of July,’

'Children in Union Park,’ 'Genius and Skill,’ ‘Greenwood
Cemetery,’ 'The Violin,’ 'Autumn Woods,’ The Spirite of
Trade,’ 'Sir Harry Falkland;’ these are some of the titles
to the letters ; suggestive of charming reading and delight-
ful heart-touching subjects.

We make an extract from the last letter.

Rapid approximation to the European style of living is more and
more observable in this city. The number of servants in livery visi-
bly increases every season. Foreign artistic upholsterers assert that
there will soon be more houses in New York furnished according to
the fortune and taste of noblemen, than there are either in Paris or
London ; and this prophesy may well be believed, when the (act
is considered that it is already not very uncommon to order furniture
for a single room, at the cost of ten thousand dollars. There would
be no reason to regret this lavishness, if the convenience and beauty
of social environment were really increased in proportion to the ex-

penditure, and if there were a progressive tendency to equality in the
distribution. But, alas, a few moments’ walk from saloons superbly
furnished in the style of Louis 14th, brings us to Loafer’s Hall, a
dreary desolate apartment, where shivering little urchins pay a cent
apiece, for the privilege of keeping out of watchmen’s hands, by
sleeping on boards ranged in tiers.

But the effects of a luxurious and artificial life are sad enough on
those who indulge in it, without seeking for painful contrast among 
the wretchedly poor. Sallow complexions, feeble steps, and crooked
spines, already show an obvious deterioration in beauty, grace, and j
vigor. Spiritual bloom and elasticity are still more injured by modes 
of life untrue to nature. The characters of women suffer more than j
those of men, because their resources are fewer. Very many things 
are considered unfeminine to be done, and of those duties which are
feminine by universal consent, few are deemed genteel by the upper
classes. It is not genteel for mothers to wash and dress their own
children, or make their clothing, or teach them, or romp with them
in the open air. Thus the most beautiful and blessed of all human
relations performs but half its healthy and renovating mission. The
full, free, joyful growth of heart and soul is everywhere impeded by 
artificial constraint, and nature has her fountains covered by vanity 
and pride. Some human souls, finding themselves fenced within such
narrow limits by false relations, seek fashionable distinction, or the
excitement of gossip, flirtation, and perpetual change, because they
can find no other unforbidden outlets for the irrepressible activity of
mind and heart. A very few, of nature’s noblest and strongest,
quietly throw off the weight that presses on them, and lend a com-
paratively true life in the midst of shams, which they reprove only
by example. Those who can do this, without complaint or noise,
and attempt no defence of their peculiar course, except the daily
beauty of their actions, will work out their freedom at last, in the
most artificial society that was ever constructed ; but the power to
do this requires a rare combination of natural qualifier. For the few
who do accomplish this difficult task, I even feel more respect than
I do for those who struggle upward under the heavy burden of early
poverty. “For wealth bears heavier on talent, than poverty. Under
gold mountains and thrones, who knows how many a spiritual giant
may lie crushed down and buried?” I once saw a burdock shoot up
so vigorously, that it threw off a piece of board in the platform,
which covered it front light and air. I had great respect for the brave
plant, and even carried my sympathy so far, as to reproach myself
for not haring lifted the board it was trying to bard to raise, instead
of watching it curiously, to see how much it could do. The pressure
of artificial life, I cannot take off from souls that are born in the
midst of it; and few have within themselves such uplifting life as the
burdock.

It is one of the saddest sights to see a young girl, born of wealthy

and wordly parents, full of heart and soul, her kindly impulses con-
tinually checked by etiquette, her noble energies repressed by gen-
teel limitations. She must not presume to love any body, till father
and mother find a suitable match ; she must not laugh loud because it
is vulgar ; she must not walk fast because it is ungenteel; she must
not work in the garden, for fear the sun and wind may injure her
complexion; she must sew nothing but gossamer, lest it mar the
delicacy of her hands ; she must not study, because gentlemen do
not admire literary ladies. Thus left without ennobling objects of
interest, the feelings and energies are usually concentrated on frivo-
lous and unsatisfactory pursuits, and woman becomes a by-word and
a jest, for her giddy vanity, her love of dress and beaux.

The Pencil of Nature. By H. Fox Talbot: London, 1844. Imported

by Wiley & Putnam, 161 Broadway. Nos. 1 and 2.

This is the first attempt to publish a series of pictures, made
entirely by Nature herself. They are produced by the pho-
tographic process, and are of course as true, excepting in co-
lor, as truth herself. These reflections of Nature are fixed
upon sensitive paper instead of metal plates, as in the Da-
guerrian process; and each picture is an original work. The
“Pencil of Nature” is a somewhat fanciful term, and not a
very correct one, for these impressions partake of the charac-
ter of a medallion more than of painting. But we are not
disposed to pick differences about terms, the work itself is
entitled to the highest consideration, and every one who in-
spects it will draw his own auguries of its influence on the
imitative Arts. The author gives a very full and lucid state-
ment of the first discovery of his art, and of the process by
which it has been carried to its present high condition. By
pure chance, Monsieur Daguerre has reaped nearly all the
honors of the discovery which Mr. Fox Talbot made simul-
taneously with him. There are twelve plates in the two
numbers of Mr. Talbot’s publication, which very satisfacto-
rily prove the importance of the art in giving actual views of
almost any kind of still life. In making copies of architectu-
ral ornaments and pictures, it must be found of very great
advantage; and even in copying curious manuscripts and rare
old books, it is found of great service, as may be seen from
a fac-simile of a page of an old Norman-French book, con-
taining the statutes of Richard the Second.

The view on the Boulevard at Parts, taken from one of the
upper windows of the Hotel de Douvres on the corner of the
Rue de la Paix, is a most delightful picture which transports
the spectator in a visit to the French Capital. It has noth-
ing of the doubtful aspect or indistinctness of a painting, but
is indeed. Paris itself. The street has just been watered and
is under repair, as seen by a couple of wheel-barrows
which stand in the fore ground. By the road side a row of
Cittadines and Cabriolets are waiting, and a carriage is stand-
ing in the distance. It is the Broadway, as much as this is
Broadway which we look into when we raise our head.
But, goodness, what a range of fantastic chimney-pipes bor-
ders the horizon, forest of flues of all conceivable shapes.
The corner house on the right hand is a bathing house, with
"Bains” painted on the wall. Saving the mansion with a
railing in front it looks for all the world like a New York
house; we can look into the garret window and almost dis-
cern a Grisette at her employment. It is a cheap view of
Paris.

The most charming of all the impressions however is the
reflection of an English haystack, which brings us an English
market scene as truly as though we were looking out of an
English window upon an English farm-yard. The sunshine
which falls upon it is English sun-shine; it has lighted up
an object three thousand miles away, and now shines as
brightly on our desk as it did a year ago in Somersetshire,
or in pleasant Kent, for the locality of the haystack is not
given. The book itself, considered merely as a book, is a
rare specimen of luxurious publishing, and the ornament on
the cover is worth to an ornamental artist, for a study, more
than its contents

Saul, A Mystery. By the Author of “Christian Ballads,” "Athan-

asion,” etc. etc. etc. New York : D. Appleton, & Co.

This poem was announced as about to be published in the
fall of 1842, but withheld for private reasons. It is the lon-
gest dramatic work ever written, we believe, by an Ameri-
can,—occupying more than 280 pages, large duodecimo. The
history on which it is founded, is contained in the Books of
Samuel, commencing with the twentieth chapter of the first
book, and ending with the first chapter of the second. “It
may be proper to say," says the author in a note, "that I am
not acquainted with any other poem in the language plotted

on the same incidents. Mr. Sotheby’s Epic, which very
probably occupies the same ground, I believe I have never
seen, and am sure that I never read.”

This we look upon as a very remarkable thing. How a
poet, writing a Jong dramatic poem on the same theme, and
with the same title and hero which have been already employ-
ed by another, could have forborne (at least after the comple-
tion of his own work) to peruse the work of his fellow-la-
borer in the field, is to our apprehension, we say, a eery re-
markable thing, and plainly shows Mr. Coxe to be a very re-
markable man.

We have no faith in dramatic poems—they are paradoxical.
What is poetical is not dramatic—what is dramatic is never
poetical. “Saul,” however, is not entitled a “Dramatic
Poem,” but a “ Mystery”—and if there is any thing in the
World we detest, it is a mystery of any kind. We confess,
therefore, that we proceed to the perusal of this book with
a host of prejudice. We do not think we shall like it, and
if we do not, we shall endeavor to say so, in the plainest of
all possible terms.

In our next " Journal,” we shall review the poem in full.
At present, we have time only to extract a peculiar passage,—
the whole of the first scene of the fourth act.

Merodach. There crashed an avalanche,

From highest Libanus:

And ho ! another falls a-near,

Glancing a thousand moonbeams,

As the crystal rocks of ice,

Go thundering down below.

And hark! it is the mother-eagle screams,

As snaps the high branched pine,

And her nest and her brood are buried.

Far, far, in the valley below,

The peasant awakes in fear,

As he hears the alarum on high,

And the booming destruction comes down !

He wakes, and he prayeth his prayers;

The prayers that he prayeth are vain.

A mountain is piled on his roof and his home,

And the cry, and the crashing are still.

(Climbs higher.)

Earth, in these solitudes,

Makes bold to talk with God,

And lifts her head sublime to heaven,

Where breaks no mortal voice
On the long Sabbath of her quietness.

But spirits, where are ye
In icy fetters pining;

Ye who once chained the soul of Saul;

Ye whom the harp disarmed,

When David rallied his good angels,

To drag ye hither through the viewless ?
Spirits, say where !

(Pauses.)

If such the might of song;

Ye too shall have enchanters
Mimicking once more
The spell of Moses’ rod:

And Pytho shall be praised upon the lyre,

Loud as the Hebrew’s Lord.

A blind old man shall be
To roam the sunny islands,

That float upon the sea,

And on their hills, and on their valleys,

Forever, shall his song enshrine
A fair idolatry.

(Climbs higher.)

Enchantress hear'st me not,

That calledst me afar?

I come to bid the spirits back again,

And seven beside, more strong.

Their harper foe is gone forever,

And Saul is thine once more.

Say witch, where art thou ?

Come on !

Merodach.	Ah, Magdiel, art thou there ?

Voice. Ay, teaching the new seven. Did ye hear

The snowballs that we bowled upon your head?

Never too Late. By Charles Burdett. New York. D. Appleton, & Co. Be-

ing of a second series of tales for the people.

One of those simple little tales of every day life, written to enforce a
pious lesson, which always proves popular, and is doubtless found
conducive to the object aimed at. Mr. Burdett is already favorably
known as the author of two or three other books of the same class.
It is published in a neat style, uniform with the well known “ series of
for the people," issued by the same publishers.

THE MAGAZINES.

The Knickerbocker.

Democratic Review.

Hunt’s Merchant’s Magazine.

American Review and Whig Magazine.—(Colton.)

The Knickerbocker presents its customary variety in its
table of contents besides a grand piece de resistance, com-
posed of A. Pike, and its Editor’s table the usual variety of
pleasant gossip. We are sorry to see that Mr. Clark has in-
volved himself in a quarrel with Mr. Hudson, and more so
that he should have found anything in our own columns that
by transplanting will wear an appearance of hostility to that
gentleman. Our remarks, which the Editor of the Knick-
erbocker has quoted, were meant to apply solely to Mr.
Hudson’s manner, and not to his matter, for we had not
heard enough of his lectures to enable us to form an opinion
of his views of his subject; but we were strongly impressed
with a feeling of respect for Mr. Hudson’s opinions, from the
little that we did hear.

The feature of the Democratic Review is an essay on
education by Mr. Hudson, from which the public may form
a correct idea of his style and thoughts. Many who have
long been in the habit of calling all New-Englanders reform-
ers and transcendentalists, will be struck with his strong Con-
servatism. Mr. Hudson has constantly an eye to the
future, like the majority of his countrymen, but he also keeps
an eye fixed steadily upon the past. He believes in the good
old times. The Democratic has several admirable articles
besides Mr. Hudson’s. The Essayist on English letter writers
from the time of Howell to Lamb, makes a very singular
omission in leaving Horace Walpole out of his Catalogue.
This is like leaving Shakspeare out of the list of English
Dramatists, or Fielding from the Catalogue of Novelists.
Walpole is the only Englishman whose letters form the
circulating portion of his works. We read the letters of other
authors on account of their other productions : but we read
Walpole’s works, because we have read his letters. We
have extracted a good part of the Essay on writing for the
Magazines, for its genial humor and magazinity, into ano-
ther part of our columns. The portrait of the Democratic for
this month is a striking likeness of McDuffie, of South Caro-
lina, copied from a daguerreotype.

Hunt's Magazine has a translation from M. Coquelin,
by Henry C. Carey, of Philadelphia, on the Commercial
Associations of France and England, a paper on the Erie
Canal Enlargement, by J. B. Jervis, of New-York, on the
Corn Trade of the United Stales, by Charles Hudson, of
Massachusetts, a review of the Exploring Expedition, and
a great amount of of statistical matter.

The American Review, Mr. Colton's Whig Magazine,
is almost a duplicate of the Democratic Review excepting
the complexion of its politics. The first article, by Dr.
Bacon “ The Mystery of Iniquity,” is forcibly written, and
infinitely more exciting than any of the ‘mysteries’, not 

excepting Saul, that have recently been published. It reads

very much like a chapter from the mysteries of Paris. The
paper by Mr. Hudson “on reading” will do very well as a Se-
qaul to one on Education in the Democratic. It is worth

an infinite number of such Essays as that by Pycroft, a cheap
edition of which has recently been published. The review
of the ‘ Vestiges of Creation,’ is the most vigorous attack
that has yet been made on that much abused and much be-
praised work. The embellishment of the Whig Review, is

a portrait of John Quincy Adams, neither very commenda-
ble as a portrait or as a work of art. The biographi-
cal sketch of the old-man-eloquent, as the country news-
papers will persist in calling the venerable ex-President,
contains an extract from his diary when he was twenty-five

years old, which will let him down in the eyes of good

people several rounds on the ladder of fame.

    Taking them together, these four works exhibit a higher

reach in the department of magazine literature, than the
country has ever offered before. While the three dollar
magazine, cheap and flashy, flourish best in Philadelphia,

the five dollar ones thrive best in New York ; indeed it is
the only place, except Richmond, Va., where one has ever

thrived at all. But there is still room for another to administer

to tastes and preserve interests, which the others neglect.
No magazine in this country has yet done anything for the
interests of art, but there is a growing appetite in tne Ameri-
can people for works of artistic excellence, which we trust
that some intelligent publisher will before long turn to a
profitable account.

Blackwood.—Mess. Leonard, Scott & Co. have issued the April
number of Blackwood. It cont .ins eight papers of varied excellence,
but all good. “ Ping-Kee’s view of the stage” is piquant exceeding,
ly, and North’s Account of Dryden (although disfigured with the usu-
al carelessness and rant of Wilson) is an admirable essay. The con-
tinuation of the papers called “ Confessions of an Opium Eater” is
better, we think, than the original—which was a lie throughout.
There is yet room for a book on opium eating, which shall be the
most profoundly interesting volume ever penned. It would be written,
however, by no De Quincy.

EOTHEN

The editor of the Buffalo Journal has started an ingenious
thought in respect to this brilliant book of travel, which will
not in the smallest degree diminish its value, even though
his thought should prove a fact. He thinks that Eothen was
composed upon the plan of the Amber Witch and Lady Wil-,
loughby’s Diary, and that the success of the former work led
to the composition of Eothen. We copy a part of his re-;
marks, which are certainly very plausible.

We are more than half inclined to suspect that the success of the
Amber Witch has provoked the really clever writer of Eothen to test,
by a like experiment, the boasted infallibility of the English Review-
ers. Sparkling as most of the sketches in Eothen are, there is not
from beginning to end a single passage that could not have been writ-
ten by a man of vivid imagination—such as the writer evidently pos-
sesses__without removing from his library. Hundreds of writers of

works, avowedly fictitious, display quite as much of graphic fidelity
to nature in describing scenery, costumes and manners, with which
they have no other acquaintance than through books.

The reader of Eothen will note that the author carefully avoids all
ticklish ground, and never ventures upon any description the fidelity
of which can be tested by actual observation. Thus his journey from
Belgrade to Constantinople, his residence in that city, his visit to the
plain of Troy, his description of Smyrna, &c., although specimens of
very beautiful writing, are yet so vague, shadowy, and indistinct, that
of the thousands who have visited the same places none can say that
this is true, this false, except in the general way that every well read
man can make the same averment—We see the writer and read his
reflections, but we see nothing of the East.

His visit to Lady Hester Stanhope is described with more particular-
ity of detail, for the reason that on such a theme the writer felt him-
self on safe ground. Lady Hester is dead, and so cannot contradict
any statement he may make, and besides, she was so eccentric, saw
so few travellers, and her mood so changed from time to time, that
the writer of Eothen might let his fancy run riot in description, and

none could convict him of fiction. His adventures in Palestine, with

descriptions of what he saw, could easily have been made up from
books, and the hints derived from the conversation of friends who
had actually visited the Holy Land. The whole of that portion looks
like patch-work, made brilliant by the glow of a fervid imagination.

But we are willing to stake the whole argument on the chapter of
“Cairo and the Plague.’' If any one can read that and verily believe
the writer ever witnessed and passed through what he professes, he
need not stagger at any thing. The same is true of what he says
respecting the Pyramids, and that incredible, solitary ride on a drome-

dary, in the night, across the desert, to Suez.—Look, too, at Baalbec,
despatched, literally, in a dozen lines of dreamy mystification, con-
taining not one definite idea. We might go on with particulars, but
these are enough to direct inquiry to the point we wish. The mock-
ing tone in which much of the book is written, gives piquancy to it,
while at the same time it suggests that the wicked writer was chuck-
ling over the success of his scheme to mystify the Aristarchuses of the
reviews. The view we have taken of the book in no way detracts from
its literary merits, which are of a very high order; but what fun it
will be to the writer to have so effectually mystified the erudite, elabo-
rate, and solemn Quarterly, the keen, critical acumen of Blackwood,
and the very respectable reading public generally ? We should like
to have the opinions of our critical friends of the Mirror and the Broad-
way Journal upon this matter.

If the travels of Bruce, published with his own name, and
accompanied by numerous original drawings of the objects
that he saw in his journeyings, were looked upon as apocry-
phal, it would not be a strange matter if a book like Eothen,
which has been published anonymously, should be regarded
as a fiction. But its authenticity has never been doubted in
England, where the author must be well known. Its author-
ship has been attributed to a barrister named Trevilian, and
we have no doubt that it is a perfectly true book. The beau-
ty of the style, the light-hearted novelesque manner of the
narrative, and the absence of such statistical matter as we
generally find in books of travel, all help to give it an air of
romance. But these are just the points which a good artist,
like the author of Eothen, would have regarded, and to make
his book appear true, he would have introduced some of the
characteristics of other true books ; as the author of the Am-
ber Witch has done. But its originality is one of the strong-
est evidences of its genuineness. Nothing could be more
easy than to get up, without leaving one’s library, a book of
Eastern travel that would thoroughly deceive the public ; but
only a very great artist could have hit upon the novel idea
of practising a deception by framing a work unlike any other
that had ever appeared on the same subject, and instead of
using the same materials which others had brought from
the east, to reject them altogether. But it would be impos-
sible for the author to take his reader to a region which he
had never visited himself. Eothen brings the east to us
more vividly than any other eastern traveller has done ; such
spots as Baalbec are hurriedly and dreamily sketched, be-
cause other travellers had described them minutely. There
is a minuteness of honesty in many parts of Eothen, which
appears exceedingly like the work of an ingenious artist ra-
ther than the effect of an ingenuous mind ; but they are few,
and the marks of sincerity and honesty are many. We read
the work with entire faith, satisfied that if the author were
not a true traveller, he was in the highest degree a true
artist.	____________________

BOBUS SMITH.

It is not generally known to American readers, that the Rev. Syd-
ney Smith had a brother who was nearly as bright a genius as the
great wit himself. Robert Smith, commonly called Bobus by his
friends, died just a fortnight after the decease of his elder and more fa-
mous brother. We find the following biographical notice in the last
number of the London Critic, the new weekly review which defends the
cause of Young England ;

“It has very recently fallen to our lot to attempt some com-
memoration of the life, character, and genius of the late Rev.
Sydney Smith. We little apprehended at the time that we
should so soon afterwards be called upon to record the death
of his brother, elder by one year, Robert Smith, Esq., which
took place on the day fortnight after the other. These two
| most remarkable men had always entertained a strong degree
| of reciprocal attachment and admiration for each other; but
the life of the elder had, especially of late years, been so com-
paratively withdrawn from the more prominent scenes of
business and society, that we have little doubt that we shall
surprise the larger proportion of our readers by affirming that,
while the younger justly attracted an ampler share of the
public notice by the more active part he bore in questions

and measures affecting the public welfare, and while in a 
species of inspiration which he imparted to mirth and wit, 
though by no means his most valuable characteristic, he, 
among the men of his own, and perhaps of any time, may 
with truth be pronounced inimitable; at the same time, we 
believe that the most discerning of the contemporaries who 
were happy enough to enjoy the friendship of both—we are 
sure that the lamented Sydney himself—would in extent of 
acquirement, in original force of thought, in mastery of mind,
have given the palm to Robert, or to call him by the name 
he inherited from the happy familiarity of early days, Bobus 
Smith.

“We cannot pretend to give a full or accurate account of his
life. He was born iu 1770. At Eton he was the intimate 
associate of Canning, Frere, and Lord Holland, and a contri-
butor to the Microcosm. At Cambridge he materially added 
to the reputation for scholarship and classical composition
which he had established at school; and if the most fastidi-
ous critic of our day would diligently peruse the three
Triposes which he composed in Lucretian rhythm, on the
three systems of Plato, Descartes, and Newton, we believe 
that we should not run the least risk of incurring the charge
of exaggeration, in declaring our belief that these composi-
tions in Latin verse have not been excelled since Latin was 
a living language. Be this said with the peace of Milton and
Cowley—with the peace of his fellow Etonians, Grey and
Lord Wellesley.

“We are not aware that we can refer to any subsequent
compositien by Mr. Smith which could be put on a level with
these youthful effusions. We should, indeed, imagine that
no person with his powers of intellect had ever published so
little. Nor were his achievements in active public life, from
the same fastidious aversion to display, though by no means 
wanting in usefulness, at all commensurate with the ideas
conceived of him by every one that approached him. He was
nine years in Bengal as Advocate General, and one short ex-
tract from Sir James Macintosh’s Diary may show the value
entertained for him there:—“I hear frequently of Bobus; al-
ways merry and always kind. Long live Bobus !”	

We believe his acquaintances were disposed to form bril-
liant auguries of what he was likely to effect as a speaker in
Parliament. His first essay, in 1812, is supposed not to have
come up at least to the mark of his own fastidious judgment,
and he seldom afterwards addressed the House at any length,
or upon subjects which excited the contest and passions of
parties. He rendered, however, really eminent services as
a most diligent and pains-taking member of committees,
which might have put many an idle mediocrity to the blush.
He finally retired from Parliament in 1826. He spent the re-
mainder of his life in comparative retirement, in the serene
enjoyment of the various literature he loved, and the cheer-
ful intercourse of the restricted society that delighted him.
Nothing can be imagined more rich and racy in its variety
of material, and in its force of reflection, than his conversa-
tion. “ Pourquoi ne parlez-vous comme-ca dans la Cham-
bre des Communes?" said Madame de Stael to him one day,
after listening for some time to its eloquent flow; though
there was in it nothing of the harangue, in its manly ease
and simplicity it partook of his character; there was much
in him of the sturdy Saxon combined with the refined and
thoroughly finished scholar. No one was ever so clear of all
frippery, and the only thing for which he probably felt no
toleration was a prig. Of his conversation Mr. Canning said
“Bobus's language is the essence of English.”

In his inner domestic life he was full of gentle and attach-
ing qualities. He married Caroline Vernon, daughter of
Richard Vernon, esq. and Evelyn, Countess of Upper Ossory.
He lost a son and a daughter in their prime of youth, each of
most rare promise. His eldest son, and only surviving
child, is the Right Hon. R. Vernon Smith, M. P. for North-
ampton.

Professor Gouraud.—The following extract from the
Professor's lecture on Memory, is a remarkable instance of
fluent writing in a foreigner, who, three or four years since,
was almost ignorant of our languge. M. Gouraud’s style
is somewhat too luxuriant for these days of classic severity,
but it has wonderful ease as the production of a foreigner.

Already have the birds of night, preceded by the white-winged owl,
who seems to serve them as a warning beacon, begun to regain their
obscure retreats in the shadowy depths of the forests: the timid hare



and cautious deer have already left the open fields for the more propi-

tious shadow of the woods. At their return, the implacable eagle and
the voracious hawk begin to prepare anew their sharp talons for the
morning’s hunt; while, disengaging their heads from underneath the
warm wings which covered them during the night, the birds of day
among whom they must soon choose again their prey, little foreseeing
the cruel fate which may and which must before long overtake them,
open their eyes, shuffle their glossy feathers, and begin to hop from
branch to branch, as if to stretch their little limbs, and prepare their
light wings for flight.	

All at once, the air rings with a melodious sound, which causes the
atmosphere to vibrate afar, with a sweet and tremulous thrill; the
echo, hitherto silent, repeats it in successive adulations to the distant
streamlet of the valley. Immediately cadencing a harmonious rou-
lade, which seems to run over a thousand varied notes at once the
fairy voice which produced these ravishing sounds awakens all the
surrounding echoes, and they repeat it in chorus—while the voice itself
seems to pause, as if, submerged in the torrent of harmonies with
which she has filled the atmosphere, she were listening to herself in
rapturous astonishment. At these enchanting accents, the joyous
troop are suddenly arrested, as if under the infatuation of a spell to
listen also; for they have recognised the harmonious ringing notes of
the lyric enchantress of the groves, the morning leader of the song-
sters of the forest—the melodious nightingale ! who, already prelu-
ding at her morning concerts, offers thus abruptly her first salutations
to Aurora, always attentive to her songs. It would seem indeed that
her melodious notes had been carried by the surrounding echoes even
to the carminated gates of the horizon, and were understood by the
elements; for Aurora at the moment seems to have redoubled her
pace. The birds, preluding already to the harmonies of their matin
hymns, seem to prepare themselves for singing her triumphs. At
their head is the rustic cuckoo, the gay linnet, the lively red-breast
and the sensitive turtle-dove. The nightingale by their side, presiding
t over the concert, redoubles her harmonious cadences, as the Goddess
of the dawn approaches. Most of the stars have vanished from the
firmament; the heavens now appear like an ocean of shining gold and
liquid gems of a thousand hues. And now Aurora reigns in undisputed
sovereignty. But, alas! “ a natural image of pleasure: as nothing is
more beautiful than her reign, so nothing is shorter than its duration.”

The god of day follows her with hasty steps ; she must soon resign
her empire, like the night, which just now fled so rapidly before her.
 In vain the hours, with redoubled energy, scatter in precipitated floods

their bouquets of roses beneath her steps; she must finally yield—the

god of day has almost overtaken her ! Already he is announced by
the more vivid tints which he pours around him. The glowing rays
but just precede the dazzling glare; the east seems on fire : it appears
suddenly all in flames. At their effulgency, the burning disc is each
moment expected ; at every instant he seems about to appear—at last
he rises majestically from the liquid abyss! A brilliant pencil of
flame, starting forth like a flash of lightning, and suddenly filling all
space, seems, like the bow of a celestial orchestra, to have given the
last signal for the awakening of all nature. It is the Sun, who has

just touched upon the horizon with the edge of his inflamed disc.—

Red as a purpuereal sphere of gleaming Vermillion, and at first of an
immense size, he gradually ascends from behind a wide-spreading
curtain of clouds, which he soon pierces with a thousand pencils of
light, forming a gigantic glory, whose superior rays curve themselves
into an immense arch, which reaches to the zenith. “ Then the veil
of darkness being entirely effaced, man is again permitted to recog-
nise his abode, which he finds everywhere beautified and embellished.
The verdure has taken during the night fresh vigor and renewed fresh-
ness ; the new-born day which shines upon it, the first rays which gild
it display it covered with a brilliant net-work of dew, which reflects
to the eye the light and the colors of the rainbow !”

The merry troop is again arrested to contemplate with ecstatic feel-
ings the glorious spectacle, which has been thus gradually developed
before them. Meanwhile all nature has been awakened, at that sub-
lime moment,—when the disc of the sun touched lightly upon the
horizon—the birds were re-united in chorus, and now they cause all
the echoes of their melodious warblings to resound in concert. Not
one remains silent; their musical songs, feeble at first, are more ten-
der and sweet than during the remainder of the day—they seem as if

tinged with the softness and mellow ness of a languid awakening.—

Imitating their merry concerts, the insects hum beneath the grass ;
the fishes in the streams dart along the surface of the water, and leap
with jov, sparkling in the light with their silver scales; the reptiles
crawl from their dark and humid holes, and come to bask in the warm
sun-light ; and even the serpent himself, raising up his hideous head
above his spiral coils, and darting out his scarlet longue, unable to sing
praises hisses forth bis ceaseless curse ! Every thing, finally, is exci-
ted and moved throughout all nature; every thing breathes joy and
happiness at the first rays of the rising Sun—and the planets them-
selves do they not bound forward in their empyreal course more
rapidly and more animatedly as they approach him nearer and nearer

But to speak only of things more accessible to the observer; at
his appearance the camel of the desert is said to kneel while turning
himself towards the east; the eagle stretches broad his extended
wings, while fixing his piercing eye upon his burning disc ; and the
elephant salutes him with his flexible proboscis: or rather, do not
all the animals salute in his image, by an irresistible impulse, in this
universal concert and by these testimonials of respect and gladness,
HIM of whom the Sun is but the shadow ?-the universal Father and
Benefactor, above all empyreal suns ! And yet, “ although the con-
course of all these objects carries to the sense an impression of fresh-
ness which seems to penetrate even to the soul,” man alone, of all
created beings, almost always forgets himself in presence of a spec-

tacle so majestic and sublime! . . . . . . .	

Soon the laborers resume their wonted toils; the flocks and herds

are reconducted to the fields; the butterflies begin to flit from flower

ANNIVERSARY WEEK.

In addition to the usual religious societies which hold their
anniversaries in this city during the second week in May,
we have this season a convention of Infidels, whose meetings
are held in a small brick building in Broadway called the
Coliseum. The city was startled at the sight of placards on
the corners of all the principal streets, headed Infidel Con-
vention, notifying the people that a meeting of infidels would
be held at certain hours during Sunday. We like the hon-
esty of these people, in proclaiming their Infidelity, although
it appears that the great man among them, Mr. Owen, ob-
jected to the term, and preferred being called, a “ friend of uni-
versal freedom and unlimited charity,” which is a very com-
prehensive designation, but not a very forcible one. The
Tribune makes some strange comments upon this convention,
which we do not fully comprehend, but they appear to us
highly commendatory. “ Saying nothing of the influence of
belief,” says the paper, “ who can doubt that the isolated condi-
tion of all infidels, their independence of the restraining influ-
ence of sympathy and fellowship are clearly unfavorable to
high moral attainments? We rejoice, then, that they have
resolved to know each other, and fix upon some definite and
endearing plan of organization and action.”

This is surely very distinct and unequivocal. A paper
possessing the immense circulation of the Tribune, which is
taken in many pious families for the reason that it excludes
theatrical advertisements, and other wicked matter from its
columns, is rejoiced that the infidels in this country have had
the shrewdness to adopt the machinery by which other class-
es of men contrive to strengthen themselves in their errors,
and trusts that they may fix upon some plan for rendering
their infidelity enduring. The want of “high moral at-
tainments” among infidels, the Tribune attributes to the
isolated manner in which they have heretofore lived, and
thinks that by meeting together frequently, and adopting the
machinery of a party, whereby they may become more thor-
oughly imbued with infidelity, that their morals will be im-
proved. The morality and the reasoning of the Tribune are
decidedly original, and we would advise the proprietors to
get out a patent for them.

It appears that Mrs. Rose, the somewhat celebrated clair-
voyante, a Polish lady, who resides in this city, was among
the speakers at the Coliseum, and that Judge Herttell was
appointed chairman. The Tribune says that Robert Owen
addressed the meeting briefly and sensibly, and of the con-
vention it expresses the belief that “ an elevation of the aims
and an improvement of the morals of many will be the con-
sequence.” The Tribune, according to its manner of reason-
ing in the premises, would be rejoiced to see a convention of
counterfeiters or pickpockets, or horse thieves, for the isolated
manner in which these people live is very destructive to the
social sympathies, and “ devotion to their party or sex, soli-
citude for us welfare, and pride in its respectability would
make them behave better than they otherwise would.”

The wisdom of conventions, even for professedly benevo-
lent purposes, is very questionable, but there can be no ques-
tion of the evil which must result from party machinery,
being adopted by men whose sole object is to bind them-
selves in a compact of infidelity.

No less than twenty-three different associations, mostly
religious, have held their anniversaries during the week.
Among the societies, we perceive one of a winning title, the
“National Reform Association.” We should suppose that
everybody would be anxious to enrol themselves among its
members ; yet it appears that only twenty-five persons
gathered together at its anniversary, which, after all, is
about the number of men in the country who are favorable
to National Reform. The Foreign Evangelical Society can
number its thousands of members. Our Charity is not one

of the domestic virtues; she begins abroad, and, in many
cases ends there.

In New Haven there has been a grand gathering of Scientific
Gentlemen during the last week, and much important infor-
mation has been disseminated, and many curious discoveries
made public. One of the members discovered a fossil pun,
which seemed to afford the association a vast amount of
pleasure, it being probably the first discovery of the kind
ever made.

Somebody gave an account of marks which had been
found on a rock, resembling the human foot without toes, or a
foot with the toes frozen off. Professor Silliman, junior re-
marked that it had long been a no-toe-rious fact.

With unkempt hair, and shoeless feet,

The untitled sov’reign of the street,

With broom in hand,

Of charity may crave a mite,—

Pass him not by, it is a sight
He may command.

Pass him not by without a sign,

You recognize the shape divine
In him, though poor;

Kind words, if not a coin, will soothe,

And make his rugged pathway smooth,

More than before.

Pass him not by ! Ye know not men,

But God with his omniscient ken
Has placed him there,

To make his country’s annals bright,

When the plebeian claims his right
And spurns despair.

Ay! ’neath that tattered, brimless hat,

May rest a spirit great as that
Which shook the world,

And bent all Europe to its rod,

While kings who ruled by grace of God,

From thrones were hurled.

A time may come when ’neath a sky,

Brighter than that dark canopy,

That shades him now;

He yet may stand to clear your way,

And pointing out a brighter day,

Enwreathe his brow.

The head now pillowing on a stone,

Despised, uncared for, and lone,

May one day rise,

High plumed on its eagle wings,

To sit above your sceptred kings,

Eloquent, wise !	s. A. W-

MUSICAL ITEMS.

The Bcehm Flute.—We rarely have the good fortune to
be able to chronicle one really useful improvement in music-
al instruments; numberless modern inventions come under
our notice daily, but they are, for the most part, if not entire-
ly, valueless—of but little practical advantage.

The Boehm Flute is, however, a noble exception; we
look upon it as the most valuable improvement ever effected
in this instrument; and we believe, although there is no
limit to the ingenuity of the human intellect, that it brings
the flute as near perfection as it ever will be. It not only
renders every scale of the instrument comparatively easy,
but it ensures, beyond every contingency, that every scale
shall be in perfect tune. It renders also the upper and the
lower tones very easy to produce, while it improves and
equalizes the tone throughout. Passages which were im
practicable upon the old flute can be played with perfect fa

cility upon the Boehm flute, while, added to all these advan-
tages, and many more advantages which we shall take an
early opportunity of pointing out to amateur and profession-
al players, the exterior appearance of the flute is much im-
proved and beautified.

A strong feeling of prejudice was exhibited against the
Boehm innovation, as it was arrogantly called, by profession-
al players, both here and in Europe; but its striking advan-
tages and sterling excellence silenced them one by one, and
the Boehm flute is now universally adopted.

To Mr. W. J. Davis, the talented flutist, every honor must
be given as the first man who had the boldness to introduce
it into this country ; and to Mr. Larrabee, the ingenious ma-
ker, the public and the professors owe a debt of gratitude for
his sacrifice of self-interest, in substituting the new for the
old flute.

We hope that all who are interested in this subject, and
have not yet examined the Boehm flute, may be induced by
our notice to visit Mr. Larrabee’s factory, 110 Fulton street.
We have examined the instrument thoroughly, and can vouch
for its excellence in every way.

Grand Sacred Concert at St. Peter’s Church.—We call the
attention of our readers to the advertisement of this Concert in our
present number. It will be seen that a truly classical and yet popu-
lar programme is offered on this occasion. The selections are from
the finest composers, ancient and modern. Mozart, Handel, Hayden,
Mendelssohn, Rossini and other names of note, give warranty of the
excellence of the selection. The solos and chorusses from St. Paul
will be new to most of our readers. As an entire work, Paulus is un’
doubtedly the greatest work that Mendelssohn has yet produced; for,
lofty sentiment, profound thought, and exquisite melody, no recent 
composition has approached it. The Loblgesang has also, only once
been produced in this country, and the selections from it cannot fail to
add the charm of novelty to the programme.

Mrs. Edward Loder, Miss De Luce, Miss Schmidt, Miss Watson,
and Mr. Masset sustain the principal parts, while the chorus, com-
posed principally of the members of the New-York Vocal Society, so
favourably known to the public, is announced to be full and effective.
It will be under the direction of Mr. H. C. Watson.

Mr. William A. King, organist of St. Peter’s, whose reputation in
that department is widely spread throughout the States, is engaged
to get the concert up. Mr. H. C. Timm performs with Mr. W. A
King a four-handed piece for the organ.

The Concert is for the benefit of the Funds of the Church, which, 
independent of the musical attraction will doubtless be sufficient to
fill the Church.

THE BROADWAY THEATRE.

Mr. Hamblin has made a very touching appeal to the citi-
zens of New York, and proposes borrowing one hundred
thousand dollars, in the ridiculously small sums (as Mr. Tigg
would say) of one dollar, from the same number of individu-
als, for which he will issue scrip entitling subscribers to a
dollar’s worth of admissions to his theatre when it shall be
finished. This is certainly a very ingenious scheme for rais-
ing a hundred thousand dollars ; but without a particle of ill
will towards Mr. Hamblin, whom we have not the pleasure
of knowing, we cannot say that we wish he may get it. For 
we should regret exceedingly to see a theatre erected in
Broadway, more especially such a theatre as Mr. Hamblin 
would probably put up. Considering the effect which thea-
tres invariably have in the neighborhood where they have
been built, we should expect that the owners of property in
Broadway would protest against the erection of one in that
noble thoroughfare. The little Olympic is probably the best
conducted theatre in the city ; but we see it surrounded by
dram shops, billiard rooms, and other equivocal resorts for

the profligate and idle. We see no necessity of making a
theatre a drinking house, a gambling house, and a something
else house, as well as a play house, but there seems to be the
real unities of the drama, and pea-nuts and punch are as es-
sential concomitants to the acting drama as tin foil and rouge.
It is one of the strangest things in life, that every institution
has been modified by time excepting the theatre. It is just
as dissolute now as it was in the days of Charles the Second.
Though governed by no laws, and its professors reckoned as
vagrants, it is one of the most conservative institutions among
us. Quakers and Jews change, but the theatre holds to its
old usages. Mr. Simpson is the only man in New York who
has remained unchanged during the past twenty years, and
his theatre is the only building in the city which has not
been renovated. All the churches have been remodeled;
preachers have changed their style, their theology, and their
habits; society has suffered a dozen revolutions; the whole
order of living has been reversed; we have altered our food,
drink, habits, and even our speech; cotillions have gone out,
and the Polka has come in ; finger glasses and silver forks
have become common in hotels; drunkenness has grown
unfashionable; the national name has been changed; new
streets have been built; Texas has been annexed; cheap
books have been invented ; hanging is almost abolished; the
Croton river runs through the streets ;—but Mr. Simpson and
the Park remain the same, as unchangeable as the eternal
sphinx of the desert. He looks as gloomy and saturnine as
he used to look when he played Charles Surface in a claret
colored coat and straw colored shorts ; and his theatre is as
dingy, as English, and as expensive as ever. The filthy sa-
loons, with their red moreen curtains and yellow refreshment
sellers remain unchanged, and probably will remain so for
the next century ; and the same plays are presented on the
stage that were witnessed by our grandmothers and our
grandmothers’ grandmothers. There is no church in Chris-
tendom half so conservative as the theatre: there are isms
in every thing but the drama, which has never known a
schism. Mr. Dinneford, to be sure, got up a Greek tragedy
the other day, which was stepping backward a thousand
years or two, instead of moving forward, as any one must
do who would produce a sensation in the drama ; and it ap-
pears that he lost twenty-five hundred dollars by his devotion
to the classics, which should be a caution to other managers
to let the classics alone.

We have no reason to believe that Mr. Hamblin would
break adrift from the legitimate drama, or that he would do
any better in Broadway than he has heretofore done in the
Bowery; and therefore we would rather see him fail than
succeed in his present undertaking; not that we wish him
any ill as an individual, but as a manager he cannot but do
harm in the community. He has had a large theatre under
his control for many years, but he has done nothing to ele-
vate the drama or correct the corrupt tastes of his audiences.
If Mr. Hamblin must have a theatre, let him by all means
stick to the Bowery. He would be a fish out of water in
Broadway, and his theatre would mar the beauty of our mag-
nificent thoroughfare.

We shall have a theatre in New York by and by, we have
no doubt, that will reflect the manners of the people and
satirise their vices, but it must be under the control of a
manager to the manor born.

We are sorry for Mr. Hamblin’s misfortunes, and would
not put the slightest obstacle in his way to retrieve his loss-
es ; and our remarks are only intended to apply to the erec-
tion of a theatre in Broadway.

THE BROADWAY JOURNAL

Fact and Fiction.—From Thoughts on Reading, in Colton’s Mag-
azine, by H. N. Hudson, the Lecturer on Shakspeare:

“ Good people often seem laboring under a great mistake
in regard to works of fiction. They appear to think of truth
as synonymous with matters of fact, and of fiction as synony- 
mous with falsehood. Now, there is probably nothing that
lies so frequently or so abominably as narratives of facts.
Why, if a man wants to make any falsehood go down, he 
always sweetens it with some “ fact whch came under his 
own observation.” Facts, indeed, we know to be the readi-
est vehicle of lies in the world : and whenever one under- 
takes to inflict them on us, we take for granted that there is
no truth in him; or that, if there be, it is not coming out
this time. On the other hand, as some one has said, the
purest fictions often contain more of truth than many histo-
ries and scientific theories. In Spenser or Cervantes, for
example, perhaps you shall not find a single falsehood, or a
single fact; in a Gibbon or a Paley, you shall scarcely find a
single fiction or a single truth. In the former, all shall be
true but the names; in the latter all but the names shall be
false. Take, for example, Addison’s Cato and Sancho Panza.
Now, Cato is unquestionably a real name; nobody doubts
the existence of such a man ; or that he was a genuine old,
eating, breathing, thinking and speaking Roman, of the
staunchest and noblest make. But Addison's Cato is one of
the sheerest falsehoods that ever was perpetrated ; such a 
being never did exist, and never could exist; all the princi- 
ples of human nature must be changed before his existence
were possible. Sancho Panza, on the contrary, is doubtless
a fictitious name; nobody pretends that a real man ever bore
that name ; but the character is a perfect form of truth ; is
as real as the old Roman Cato was, whom Addison meant to 
give us, but could not; wants, in short, all that Addison’s 
Cato has, and has all that Addison’s Cato wants. And thus 
it is, that, in the hands of an artist, a fiction becomes the 
truest of realities, while, in the hands of a bungler, a fact
becomes the emptiest of falsehoods.

Again ; take Spenser’s Una and Johnson’s Milton. Now,
Una is a mere personification of truth—one of the purest ab-
stractions which the mind can frame, and with which, as
such, we could no more sympathize, than with a triangle or
an octagon. And yet, in Spenser’s hands, it has turned out
a fair humanity, breathing and blushing before us, like life
itself. Uniting all the purity of an abstraction, with the
flesh-and-blood reality of an actual person, we at once revere
her as truth, and feel for her as the real subject of sympa-
thies and affections answering to our own. Here, then, is a
genuine character; a pure abstraction has come out a living
person; a perfect fiction has become a perfect truth. This
is the miracle that genius performs. Milton, on the contra-
ry, is an actual person ; nay, he has stamped his individual-
ity, as a full length portrait, on every page of his works, so
that he who runs may read, provided he have eyes. In
Johnson’s hands, however, he becomes a mere abstraction ;
no longer he, but it ; or rather, a bundle of the mo t incon-
sistent and irreconcilable abstractions. You could no more
mould such elements into the same living character, than
you could mix fire and water, without destroying either.—
Here is a genuine fact turned into a perfect falsehood. This
is the miracle that genius does not perform. We could
multiply instances beyond either our time or the reader’s pa-
tience. It is truth, in this sense, that forms the substance
and the soul of all true books ; and we care not what form
you give it, it is as genuine and as indestructible as the eye
of God.	1

MISCELLANY.

It is an ill wind that blows nobodt good.—The frost

has been so intense on the Danube, that rocks which for centuries had
obstructed the navigation near Lintz, suddenly burst, and thus opened
the bed of the river.

Bursting or Beer.—The famous brewers of Burton Ale,
Messrs. Alsopps, whose names should be written Allslops, have re-
cently failed for the moderate sum of one million and a half of dol-
lars.

Mr. Murdoch, who has been successfully lecturing in
this city upon the Drama and Shakspeare, will make his re-appearance
upon the stage in September. He has an engagement at the Park for
12 nights.

Three faces under a hood, viz. Palmo-hood.—The new
opera house in Chambers street was first occupied by the Italians, then
the Greeks, but now, it appears from the following notice, it is occu-
pied by the Ethiopians.

“ Mr. Dumbleton has at length succeeded in obtaining possession
from Palmo, of the Opera House, and will this evening open it with
the Ethioipan Serenaders.

Mr. Henry Phillips gave his farewell concert at Niblo’s
Saloon last Tuesday evening ; it was well attended, and the perfor-
mances gave great satisfaction. Mr. Phillips sang twelve different
ballads, scenas, &c., many of which were encored, and all were well
received. If he should repeat his visit to this country he would meet
with better encouragement in the large cities on the Atlantic than he
has done. His indifferent success has resulted mainly from an inju-
dicious beginning in the manner of giving his concerts.

Historical Society.—At a very crowded meeting of this

society on Wednesday evening, the Rev. Rufus W. Griswold read a
long and interesting paper in reference to the intellectual history of
the country—with criticisms on the works of several of our most noted
authors. He did not conclude the essay.

Mr. Alters, the Musician.—We had an interesting article on the
burial of this excellent musician, which is crowded out of this week’s
Journal. He died last Saturday at the house of his friend Mr. Timm,
and was buried from the Tabernacle Tuesday morning. The house
was nearly filled by the members of the Philharmonic Society of
which he was a member, and by his personal friends and pupils. The
funeral ceremonies, of which we shall give the particulars, were high-
ly impressive, and admirably adapted to the occasion.

The Mirror of last week contains a poem of much merit,
entitled “ The Gazelle.’’ It is the composition of a mere boy of fif-
teen, C. C. Cooke, and, although professedly an imitation of “ The
Raven,” has a very great deal of original power.

MR. AND MRS. KIRKLAND’S

SCHOOL FOR YOUNG LADIES,

No. 255 Greene Street,

One door above Waverly Place, New York.

THIS School differs essentially from most others in

this city, in one particular: the number admitted is so limited that each
scholar receives the personal attention and instruction of the principals.

Mr. Kirkland resided some years in Europe for the express purpose of

qualifying himself as an instructor.

The French language is taught by an approved master, a native of France,
and every facility is afforded for practice, both in the school and in the family.

The plan of instruction embraces three divisions. The Initiatory Course in-
cludes Grammar, Geography, American History, Writing and Arithmetic,
with Composition. Reading aloud, Spelling and Definition, form part of the
daily exercises of the whole school.	

The Second continues the above-named studies, with the addition of An-
cient and Modern History and the French Language.

In the higher or AEsthetic course all the usual branches of a thorough En-
glish course of education are included, with French, German, Latin and
Greek, according to the wish of the parent and the capacity of the scholar.
Pupils in this course pay particular attention to Poetry, to the art of Com-
position, and to the Philosophy of History. Moral Philosophy is taught from

Dymond, as abridged and prepared for schools by Mrs. Kirkland. Lectures
on various subjects are delivered by Mr. and Mrs. Kirkland, and others; and
the general course of study is advanced and rendered interesting by copious
illustrations from French and English Literature.

BERTINI’S METHOD FOR THE PIANO.

THIS is the only thorough, complete and progressive

work yet published in this country. Where pupils here used this method
the most rapid advancement has been observed in all cases. The most prom-
inent feature of this work is that the lessons, exercises, scales and studies, are
given in such progressive order, that they enlist the interest of pupils, and
carry them almost imperceptibly through those mechanical difficulties which,
otherwise, are too often made irksome in other instruction books. The time
has arrived when a superficial knowledge of the Piano is of but little account,
and it is only by the study of such methods as Bertini’s that pupils will be en
abled to READ music with facility, and at the same time become good musi-

cians.

 This method commences in the most plain and simple manner ; the rud-
ments of music being given and illustrated at the same time, and each lesson
is fully explained by marginal notes on the same page.

The publishers are in possession of the highest reccommendations from pro-
fessional gentleman, who speak of the superior merits of Bertini’s Method
over all others yet published in this country, most of them having used the
foreign copies previously. It will only be necessary to give a few of the
names in the principal cities.

REPUBLICATION OF THE FOREIGN MAGAZINES.

L ONDON, EDINBURGH, FOREIGN, and WEST-

MINSTER QUARTERLY REVIEWS, and BLACKWOOD’S MAGA-
ZINE.

The above Periodicals are reprinted in New-York, immediately on their
arrival by the British steamers, in a beautiful clear type, on fine white paper
and are faithful copies of the originals—Blackwood’s Magazine being an ex-
act fac-simile of the Edinburgh Edition.

The wide spread fame of these splendid Periodicals renders it needless to
say much to their praise. As Literary organs, they stand far in advance of
any works of a similar stamp now published, while their political complexion
is marked by a dignity, candor, and forbearance not often found in works of
a party character.

They embrace the views of the three great parties in England, Whig, Tory,
and Radical. “Blackwood” and the “ London Quarterly ” are Tory; the
“ Edinburgh Review” Whig ; and the “ Westminster” Radical. The “For-
eign Quarterly” is purely literary, being devoted principally to criticisms on
foreign Continental Works.

The prices of the Re-Prints are less than one third of those of the foreign
copies ; and while they are equally well got up, they afford all that advan-
tage to the American over the English reader.
